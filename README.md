# Project Description
The aim of the project is to collect, analysize, and present information on the use of language in the context of gender. Using of keyword analysis, I hope to show that there is a significant difference in the ways that we talk about men and women on the platform. I will be looking at the frequncy of certain words and phrases, and more TBD. This project will focus mainly on STEM fields but may also branch out to other fields. The purpose of this repo is to house all of the material produced by this project.
