{"name": "Issai Schur", "content": "\n Issai Schur (January 10, 1875 \u2013 January 10, 1941[1]) was a Russian mathematician who worked in Germany for most of his life. He studied at the University of Berlin. He obtained his doctorate in 1901, became lecturer in 1903 and, after a stay at the University of Bonn, professor in 1919.\n As a student of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, he worked on group representations (the subject with which he is most closely associated), but also in combinatorics and number theory and even theoretical physics. He is perhaps best known today for his result on the existence of the Schur decomposition and for his work on group representations (Schur's lemma).\n Schur published under the name of both I. Schur, and J. Schur, the latter especially in Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik. This has led to some confusion.[2]\n Issai Schur was born into a Jewish family, the son of the businessman Moses Schur and his wife Golde Schur (n\u00e9e Landau). He was born in Mogilev on the Dnieper River in what was then the Russian Empire. Schur used the name Schaia  (Isaiah as the epitaph on his grave) rather than Issai up in his middle twenties.[3] Schur's father may have been a wholesale merchant.[4]\n In 1888, at the age of 13, Schur went to Liep\u0101ja (Courland, now in Latvia), where his married sister and his brother lived, 640\u00a0km north-west of Mogilev. Kurland was one of the three Baltic governorates of Tsarist Russia, and since the Middle Ages the Baltic Germans were the upper social class.[5][6] The local Jewish community spoke mostly German and not Yiddish.[7]\n Schur attended the German-speaking Nicolai Gymnasium in Libau from 1888 to 1894 and reached the top grade in his final examination, and received a gold medal.[8] Here he became fluent in German.\n In October 1894, Schur attended the University of Berlin, with concentration in mathematics and physics. In 1901, he graduated summa cum laude under Frobenius and Lazarus Immanuel Fuchs with his dissertation On a class of matrices that can be assigned to a given matrix,[9] which contains a general theory of the representation of linear groups. According to Vogt,[10] he began to use the name Issai at this time. Schur thought that his chance of success in the Russian Empire was rather poor,[11] and because he spoke German so perfectly, he remained in Berlin. He graduated in 1903 and was a lecturer at the University of Berlin. Schur held a position as professor at the Berlin University for the ten years from 1903 to 1913.[12]\n In 1913 he accepted an appointment as associate professor and successor of Felix Hausdorff at the University of Bonn. In the following years Frobenius tried various ways to get Schur back to Berlin. Among other things, Schur's name was mentioned in a letter dated June 27, 1913[13] from Frobenius to Robert Gnehm (the School Board President of the ETH)  as a possible successor to Carl Friedrich Geiser.[14] Frobenius complained that they had never followed his advice before and then said: \"That is why I can't even recommend Prof. J. Schur (now in Bonn) to you. He's too good for Zurich, and should be my successor in Berlin\". Hermann Weyl got the job in Zurich. The efforts of Frobenius were finally successful in 1916, when Schur succeeded Johannes Knoblauch as adjunct professor. Frobenius died a year later, on August 3, 1917. Schur and Carath\u00e9odory were both named as the frontrunners for his successor. But they chose Constantin Carath\u00e9odory in the end. In 1919 Schur finally received a personal professorship, and in 1921 he took over the chair of the retired Friedrich Hermann Schottky. In 1922, he was also added to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.[citation needed]\n After the takeover by the Nazists and the elimination of the parliamentary opposition, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service on April 7, 1933, prescribed the release of all distinguished public servants that held unpopular political opinions or who were \"Jewish\" in origin; a subsequent regulation[15] extended this to professors and therefore also to Schur. Schur was suspended and excluded from the university system. His colleague Erhard Schmidt fought for his reinstatement, and since Schur had been a Prussian official before the First World War,[16] he was allowed to participate in certain special lectures on teaching in the winter semester of 1933/1934 again. Schur withdrew his application for leave from the Science Minister and passed up the offer of a visiting professorship at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison for the academic year 1933\u201334.[17] One element that likely played a role in the rejection of the offer was that Schur no longer felt he could cope with the requirements that would have come with a new beginning in an English-speaking environment.[18]\n Already in 1932, Schur's daughter Hilde had married the doctor Chaim Abelin in Bern.[19] As a result, Issai Schur visited his daughter in Bern several times. In Zurich he met often with George P\u00f3lya, with whom he was on friendly terms since before the First World War.[20]\n On such a trip to Switzerland in the summer of 1935, a letter reached Schur from Ludwig Bieberbach signed on behalf of the Rector's, stating that Schur should urgently seek him out in the University of Berlin.[21] They needed to discuss an important matter with him. It involved Schur's dismissal on September 30, 1935.[22]\n Schur remained a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences after his release as a professor, but a little later he lost this last remnant of his official position. Due to an intervention from Bieberbach in the spring of 1938 he was forced to explain his resignation from the commission of the Academy.[23] His membership in the Advisory Board of the Mathematical Journal was ended in early 1939.[24]\n Schur found himself lonely after the flight of many of his students and the expulsion of renowned scientists from his previous place of work. Only Dr. Helmut Grunsky had been friendly to him, as Schur reported in the late thirties to his expatriate student Max Menachem Schiffer.[25] The Gestapo was everywhere. Since Schur had announced to his wife his intentions to commit suicide in case of a summons to the Gestapo,[26] in the summer of 1938 his wife took his letters, and with them a summons from the Gestapo, sent Issai Schur to a relaxing stay in a home outside of Berlin and went with medical certificate allowing her to meet the Gestapo in place of her husband. There they flatly asked why they were still staying in Germany. But there were economic obstacles to the planned emigration: emigrating Germans had a pre-departure Reich Flight Tax to pay, which was a quarter of their assets. Now Schur's wife had inherited a mortgage on a house in Lithuania, which because of the Lithuanian foreign exchange determination could not be repaid. On the other hand, Schur was forbidden to default or leave the mortgage to the German Reich. Thus the Schurs lacked cash and cash equivalents. Finally, the missing sum of money was somehow supplied, and to this day it does not seem to be clear who were the donors.\n Schur was able to leave Germany in early 1939.[27] His health, however, was already severely compromised. He traveled in the company of a nurse to his daughter in Bern, where his wife also followed a few days later. There they remained for several weeks and then emigrated to Palestine.  Two years later, on his 66th birthday, on January 10, 1941, he died in Tel Aviv of a heart attack.[citation needed]\n Schur continued the work of his teacher Frobenius with many important works for group theory and representation theory. In addition, he published important results and elegant proofs of known results in almost all branches of classical algebra and number theory. His collected works[28] are an impressive proof of this. There, his work on the theory of integral equations and infinite series can be found.\n In his doctoral thesis \u00dcber eine Klasse von Matrizen, die sich einer gegebenen Matrix zuordnen lassen Issai Schur determined the polynomial representations of the general linear group \n\n\n\nG\nL\n(\nn\n,\n\nC\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle GL(n,\\mathbb {C} )}\n\n on the field \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} }\n\n of complex numbers.

According to Green, the methods of Schur's dissertation today are important for the theory of algebraic groups.[citation needed]\n In 1927 Schur, in his work On the rational representations of the general linear group, gave new proofs for the main results of his dissertation.

This work of Schur was once very well known.[citation needed]\n Schur lived in Berlin as a highly respected member of the academic world, an apolitical scholar. A leading mathematician and outstanding and very successful teacher, he held a prestigious chair at the University of Berlin for 16 years.[31] Until 1933, his research group had an excellent reputation at the University of Berlin in Germany and beyond. With Schur in the center, his faculty worked with representation theory, which was extended by his students in different directions (including solvable groups, combinatorics, matrix theory).[32]  Schur made fundamental contributions to algebra and group theory which, according to Hermann Weyl, were comparable in scope and depth to those of Emmy Amalie Noether (1882\u20131935).[33]\n When Schur's lectures were canceled in 1933, there was an outcry among the students and professors who appreciated him and liked him.[34] By the efforts of his colleagues Erhard Schmidt Schur was allowed to continue lecturing until the end of September 1935 for the time being.[35] Schur was the last Jewish professor who lost his job at this time.[36]\n In Switzerland, Schur's colleagues Heinz Hopf and George P\u00f3lya were informed of the dismissal of Issai Schur in 1935. They tried to help as best they could.[37] On behalf of the Mathematical Seminars chief Michel Plancherel, on December 12, 1935[38] the school board president Arthur Rohn invited Isay Schur to une s\u00e9rie de conf\u00e9rences sur la th\u00e9orie de la repr\u00e9sentation des groupes finis. At the same time he asked that the formal invitation should come from President Rohn, comme le prof. Schur doit obtenir l'autorisation du minist\u00e8re comp\u00e9tent de donner ces conf\u00e9rences. George P\u00f3lya arranged from this invitation of the Mathematical Seminars the Conference of the Department of Mathematics and Physics on December 16.[39] Meanwhile, on December 14 the official invitation letter from President Rohn had already been dispatched to Issai Schur.[40] Schur was promised for his guest lecture a fee of CHF 500.\n Schur did not reply until January 28, 1936, on which day he was first in the possession of the required approval of the local authority.[41] He declared himself willing to accept the invitation. He envisaged beginning the lecture on February 4.[42] Schur spent most of the month of February in Switzerland. Before his return to Germany he visited his daughter in Bern for a few days, and on February 27 he returned via Karlsruhe, where his sister lived, to Berlin. In a letter to P\u00f3lya from Berne, he concludes with the words: From Switzerland I take farewell with a heavy heart.[43]\n In Berlin, meanwhile, Ludwig Bieberbach, in a letter dated February 20, 1936, informed the Reich Minister for Science, Art, and Education on the journey of Schur, and announced that he wanted to find out what was the content of the lecture in Zurich.[44]\n Schur had a total of 26[45] graduate students, some of whom acquired a mathematical reputation. Among them are\n Among others, the following concepts are named after Issai Schur:\n In his commemorative speech, Alfred Brauer (PhD candidate of Schur) spoke about Issai Schur as follows:[46] As a teacher, Schur was excellent. His lectures were very clear, but not always easy and required cooperation \u2013 During the winter semester of 1930, the number of students who wanted to attend Schur's theory of numbers lecture, was such that the second largest university lecture hall with about 500 seats was too small. His most human characteristics were probably his great modesty, his helpfulness and his human interest in his students.\n Heinz Hopf, who had been in Berlin before his appointment to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held \u2013 as is clear from oral statements and also from letters \u2013 Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George P\u00f3lya on the occasion of the re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. \u2013 If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him.\n Schur was, however, known for putting a correct distance in personal affairs. The testimony of Hopf is in accordance with statements of Schur's former students in Berlin, by Walter Ledermann and Bernhard Neumann.[47]\n ", "tags": ["1875 births", "1941 deaths", "19th-century German mathematicians", "Combinatorialists", "Corresponding Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Group theorists", "Linear algebraists", "Humboldt University of Berlin alumni", "Humboldt University of Berlin faculty", "Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to Mandatory Palestine", "Members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences", "People from Mogilev", "University of Bonn faculty", "Burials at Trumpeldor Cemetery", "Use mdy dates from January 2021", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from January 2018", "Articles with unsourced statements from January 2021", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers", "Pages that use a deprecated format of the math tags"], "raw": "\n\nNot to be confused with Friedrich Schur.\nIssai SchurBorn(1875-01-10)January 10, 1875Mogilev, Russian EmpireDiedJanuary 10, 1941(1941-01-10) (aged\u00a066)Tel Aviv, Mandatory PalestineKnown\u00a0for\nSchur decomposition\nSchur's lemma\nScientific careerFieldsMathematicsDoctoral advisor\nGeorg Frobenius\nLazarus Fuchs\nDoctoral students\nRichard Brauer\nRobert Frucht\nMaximilian Herzberger\nEberhard Hopf\nBernhard Neumann\nRose Peltesohn\nHeinz Pr\u00fcfer\nRichard Rado\nIsaac Jacob Schoenberg\nArnold Scholz\nWilhelm Specht\nKarl D\u00f6rge\nWolfgang Hahn\n\n\nIssai Schur (January 10, 1875 \u2013 January 10, 1941[1]) was a Russian mathematician who worked in Germany for most of his life.

If \n\n\n\nV\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V}\n\n is the natural \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-dimensional \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} }\n\n vector space on which \n\n\n\nG\nL\n(\nn\n,\n\nC\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle GL(n,\\mathbb {C} )}\n\n operates, and if \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n is a natural number, then the \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n-fold tensor product \n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\u2297\nr\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V^{\\otimes r}}\n\n over \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} }\n\n is a \n\n\n\nG\nL\n(\nn\n,\n\nC\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle GL(n,\\mathbb {C} )}\n\n-module, on which the symmetric group  \n\n\n\n\nS\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S_{r}}\n\n of degree \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n also operates by permutation of the tensor factors of each generator \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n1\n\n\n\u2297\n\u2026\n\u2297\n\nv\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v_{1}\\otimes \\ldots \\otimes v_{r}}\n\n of \n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\u2297\nr\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V^{\\otimes r}}\n\n.

This work of Schur was once very well known.[citation needed]\n\nProfessorship in Berlin[edit]\nSchur lived in Berlin as a highly respected member of the academic world, an apolitical scholar. A leading mathematician and outstanding and very successful teacher, he held a prestigious chair at the University of Berlin for 16 years.[31] Until 1933, his research group had an excellent reputation at the University of Berlin in Germany and beyond. With Schur in the center, his faculty worked with representation theory, which was extended by his students in different directions (including solvable groups, combinatorics, matrix theory).[32]  Schur made fundamental contributions to algebra and group theory which, according to Hermann Weyl, were comparable in scope and depth to those of Emmy Amalie Noether (1882\u20131935).[33]\nWhen Schur's lectures were canceled in 1933, there was an outcry among the students and professors who appreciated him and liked him.[34] By the efforts of his colleagues Erhard Schmidt Schur was allowed to continue lecturing until the end of September 1935 for the time being.[35] Schur was the last Jewish professor who lost his job at this time.[36]\n\nZurich lecture[edit]\nIn Switzerland, Schur's colleagues Heinz Hopf and George P\u00f3lya were informed of the dismissal of Issai Schur in 1935. They tried to help as best they could.[37] On behalf of the Mathematical Seminars chief Michel Plancherel, on December 12, 1935[38] the school board president Arthur Rohn invited Isay Schur to une s\u00e9rie de conf\u00e9rences sur la th\u00e9orie de la repr\u00e9sentation des groupes finis. At the same time he asked that the formal invitation should come from President Rohn, comme le prof. Schur doit obtenir l'autorisation du minist\u00e8re comp\u00e9tent de donner ces conf\u00e9rences. George P\u00f3lya arranged from this invitation of the Mathematical Seminars the Conference of the Department of Mathematics and Physics on December 16.[39] Meanwhile, on December 14 the official invitation letter from President Rohn had already been dispatched to Issai Schur.[40] Schur was promised for his guest lecture a fee of CHF 500.\nSchur did not reply until January 28, 1936, on which day he was first in the possession of the required approval of the local authority.[41] He declared himself willing to accept the invitation. He envisaged beginning the lecture on February 4.[42] Schur spent most of the month of February in Switzerland. Before his return to Germany he visited his daughter in Bern for a few days, and on February 27 he returned via Karlsruhe, where his sister lived, to Berlin. In a letter to P\u00f3lya from Berne, he concludes with the words: From Switzerland I take farewell with a heavy heart.[43]\nIn Berlin, meanwhile, Ludwig Bieberbach, in a letter dated February 20, 1936, informed the Reich Minister for Science, Art, and Education on the journey of Schur, and announced that he wanted to find out what was the content of the lecture in Zurich.[44]\n\nSignificant students[edit]\nSchur had a total of 26[45] graduate students, some of whom acquired a mathematical reputation. Among them are\n\nAlfred Brauer, University of Berlin (1928)\nRichard Brauer, University of Berlin (1925)\nKarl D\u00f6rge, University of Berlin (1925)\nBernhard Neumann, University of Berlin, Cambridge University (1932, 1935)\nHeinz Pruefer, University of Berlin,  (1921)\nRichard Rado, University of Berlin, Cambridge University (1933, 1935)\nIsaac Jacob Schoenberg, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Ia\u015fi (1926)\nWilhelm Specht, University of Berlin (1932)\nHelmut Wielandt, University of Berlin (1935)\nLegacy[edit]\nConcepts named after Schur[edit]\nAmong others, the following concepts are named after Issai Schur:\n\n\nList of things named after Issai Schur\nSchur algebra\nSchur complement\nSchur index\nSchur indicator\nSchur multiplier\nSchur orthogonality relations\nSchur polynomial\nSchur product\nSchur test\nSchur's inequality\nSchur's theorem\nSchur-convex function\nSchur\u2013Weyl duality\nLehmer\u2013Schur algorithm\nSchur's property for normed spaces.\nJordan\u2013Schur theorem\nSchur\u2013Zassenhaus theorem\nSchur triple\nSchur decomposition\nSchur's lower bound\n\nQuotes[edit]\nIn his commemorative speech, Alfred Brauer (PhD candidate of Schur) spoke about Issai Schur as follows:[46] As a teacher, Schur was excellent. His lectures were very clear, but not always easy and required cooperation \u2013 During the winter semester of 1930, the number of students who wanted to attend Schur's theory of numbers lecture, was such that the second largest university lecture hall with about 500 seats was too small. His most human characteristics were probably his great modesty, his helpfulness and his human interest in his students.\nHeinz Hopf, who had been in Berlin before his appointment to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held \u2013 as is clear from oral statements and also from letters \u2013 Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George P\u00f3lya on the occasion of the re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. \u2013 If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him.\nSchur was, however, known for putting a correct distance in personal affairs. The testimony of Hopf is in accordance with statements of Schur's former students in Berlin, by Walter Ledermann and Bernhard Neumann.[47]\n\nPublications[edit]\nSchur, Issai (1968),  Grunsky, Helmut (ed.), Vorlesungen \u00fcber Invariantentheorie, Die Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften, 143, Berlin, New York: Springer-Verlag, MR\u00a00229674\nSchur, Issai (1973),  Brauer, Alfred; Rohrbach, Hans (eds.), Gesammelte Abhandlungen, Berlin, New York: Springer-Verlag, ISBN\u00a0978-3-540-05630-0, MR\u00a00462891\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Ledermann, Walter, and Neumann, Peter M.; \"The Life of Issai Schur through Letters and Other Documents\", in Joseph, Melnikov, Rentschler (2003), p. 45.\n\n^ Ledermann, W.
