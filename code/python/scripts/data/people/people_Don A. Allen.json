{"name": "Don A. Allen", "content": "Don A. Allen, also known as Don A. Allen, Sr. (May 13, 1900 - August 1983), was a member of the California State Assembly in the 1940s and 1950s and of the Los Angeles City Council between 1947 and 1956.\n Allen was born on May 13, 1900 or 1907, in Atlantic, Iowa, the son of Thomas Allen of Missouri and Lillian M.

He attended public schools in Iowa and Nebraska, where he studied civil engineering,  and completed courses in engineering science and war training at the University of Southern California and Caltech. He was married to Margaret Sachs or Margaret H. Rogers of Detmold, Germany; they had a son, Don A.
