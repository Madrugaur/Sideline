She was born on July 18, 1908, in Portland, Oregon. Aitchison lived in Portland until 1916 and then in Washington, D.C. for the rest of her childhood.[3]\n Aitchison attended Central High School. She was part of the Phi Beta Kappa sorority[3] and earned a bachelor's degree from Goucher College in 1928.\n After working for a year as an actuary in New York City, she began graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University in mathematics, completing her Master's in 1931 and her Ph.D. in 1933.[1] Her dissertation, supervised by Gordon Thomas Whyburn, was entitled On Mapping with Functions of Finite Sections, and concerned point-set topology;[4] she also published two papers in the same area.\n At the University of Oregon, Aitchison completed a second master's degree in economics in 1937.[5]\n Because of the Great Depression, employment as a mathematician was hard to find: she applied to 145 schools but was only able to find a one-semester temporary position, substituting for a sick instructor at the University of Richmond's Westhampton College for Women.
