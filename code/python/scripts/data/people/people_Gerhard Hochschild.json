{"name": "Gerhard Hochschild", "content": "Gerhard Paul Hochschild (April 29, 1915 in Berlin \u2013 July 8, 2010 in El Cerrito, California) was a German-born American mathematician who worked on Lie groups, algebraic groups, homological algebra and algebraic number theory.\n On April 29, 1915, Hochschild was born in Berlin, Germany.[1] Hochschild's father was a patent attorney who had an engineering degree. Hochschild had an older brother.[1]\n In 1936, Hochschild earned a BS degree in mathematics from University of Cape Town in Union of South Africa.[1] In 1937, Hochschild earned a MS degree in mathematics from University of Cape Town.[1]\nIn 1941, Hochschild earned his PhD in mathematics from Princeton University.[1] Hochschild completed his thesis in 1941 at Princeton University with Claude Chevalley on Semisimple Algebras and Generalized Derivations.\n In 1956\u20137 Hochschild was at the Institute for Advanced Study. Hochschild was a professor at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In the late 1950s Hochschild was a professor at University of California, Berkeley.\n Hochschild (1945) introduced Hochschild cohomology, a cohomology theory for algebras, which classifies deformations of algebras.
