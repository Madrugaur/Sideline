From 1968-1983, Pope served as co-director of the RSSL. From 1983-1988, he was director of the RSSL.\n1988\u2013present: Professor emeritus, physical chemistry.\nScientific Research and Discoveries[edit]\nDark charge injecting (ohmic) contacts -- the basis of operation of essentially every organic semiconductor.\nSensitized photoinjection -- demonstrated that the processes of carrier generation and carrier transport could be separated and is used in modern electrophotography and molecularly doped polymers.  It is also the basis of Dye-Sensitized Excitonic Solar Cells.\nPhotovoltaic effect using identical electrodes -- discovery of the exciton-induced photovoltaic effect makes possible high photovoltages.\nIn Electrochemistry -- discovery of dark charge injection using electrolyte electrodes created a new field of electrochemistry, based on organic electrodes. This has made biosensors possible.\nElectroluminescence in organic semiconductors -- opened a field of semiconductors that has led to the development of the modern organic light-emitting diodes (OLED).\nAutoionization -- This discovery and that of the closely related charge transfer process, is the presently accepted mechanism for intrinsic photocarrier generation.\nInitial (geminate) recombination -- provided the presently accepted explanation for the small photoionization efficiency in low dielectric constant organic molecular semiconductors. (Discovered concurrently by Kepler and Coppage).\nTwo-quantum external photoelectric effect in organic crystals\nExciton charge transfer, fission and caging\nPhotophoretic spectroscopy\nThin films -- patents for the development of low temperature coefficient resistive and capacitive film, electrically conducting thin film polymeric hygrometer and thin film hermetically sealed resistors.\nPublications, Awards[edit]\nwith Charles E. Swenberg: Electronic Processes in Organic Crystals (1982; Oxford University Press)\nOriginated the conference: \"Electronic Processes in Organic Materials\", Gordon Research Conferences.\nInternational conference: \"Electronic Processes in the Organic Condensed Phase: a Symposium in Honor of Professor Martin Pope\", held at NYU in 1988.\nwith Charles E.
