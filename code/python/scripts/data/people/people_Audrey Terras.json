{"name": "Audrey Terras", "content": "Audrey Anne Terras (born September 10, 1942) is an American mathematician who works primarily in number theory. Her research has focused on quantum chaos and on various types of zeta functions.\n Audrey Terras was born September 10, 1942, in Washington, D.C.[1]\nShe received a BS degree in mathematics from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1964, and MA and PhD degrees from Yale University in 1966 and 1970 respectively.[2]\nShe stated in a 2008 interview that she chose to study mathematics because \"The U.S. government paid me! And not much! It was the time of Sputnik, so we needed to produce more mathematicians, and when I was deciding between Math and History, they weren\u2019t paying me to do history, they were paying me to do math.\"[3]\n Terras joined the University of California, San Diego as an assistant professor in 1972, and became a full professor there in 1983.[4] She retired in 2010,[4] and currently holds the title of Professor Emerita.[5]\n As an undergraduate Terras was inspired by her teacher Sigekatu Kuroda to become a number theorist; she was especially interested in the use of analytic techniques to get algebraic results. Today her research interests are in number theory, harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces and finite groups, special functions, algebraic graph theory, zeta functions of graphs, arithmetical quantum chaos, and the Selberg trace formula.[4]\n Terras was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1982.[1] She was the Association for Women in Mathematics-\nMathematical Association of America AWM/MAA Falconer Lecturer in 2000, speaking on \"Finite Quantum Chaos,\"[6]\nand the AWM's Noether Lecturer in 2008, speaking on \"Fun with Zeta Functions of Graphs\".[7] In 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[8]\nShe is part of the 2019 class of fellows of the Association for Women in Mathematics.[9]\n \n ", "tags": ["20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "Number theorists", "Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Fellows of the Association for Women in Mathematics", "University of Maryland, College Park alumni", "Yale University alumni", "University of California, San Diego faculty", "1942 births", "Living people", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nAudrey TerrasBorn (1942-09-10) September 10, 1942 (age\u00a078)Washington, D.C.Alma\u00a0materYale UniversityAwardsFellow of the AAASNoether LecturerAWM/MAA Falconer LecturerScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of California San DiegoDoctoral advisorTsuneo TamagawaDoctoral studentsDorothy Wallace\n\nAudrey Anne Terras (born September 10, 1942) is an American mathematician who works primarily in number theory.
