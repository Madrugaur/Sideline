{"name": "S. Barry Cooper", "content": "\n S. Barry Cooper (9 October 1943 \u2013 26 October 2015) was an English mathematician and computability theorist. He was a professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Leeds. \n Cooper grew up in Bognor Regis and attended Chichester High School for Boys, during which time he played scrum-half for the under-15s England rugby team.[1]\n Cooper graduated from Jesus College, Oxford in 1966, and in 1970 received his PhD from University of Leicester under the supervision of Reuben Goodstein and C.E.M. Yates, with a thesis entitled Degrees of Unsolvability. In the 1970s, he was also a leading figure in the Chile Solidarity Campaign, welcoming Chilean refugees to Leeds.\n Cooper was appointed Lecturer in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds in 1969, where he remained for the rest of his career.  He was promoted to Reader in Mathematical Logic in 1991 and to Professor of Pure Mathematics in 1996. In 2011, he was awarded an honorary doctorate \nat the University of Sofia \"St. Kliment Ohridski\".\n His book Computability Theory made the technical research area accessible to a new generation of students.  He was a leading mover of the return to basic questions of the kind considered by Alan Turing, and of interdisciplinary developments related to computability. He was President of the Association Computability in Europe, and Chair of the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee (TCAC) which \nco-ordinated the Alan Turing Year. The book Alan Turing: His Work and Impact, edited by Cooper and Jan van Leeuwen, won the Association of American Publishers' R. R. Hawkins Award.\n He was a keen long-distance runner, and was also interested in jazz and improvised music, founding Leeds Jazz and being involved in the Termite Club. Cooper died on 26 October 2015 after a short illness.[2]\n Cooper was a member of the editorial board for The Rutherford Journal.[3]\n \n ", "tags": ["1943 births", "2015 deaths", "British logicians", "English logicians", "20th-century British mathematicians", "20th-century English mathematicians", "21st-century British mathematicians", "21st-century English mathematicians", "Alumni of Jesus College, Oxford", "Alumni of the University of Leicester", "Academics of the University of Leeds", "British philosophers", "English philosophers", "EngvarB from December 2017", "Use dmy dates from December 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nS.
