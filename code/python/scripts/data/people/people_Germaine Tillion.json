{"name": "Germaine Tillion", "content": "Germaine Tillion (30 May 1907 \u2013 18 April 2008) was a French ethnologist, best known for her work in Algeria in the 1950s on behalf of the French government. A member of the French resistance, she spent time in the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp.\n Tillion was born on May 30, 1907 in Allegre (Haute-Loire) in south-central France.[1] She was the daughter of Lucien Tillion, a magistrate, and \u00c9milie Cussack Tillion.[2] Her mother was also noted as an art historian and a French resistance fighter.[3][2]\n Tillion had a sister called Francoise.[2]\n Tillion spent her youth with her family in Clermont-Ferrand. She left for Paris to study social anthropology with Marcel Mauss and Louis Massignon, obtaining degrees from the \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes, the \u00c9cole du Louvre, and the INALCO. Four times between 1934 and 1940 she did fieldwork in Algeria,[4] studying the Berber and Chaoui people in the Aures region of northeastern Algeria, to prepare for her doctorate in anthropology.\n As Tillion returned to Paris from the field in 1940, France had been invaded by Germany. As her first act of resistance, she helped a Jewish family by giving them her family's papers. She became one of the members in the French Resistance in the network of the Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme in Paris. Her missions included helping prisoners to escape and organizing intelligence for the allied forces from 1940 to 1942.\n Betrayed by the priest Robert Alesch who had joined her resistance network and gained her confidence, she was arrested on August 13, 1942.[citation needed] She was transported in the Convoi des 31000 in 1943.[5]\n On 21 October 1943 Tillion was sent to the German concentration camp of Ravensbr\u00fcck, near Berlin with her mother, \u00c9milie, also a resistante. From her arrival on 21 October 1943 to the fall of the camp in spring 1945, she secretly wrote an operetta comedy to entertain the fellow prisoners. \"Le Verf\u00fcgbar aux Enfers\" describes the camp life of the \"Verf\u00fcgbar\" (German for \"available\", the lowest class of prisoners who could be used for any kind of work).[citation needed] At the same time she undertook a precise ethnographic analysis of the concentration camp. Other prisoners included Genevi\u00e8ve de Gaulle-Anthonioz, Jacqueline Fleury and Fleury's mother.\n Her mother was killed in the camp in March 1945. Tillion escaped Ravensbr\u00fcck in the spring of that year in a rescue operation of the Swedish Red Cross that had been negotiated by Folke Bernadotte.\n In 1973, she published Ravensbruck: An eyewitness account of a women's concentration camp,[6] detailing both her own personal experiences as an inmate as well as her remarkable contemporary and post-war research into the functioning of the camps, movements of prisoners, administrative operations and covert and overt crimes committed by the SS. She reported the presence of a gas chamber at Ravensbruck when other scholars had written that none existed in the Western camps, and affirmed that executions escalated during the waning days of the war, a chilling tribute to the efficiency and automated nature of the Nazi \"killing machines.\"\n She documents the dual but conflicting purposes of the camps; on the one hand, to carry out the Final Solution as quickly as possible, and on the other, to manage a very large and profitable slave labor force in support of the war effort (with profits reportedly going to SS leadership, a business structure created by Himmler himself).\n Finally, she gives chilling vignettes of prisoners, prison staff, and the \"professionals\" who were central to the operation and execution of increasingly bizarre Nazi mandates in an attempt to explore the twisted psychology and outright evil behavior of often average participants who were instrumental in allowing, and then nurturing the death machines.\n After the war Tillion worked on the history of the Second World War, the war crimes of the Nazis and the Soviet Gulags from 1945-1954. She started an education program for French prisoners. As a professor (directeur d'\u00e9tudes) of the \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales she undertook 20 scientific missions in North Africa and the Middle East.\n Tillion returned to Algeria in 1954 to observe and analyze the situation at the brink of the Algerian War of Independence. She described as the principal cause of the conflict the pauperization (\"clochardisation\") of the Algerian population. In order to ameliorate the situation, she launched 'Social Centers' in October 1955, intended to make available higher education as well as vocational training to the rural population, allowing them to survive in the cities.\n On 4 July 1957 during the battle of Algiers, she secretly met with National Liberation Front leader Yacef Saadi, at the instigation of the latter, to try to end the spiral of executions and indiscriminate attacks. Tillion was among the first to denounce the use of torture by French forces in the war.\n Tillion remained vocal on several political topics:\n In 2004 along with several other French intellectuals, she launched a statement against torture in Iraq.\n To celebrate her 100th birthday, her operetta \"Le Verf\u00fcgbar aux Enfers\" premiered in 2007 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris. She was Honorary Professor at France's School of Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS) at the time of her death in 2008.\n ", "tags": ["1907 births", "2008 deaths", "Burials at the Panth\u00e9on, Paris", "People from Haute-Loire", "French anthropologists", "French women anthropologists", "Algerian War", "Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp survivors", "French centenarians", "Grand Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Commanders Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit (France)", "Recipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)", "Recipients of the Resistance Medal", "School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences faculty", "Prix mondial Cino Del Duca winners", "Female recipients of the Croix de Guerre (France)", "People who rescued Jews during the Holocaust", "Female resistance members of World War II", "Women centenarians", "French women in World War II", "20th-century anthropologists", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from January 2021", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2015", "CS1 maint: others", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French anthropologist\nGermaine TillionBorn(1907-05-30)30 May 1907All\u00e8gre, Haute-Loire, FranceDied18 April 2008(2008-04-18) (aged\u00a0100)Saint-Mand\u00e9, FranceEducation\u00c9cole du Louvre\u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes\u00c9cole des langues orientalesOccupationAnthropologistParent(s)\u00c9milie Tillion (mother)\nGermaine Tillion (30 May 1907 \u2013 18 April 2008) was a French ethnologist, best known for her work in Algeria in the 1950s on behalf of the French government.
