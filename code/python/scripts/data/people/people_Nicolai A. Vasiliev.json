{"name": "Nicolai A.

He was a forerunner of paraconsistent and multi-valued logics.\n Vasiliev was born on June 29 O.S., 1880 in Kazan, Russia. His father, Professor Alexander V. Vasiliev, was a fairly well known mathematician, his grandfather was the outstanding sinologist Professor Vassily P. Vasiliev,  and his great grandfather was the prominent astronomer Ivan M. Simonov, who was a close colleague of Nikolai Lobachevsky.\n Wanting to  be a psychologist, Vasiliev studied at the medical faculty and  the historico-philological faculty of Kazan University (1906), where he was offered the position of privat-dozent in 1910.[1]\n As a university student, Vasiliev was enthusiastic about symbolist style poetry and  published some books of verses of his own (for example,\"The longing  for  eternity\")  and  translations  of the poetry of Emile Verhaeren  and Algernon Charles Swinburne.\n Although Vasiliev outlined an abstract to the article on the \"logic of relatives\"  by Charles Sanders Peirce as early as in 1897, it was only in 1908 that he entirely devoted himself to logic.\n On May 18, 1910  Vasiliev presented a lecture (published in October that same year) \"On Partial Judgements,  on the Triangle of Opposites,  on  the  Law  of Excluded Third\" in which he put forward for the first time ever the idea of (non-Aristotelian)  logic,  free  of  the laws of excluded middle and contradiction.  Reasoning by analogy with the \"imaginary\" geometry of Lobachevsky, Vasiliev called  his  novel  logic \"imaginary\", for he assumed it was valid for the worlds where the above-mentioned laws did not hold, worlds with beings having other types of sensations. He distinguished levels of logical reasoning, and introduced the notion of metalogic.\n Vasiliev spent 1912-13 in Western Europe (mostly Germany)  and published his  salient  works  \"Logic  and  Metalogic\"  and \"Imaginary (non-Aristotelian) logic\".  Vasiliev constructed  non-Aristotelian logic using  the concepts, and even the manner of reasoning, common\nto Aristotelian logic.  He was aware of the achievement in mathematical logic (and even carefully studied Ernst Schr\u00f6der's works) but did not make an attempt to formalise \"imaginary\" logic.\n His only work in a foreign language (English) - a concise abstract of his \"imaginary logic\" -  was published in Naples in 1924.\n In 1914, when  World War I broke out, Vasiliev was drafted into the army, where he became seriously mentally ill.  Nevertheless, he  returned  to teaching at Kazan University, but in 1922 was forcibly retired by the new Bolshevik administration. This act aggravated his  ailment:  Vasiliev spent most of the following 20 years in a mental hospital, thus rescued from the Stalin regime.  He died  on  December 31, 1940. The place where he was buried is unknown.[2]\n The pioneer ideas of Vasiliev  were  rediscovered in  the  early 1960s by Vladimir Smirnov, and formed a basis mainly for paraconsistent logic. Some well-known scholars in the 1960s considered his work to be the precursor of multi-valued logic.  The informal style and conceptual riches of Vasiliev's works make them especially valuable. In 2012 an international conference on Vasiliev's work was held in Moscow where a number of important modern paraconsistent logicians contributed.[3]\n ", "tags": ["1880 births", "1940 deaths", "Russian logicians", "People from Kazan", "20th-century Russian mathematicians", "20th-century Russian philosophers", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Nicolai Alexandrovich Vasiliev (Russian: \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432), also Vasil'ev, Vassilieff, Wassilieff (11 July\u00a0[O.S. 29 June]\u00a01880\u00a0\u2013 December 31, 1940), was a Russian logician, philosopher, psychologist, poet.
