{"name": "Pieter van Musschenbroek", "content": "\n Pieter van Musschenbroek (14 March 1692 \u2013 19 September 1761) was a Dutch scientist. He was a professor in Duisburg, Utrecht, and Leiden, where he held positions in mathematics, philosophy, medicine, and astronomy. He is credited with the invention of the first capacitor in 1746: the Leyden jar. He performed pioneering work on the buckling of compressed struts.  Musschenbroek was also one of the first scientists (1729) to provide detailed descriptions of testing machines for tension, compression, and flexure testing.[1][2] An early example of a problem in dynamic plasticity was described in the 1739 paper (in the form of the penetration of butter by a wooden stick subjected to impact by a wooden sphere).\n Pieter van Musschenbroek was born on 14 March 1692 in Leiden, Holland, Dutch Republic. His father was Johannes van Musschenbroek and his mother was Margaretha van Straaten. The Van Musschenbroeks, originally from Flanders, had lived in the city of Leiden since circa 1600.[3] His father was an instrument maker, who made scientific instruments such as air pumps, microscopes, and telescopes.[4]\n Van Musschenbroek attended Latin school until 1708, where he studied Greek, Latin, French, English, High German, Italian, and Spanish. He studied medicine at Leiden University and received his doctorate in 1715.[5] He also attended lectures by John Theophilus Desaguliers and Isaac Newton in London. He finished his study in philosophy in 1719.[6]\n Musschenbroek belonged to the tradition of Dutch thinkers who popularised the ontological argument of God's design.[7] He is author of Oratio de sapientia divina (Prayer of Divine Wisdom. 1744).\n In 1719, he became professor of mathematics and philosophy at the University of Duisburg. In 1721, he also became professor of medicine.[6]\n In 1723, he left his posts in Duisburg and became professor at the University of Utrecht. In 1726 he also became professor in astronomy.[8] Musschenbroek's Elementa Physica (1726) played an important part in the transmission of Isaac Newton's ideas in physics to Europe.[6] In November 1734 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.[9]\n In 1739, he returned to Leiden, where he succeeded Jacobus Wittichius[10] as professor.[6]\n Already during his studies at Leiden University Van Musschenbroek became interested in electrostatics. At that time, transient electrical energy could be generated by friction machines but there was no way to store it. Musschenbroek and his student Andreas Cunaeus discovered that the energy could be stored, in work that also involved Jean-Nicolas-S\u00e9bastien Allamand as collaborator.[11] The apparatus was a glass jar filled with water into which a brass rod had been placed; and the stored energy could be released only by completing an external circuit between the brass rod and another conductor, originally a hand, placed in contact with the outside of the jar. Van Musschenbroek communicated this discovery to Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur in January 1746, and it was Abb\u00e9 Nollet, the translator of Musschenbroek's letter from Latin, who named the invention the 'Leyden jar'.[12]\n Soon afterwards, it transpired that a German scientist, Ewald von Kleist, had independently constructed a similar device in late 1745, shortly before Musschenbroek.[13]\n In 1754, he became an honorary professor at the Imperial Academy of Science in Saint Petersburg.[6] He was also elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1747.\n Van Musschenbroek died on 19 September 1761 in Leiden.[6]\n ", "tags": ["1692 births", "1761 deaths", "Dutch inventors", "Dutch scientists", "18th-century Dutch scientists", "Leiden University alumni", "People from Leiden", "Utrecht University faculty", "Leiden University faculty", "Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Honorary Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences", "18th-century Dutch inventors", "CS1: long volume value", "EngvarB from July 2017", "Use dmy dates from July 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BPN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nPieter van Musschenbroek1741 portrait of Pieter van MusschenbroekBorn(1692-03-14)14 March 1692Leiden, Dutch RepublicDied19 September 1761(1761-09-19) (aged\u00a069)Leiden, Dutch RepublicNationalityDutchAlma\u00a0materLeiden UniversityKnown\u00a0forLeyden jar, Tribometer, AtmometerScientific careerFieldsPhysics, mathematics, philosophy, medicine, astronomyDoctoral advisorWolferd Senguerd  Herman BoerhaaveNotable studentsAndreas Cunaeus\n\nPieter van Musschenbroek (14 March 1692 \u2013 19 September 1761) was a Dutch scientist.
