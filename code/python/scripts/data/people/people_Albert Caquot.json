{"name": "Albert Caquot", "content": "Albert Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Caquot (1 July 1881 \u2013 28 November 1976) was considered as the \"best living French engineer\"[1] during half a century. He received the \u201cCroix de Guerre 1914\u20131918 (France)\u201d (military honor) and was Grand-croix of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur (1951). He was a member of the French Academy of Sciences from 1934 till his death. In 1962, he was awarded the Wilhelm Exner Medal.[2]\n His parents, Paul Auguste Ondrine Caquot and wife Marie Irma (born Cousinard)[3] owned a family farm in Vouziers, in the Ardennes, near the Belgian border. His father taught him modernism, by installing at their place electricity and telephone as early as 1890. One year only after high school, at eighteen years old, he was admitted at the Ecole Polytechnique[3] (\"year\" 1899). Six years later, he graduated in the Corps des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es.\n From 1905 to 1912, he was a project manager in Troyes (Aube), and was pointed out for major civil work improvements he undertook with the city sewer system. This protected the city from the centennial flood of the River Seine in 1910. In 1912, he joined a leading structural engineering firm where he applied his unique talent of structure designer.\n Albert Caquot conducted outstanding research that was immediately applied in construction. His major contributions include:\n In the course of his life, Albert Caquot taught mechanical science for a long time in three of the most prominent French engineering schools in Paris: \u00c9coles nationales sup\u00e9rieures des Mines, des Ponts et de l\u2019A\u00e9ronautique.\n In the course of his career, as both a highly creative designer and a tireless calculator, he designed more than 300 bridges and facilities among which several were world records at the time:\n Two prestigious achievements made him famous internationally: the internal structure of the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) at the peak of Corcovado Mountain (1931) and the George V Bridge on the Clyde River in Glasgow (Scotland) for which the Scottish engineers asked for his assistance.\n In his late eighties, he developed a gigantic tidal power project to capture the tide energy in Mont St Michel bay, in Normandy.\n During the course of his life, he committed himself alternatively to structural and aeronautical engineering following the rhythm imposed by the First and Second World Wars. Albert Caquot's contributions to aeronautics are included the design of the \u201cCaquot dirigible\u201d and technical innovations at the new French Aviation Ministry, where he created several Fluid Mechanics Institutes that still exist today. Marcel Dassault, who was charged by Albert Caquot to develop several major aeronautical projects at the beginning of his career, wrote about him: \"He was one of the best engineers that aeronautics ever had. He was visionary and ahead of his time. He led aeronautical innovations for forty years\".\n As early as 1901, already visionary, he performed his military service in an airship unit of the French army. At the beginning of First World War, he was mobilised with the 40e Compagnie d'A\u00e9rostiers equipped with Drachen type airships as first lieutenant. He noticed the poor wind behavior of these sausage shaped captive balloons, which were ineffective except in calm conditions.\n In 1914, he designed a new sausage-shaped dirigible equipped with three air-filled lobes spaced evenly around the tail as stabilizers, and moved the inner air balloonette from the rear to the underside of the nose, separate from the main gas envelope. The Caquot was able to hold in 90\u00a0km/h winds and remain horizontal. During three years, France manufactured \"Caquot dirigibles\" for all the allied forces, including English and United States armies. The United States also manufactured nearly a thousand \"Caquot R balloons\" in 1918-1919. This balloon gave to France and its allies an advantage in military observation which significantly contributed to the allies\u2019 supremacy in aviation and eventually to the final victory. In January 1918, Georges Cl\u00e9menceau named him technical director of the entire military aviation.\nIn 1919, Albert Caquot proposed the creation of the French aeronautical museum (today called Mus\u00e9e de l'Air et de l'Espace, in Le Bourget). This museum is the oldest aeronautical museum in the world.\n In 1928, Albert Caquot became the first executive director of the new Aviation ministry. He implemented a policy of research, prototypes and mass production which contributed quickly to France leadership in the aeronautical industry. His main accomplishments are:\n In 1933, after a budget cut which prevented him from carrying forward his projects, he resigned and went back to structural engineering for several years.\n In 1938, under the threat of the war, Albert Caquot was brought back to manage all the national aeronautical businesses. He resigned in January 1940.\n He always had a great independence of mind and an incredible selflessness. The numerous honors he received from multiple countries, for example the dignity of Grand-croix de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur in France (1951), pay tribute to his exceptional merits. He was a member of the French Academy of Sciences for 41 years and served as their president from 1952 to 1961. During more than twenty years, he chaired numerous French scientific organizations, like the National Council of the French Engineers (CNISF), and was on the board of EDF (\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France), the main electricity generation and distribution company in France, during more than ten years. In 1961, at 80 years old, Albert Caquot resigned from all the presidencies which he had always assured voluntarily. Warm-hearted, attentive and available, he loved to withdraw within his family.\n On 2 July 2001, a 4.5-FRF (0.69-\u20ac) stamp was issued in France to celebrate Albert Caquot's legacy on the 120th anniversary of his birth and the 25th anniversary of his death. A \u201cCaquot dirigeable\" and the bridge of La Caille, two of his creations, surround his picture on the stamp.\n Since 1989, the Prix Albert Caquot is awarded annually by the French Association of Civil and Structural Engineering.\n ", "tags": ["1881 births", "1976 deaths", "French bridge engineers", "Corps des ponts", "\u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech alumni", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni", "\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France people", "French aerospace engineers", "French civil engineers", "Geotechnical engineers", "Grand Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Officers of the French Academy of Sciences", "People from Vouziers", "Recipients of the Croix de Guerre 1914\u20131918 (France)", "Structural engineers", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles needing additional references from November 2009", "All articles needing additional references", "Wikipedia articles with style issues from April 2014", "All articles with style issues", "Articles with multiple maintenance issues", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article has multiple issues.

This protected the city from the centennial flood of the River Seine in 1910. In 1912, he joined a leading structural engineering firm where he applied his unique talent of structure designer.\nAlbert Caquot conducted outstanding research that was immediately applied in construction. His major contributions include:\n\nreinforced concrete design, and structural engineering in a broader sense. In 1930, he defined the intrinsic curve and explained why the elasticity theory was not sufficient any more for modern structures design.\ngeotechnics and foundation design. He stated the corresponding states theorem (CST). In 1933, his publication on the stability of pulverulent and coherent material received an admiring report from the French Academy of Sciences, where he was elected life member in 1934. In 1948, with Jean K\u00e9risel (1908\u20132005), his son-in-law and disciple, he developed an advanced theory extremely important for passive earth pressure (LINK) where there is soil-wall friction. This principle has been broadly applied ever since for the design of ground engineering structures such as retaining walls, tunnels and foundation piles.\nthe revival of cable-stayed bridges with reinforced concrete (Donz\u00e8re Mondragon bridge, 1952), which he envisioned with long spans, even crossing the English Channel. In 1967, he designed a conceptual double-deck bridge of this type with 810 m-wide spans and two 25 m-wide decks stages accommodating 8 lanes for cars, 2 for rail and 2 for skytrain.\n The new La Caille bridge near Annecy, 1928.\nIn the course of his life, Albert Caquot taught mechanical science for a long time in three of the most prominent French engineering schools in Paris: \u00c9coles nationales sup\u00e9rieures des Mines, des Ponts et de l\u2019A\u00e9ronautique.\nIn the course of his career, as both a highly creative designer and a tireless calculator, he designed more than 300 bridges and facilities among which several were world records at the time:\n\nthe La Madeleine Bridge, in Nantes (1928), a concrete cantilever bridge over the River Loire,\nthe Lafayette Bridge crossing the tracks of the Gare de l\u2019Est in Paris (1928). This is a struss bridge in reinforced concrete, where concrete vibrators using compressed air were used for the first time in history,\nthe new La Caille Bridge (1928), on the ravine of Usses, in the Alps, close to Annecy. This is a 140-m-span concrete arc bridge,\nthe great Louis Joubert dry dock (Normandie-Dock) in the port of Saint-Nazaire (1929\u201333),\n Dam of La Girotte (Alps, France), 1949.\nthe La Girotte Dam (1944\u201349),\nthe Boll\u00e8ne lock, on the left side (navigating downwards) of the Donz\u00e8re-Mondragon Dam (built on the Donz\u00e8re-Mondragon Canal, lateral to the Rh\u00f4ne river), the world's tallest lock (1950),\nthe Bildstock tunnel (1953\u20131955),\nthe world's largest tidal power plant on the River Rance, in Brittany (1961\u20131966). In his eighties, Albert Caquot made a critical contribution to the construction of the dam, designing an enclosure in order to protect the construction site from the 12-m-high ocean tides and the strong streams.\n Christ the Redeemer, Rio de Janeiro, the internal structure was built by Caquot, 1931\nTwo prestigious achievements made him famous internationally: the internal structure of the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) at the peak of Corcovado Mountain (1931) and the George V Bridge on the Clyde River in Glasgow (Scotland) for which the Scottish engineers asked for his assistance.\nIn his late eighties, he developed a gigantic tidal power project to capture the tide energy in Mont St Michel bay, in Normandy.\n\nThe aeronautical engineer[edit]\nDuring the course of his life, he committed himself alternatively to structural and aeronautical engineering following the rhythm imposed by the First and Second World Wars.

The school still exists today.\nthe construction of the gigantic Chalais-Meudon Wind Tunnel in 1929[4] (120 m-long and 25 m-high) allowing to test an aircraft in real conditions, with engine running and the pilot on board.[5] This wind tunnel was the largest of the world at the time and it was used to test the Dassault Mirage III, the Sud Aviation Caravelle and the Concorde, but also cars like the Peugeot 4 CV and the VW Beetle.\nIn 1933, after a budget cut which prevented him from carrying forward his projects, he resigned and went back to structural engineering for several years.\nIn 1938, under the threat of the war, Albert Caquot was brought back to manage all the national aeronautical businesses.
