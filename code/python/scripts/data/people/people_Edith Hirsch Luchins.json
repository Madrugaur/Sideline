{"name": "Edith Hirsch Luchins", "content": "Edith Hirsch Luchins (21 December 1921 Brzeziny, Poland \u2013 18 November 2002 Suffern, New York) was a Polish-American mathematician. Her work focused on applying mathematical principles to problems in the philosophy of science and psychology, most notably in the field of Gestalt psychology.[1] The Luchins and Luchins' Water Jar Experiment is named after her and psychologist Abraham S. Luchins.\n Edith Hirsch was born in 1921 in Poland. She emigrated to the United States at age six, settling with her family in New York City. In high school Hirsch excelled at mathematics, tutoring other students and assisting teachers with grading.  She earned her B.A from Brooklyn College in 1942 and her M.A. from NYU in 1944.[2]  She obtained her Ph.D. from University of Oregon in 1957 with her dissertation \"On Some Properties of Certain Banach Algebras.\"[3]\n From 1942 to 1943, Luchins worked for the government as an inspector of anti-aircraft equipment at Sperry Gyroscope during World War II. Luchins began her doctoral studies at NYU under Kurt Friedrichs and Richard Courant as she began her teaching career at Brooklyn College. She put her formal studies on hold for several years for personal reasons; however, she continued to conduct research and publish papers in educational mathematics alongside her academic husband.\n After obtaining her doctorate in 1957, Luchins again pursued teaching, teaching for four years at the University of Miami before being appointed as an associate professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic in 1962. In 1970, she became the first female full professor at Rensselaer, where she remained until her retirement in 1992.
