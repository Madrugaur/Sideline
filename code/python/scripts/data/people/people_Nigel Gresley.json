{"name": "Nigel Gresley", "content": "\n Sir Herbert Nigel Gresley CBE (19 June 1876 \u2013 5 April 1941)[1] was a British railway engineer. He was one of Britain's most famous steam locomotive engineers, who rose to become Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). He was the designer of some of the most famous steam locomotives in Britain, including the LNER Class A1 and LNER Class A4 4-6-2 Pacific engines. An A1 Pacific, Flying Scotsman, was the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100\u00a0mph in passenger service, and an A4, number 4468 Mallard, still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world (126\u00a0mph).\n Gresley's engines were considered elegant, both aesthetically and mechanically. His invention of a three-cylinder design with only two sets of Walschaerts valve gear, the Gresley conjugated valve gear, produced smooth running and power at lower cost than would have been achieved with a more conventional three sets of Walschaerts gear.\n Gresley was born in Edinburgh during his mother's visit there to see a gynaecologist,[2] but was raised in Netherseal, Derbyshire, a member of a cadet branch of a family long seated at Gresley, Derbyshire. After attending school in Sussex and at Marlborough College, Gresley served his apprenticeship at the Crewe works of the London and North Western Railway, afterwards becoming a pupil under John Aspinall at Horwich of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR). After several minor appointments with the L&YR he was made Outdoor Assistant in the Carriage and Wagon Department in 1901; in 1902 he was appointed Assistant Works Manager at Newton Heath depot, and Works Manager the following year.\n This rapid rise in his career was maintained, for he became Assistant Superintendent of the Carriage and Wagon Department of the L&YR in 1904. A year later, he moved to the Great Northern Railway (GNR) as Carriage and Wagon Superintendent. He succeeded Henry A. Ivatt as CME of the GNR on 1 October 1911. At the 1923 Grouping, he was appointed CME of the newly formed LNER (the post had originally been offered to the ageing John G. Robinson; Robinson declined and suggested the much younger Gresley). In 1936, Gresley was awarded an honorary DSc by Manchester University and a knighthood by King Edward VIII;[3] also in that year he presided over the IMechE.\n During the 1930s, Sir Nigel Gresley lived at Salisbury Hall, near St. Albans in Hertfordshire. Gresley developed an interest in breeding wild birds and ducks in the moat; intriguingly, among the species were Mallard ducks.[4] The Hall still exists today as a private residence and is adjacent to the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre, with its links to the design of the famous Mosquito aircraft during World War II.\n In 1936, Gresley designed the 1,500 V DC locomotives for the proposed electrification of the Woodhead Line between Manchester and Sheffield. The Second World War forced the postponement of the project, which was completed in the early 1950s. Edgar Claxton was Gresley's assistant throughout this project, working on power supply, equipment and systems, besides carrying out the trials.[5]\n Gresley was appointed CBE in 1920[6] and was knighted in the 1936 Birthday Honours.\n Gresley died on 5 April 1941, after a short illness, and was buried in St Peter's Church, Netherseal, Derbyshire.\n He was succeeded as the LNER CME by Edward Thompson.\n A memorial plaque to Gresley's achievements was unveiled at Edinburgh Waverley railway station in 2001. It was created by the Gresley Society and incorporates line drawings of his Flying Scotsman and Mallard locomotives.\n Following the redevelopment of the site previously home to Doncaster College, the square outside the new Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council Offices and Cast Theatre was named Sir Nigel Gresley Square, in honour of the designer of some of the most famous steam locomotives built at Doncaster Plant Works following a public poll of Doncaster residents hosted by the Doncaster Free Press. Sir Nigel Gresley Square was opened to the public as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, by the Mayor of Doncaster Mr. Peter Davies and two of Nigel Gresley's grandsons, in May 2012.\n LNER Class A4 4498 Sir Nigel Gresley is named after its designer.\n A statue of Gresley was unveiled at King's Cross station in London on 5 April 2016, the 75th anniversary of his death.[7] Sculptor Hazel Reeves originally included a duck alongside Gresley in reference to his hobby of breeding water fowl and his bird-themed locomotive names such as Mallard, but this was removed from the final design when two of Gresley's grandsons complained it was \"demeaning\".[8]\n See: Locomotives of the Great Northern Railway\n See: Locomotives of the London and North Eastern Railway\n ", "tags": ["English mechanical engineers", "1876 births", "1941 deaths", "Knights Bachelor", "Commanders of the Order of the British Empire", "Locomotive builders and designers", "People educated at Marlborough College", "People from Leicestershire (before 1897)", "Burials in Derbyshire", "English railway mechanical engineers", "Great Northern Railway (Great Britain) people", "London and North Eastern Railway people", "Hadley Wood", "People from Watton-at-Stone", "20th-century British engineers", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "EngvarB from August 2014", "Use dmy dates from August 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with CWGC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "British engineer\nFor the canal builder, see Sir Nigel Gresley, 6th Baronet.
