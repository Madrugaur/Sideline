{"name": "Beppo Levi", "content": "Beppo Levi (14 May 1875 \u2013 28 August 1961) was an Italian mathematician. He published high-level academic articles and books, not only on mathematics, but also on physics, history, philosophy, and pedagogy. Levi was a member of the Bologna Academy of Sciences and of the Accademia dei Lincei.\n Beppo Levi was born on May 14, 1875, in Turin, Italy, and he was an older brother of Eugenio Elia Levi.[1]  He obtained his laurea in mathematics in 1896 at age 21 from the University of Turin under Corrado Segre.[1][2] He was appointed an Assistant Professor at the University of Turin three months later and shortly thereafter became a full-time Scholar.[1] Levi was appointed Professor at the University of Piacenza in 1901, at the University of Cagliari in 1906, at the University of Parma in 1910, and finally at the University of Bologna in 1928.[3] The years that followed his last appointment saw the rise of  Benito Mussolini's power and of  antisemitism in Italy, and Levi, being Jewish, was soon expelled from his  position at the University of Bologna.[3] He emigrated to Argentina, as did many other European Jews at that time.\n Levi chose Argentina because of an invitation by the engineer Cort\u00e9s Pl\u00e1, dean of the Facultad de Ciencias Matem\u00e1ticas, F\u00edsico-Qu\u00edmicas y Naturales Aplicadas a la Industria at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral (currently Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Ingenier\u00eda y Agrimensura at the Universidad Nacional de Rosario) in the city of Rosario. Cort\u00e9s Pl\u00e1 invited Levi to come to Rosario to head the recently created Instituto de Matem\u00e1tica. It was there that Levi did most of his work from 1939 until his death in 1961.\n While living in Rosario, Levi joined a group of mathematicians  that included Luis Santal\u00f3, Sim\u00f3n Rubinstein, Juan Olgu\u00edn, Enrique Ferrari, Fernando and Enrique Gaspar, Mario Castagnino and Edmundo Rofman. In 1940 Levi founded Mathematicae Notae, the first mathematical journal in Argentina.[4]  In 1956 he was awarded the Feltrinelli Prize.[4]\n He died on August 28, 1961 in Rosario, Argentina, and was buried in the Jewish cemetery there.[4]\n His early work studied singularities on algebraic curves and surfaces.[5]  In particular, he supplied a proof (questioned by some) that a procedure for resolution of singularities on algebraic surfaces terminates in finitely many steps.[5]  Later he proved some foundational results concerning Lebesgue integration, including what is commonly known as Beppo Levi's lemma.[6]\n He also studied the arithmetic of elliptic curves.  He classified them up to isomorphism, not only over C, but also over Q.  Next he studied what in modern terminology would be the subgroup of rational torsion points on an elliptic curve over Q: he proved that certain groups were realizable and that others were not.  He essentially formulated the torsion conjecture for elliptic curves over the rational numbers, providing a complete list of possibilities should be, which was formulated independently by Andrew Ogg about 60 years later and finally proved by Barry Mazur in 1973.[7]\n  Media related to Beppo Levi at Wikimedia Commons\n ", "tags": ["1875 births", "1961 deaths", "Scientists from Turin", "People from Rosario, Santa Fe", "Argentine Jews", "Argentine mathematicians", "19th-century Italian mathematicians", "20th-century Italian mathematicians", "20th-century Italian Jews", "Italian emigrants to Argentina", "Jewish scientists", "Italian Sephardi Jews", "University of Turin alumni", "University of Turin faculty", "Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore faculty", "University of Cagliari faculty", "University of Parma faculty", "University of Bologna faculty", "National University of Rosario faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 Italian-language sources (it)", "CS1: long volume value", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Italian mathematician\nBeppo LeviBorn(1875-05-14)May 14, 1875Turin, ItalyDiedAugust 28, 1961(1961-08-28) (aged\u00a086)Rosario, ArgentinaAlma\u00a0materUniversity of TurinKnown\u00a0for\nBeppo Levi's lemma\nResolution of singularities\nTorsion conjecture\nAwards\nFeltrinelli Prize (1956)\nMember of the Bologna Academy of Sciences\nMember of the Accademia dei Lincei\nScientific careerFields\nAlgebraic geometry\nDiophantine geometry\nLebesgue integration\nInstitutions\nUniversidad Nacional de Rosario\nUniversity of Bologna\nUniversity of Parma\nUniversity of Cagliari\nUniversit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore\nUniversity of Turin\nDoctoral advisorCorrado Segre\n\n Dedication at the Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Superior in Rosario, Argentina Tombstone, Rosario's Jewish Cemetery\nBeppo Levi (14 May 1875 \u2013 28 August 1961) was an Italian mathematician.
