{"name": "Jozef Murga\u0161", "content": "Jozef Murga\u0161 (English Joseph Murgas) (17 February 1864 \u2013 11 May 1929) was a Slovak inventor, architect, botanist, painter and Roman Catholic priest. He contributed to wireless telegraphy and helped in the development of mobile communications and the wireless transmission of information and the human voice.\n Murga\u0161 was nicknamed the Radio Priest and deemed a Renaissance man.[by whom?]\n Murga\u0161 was born in Tajov (Taj\u00f3), Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire (now Slovakia). He studied theology in Pre\u0161porok (Pressburg, present Bratislava) (1880\u201382), Esztergom (Ostrihom) (1882\u201384) and in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, where he graduated in 1888. From his youth he was bright, skillful and good at painting and electrotechnology. The vice-head of the school in Esztergom allowed him to use the physics room for experiments and the Slovak painters B. Klemens and Dominik Skuteck\u00fd noticed his talent for painting.\n After priestly ordination in 1888, Murga\u0161 worked as a curate. On Skuteck\u00fd's initiative, Murga\u0161 was accepted at a painting school in Budapest, where he studied from 1889\u201390. He also studied painting in Munich from 1890\u201393. He attended both schools while working. He painted sacral pieces, Slovak landscapes and Slovak personalities. It was due to his strong patriotism he exhibited during holidays in the 1890s that he was not allowed to finish his painting studies and had to work as a curate in changing places in the Kingdom of Hungary: in Chrenovec (Nyitratorm\u00e1s), Slovensk\u00e1 \u013dup\u010da (Z\u00f3lyomlipcse), Dubov\u00e1 (Cseres) and in Lopej (Lop\u00e9r). In Lopej, he painted a large sacral picture of St. George which is still on the church altar of the village. The central altar painting of St. Elisabeth in the 14th century Church of St. Elizabeth in the main square of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica was by Murga\u0161.\n Due to permanent conflicts with the bishop's secretary, Murga\u0161 had to emigrate to the United States in 1896, where he was assigned a Slovak parish in the city of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Having no possibility for painting, he started to deal with natural sciences again, especially electrotechnology. He established a laboratory in Wilkes-Barre, in which he primarily investigated radiotelegraphy. His article in the Tovary\u0161stvo magazine of 1900 shows that his radiotelegraphy studies had achieved a high level. In 1904, he received his first two US patents: the Apparatus for wireless telegraphy and The way of transmitted messages by wireless telegraphy. Further 15 patents followed between 1907 and 1916 (see below). Based on the first two patents, he created the Universal Aether Telegraph Co., which organized a public test of Murga\u0161's transmitting and receiving facilities in September 1905 (see below). The test was successful, but a storm destroyed the antenna masts three month later, which led to a dissolution of the company.\n Murga\u0161's primary concern in Wilkes-Barre, however, were the local Slovaks. He took care of Slovak immigrants, had a new church, library, cemetery, several schools, gymnasium and playgrounds built, all of which are still used by American Slovaks. He was also one of the founders of the Saints Cyril and Methodius community and took care of children and youth. He was very popular among religious people because of his emotional relation to them. He also published a newspaper, in which he published some popular science articles and verses.\n Murga\u0161 was active in the Slovak expatriates movement, wrote articles for their press, was one of the founders of the Slovak League in America, actively supported the creation of the state of Czechoslovakia, organized a money collection (a fund) of American Slovaks for the creation of Czechoslovakia (US$1,000,000) and was also a writer and a signatory of the Pittsburgh Agreement (1918) between Czechs and Slovaks on establishing Czechoslovakia. As a respected personality, he gained the trust and support of the highest authorities in the US for the establishment of Czechoslovakia.\n Murga\u0161 continued to study physics and to do many experiments. He financed his activities by selling his paintings. He also collected mushrooms, plants, minerals and insects. His butterfly collection comprised 9000 pieces from all over the world.\n When the United States entered World War I, private radiotelegraphy stations were prohibited which put an end to Murga\u0161's pioneer work in this field. After the creation of Czechoslovakia, he returned to Slovakia in 1920, where he taught electrotechnology at a high school but since he did not find appropriate understanding by the Ministry of Education in Prague, he returned to Wilkes-Barre four months later. He was nominated to be a member of the Federal Radio Commission of the United States in 1925. Murga\u0161 died in Wilkes-Barre four years later.\n The most dynamic segments in the area of communication services today are internet services, mobile telephony and convergence of voice and data process. If we go back one hundred years to history we can see that development in this area began with wireless information transmission encoded in telegraphy marks and wireless voice transmission which was made by frequency modulation.\n In 1905, Murga\u0161 achieved radio transmission between Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, Pennsylvania, or a distance of 20 miles (30\u00a0km).\n The tone system is the use of two signals of different frequencies, i.e. Murga\u0161 substituted the \"dot\" of the Morse code with a higher tone and the \"dash\" with a lower tone (this is the 1904 patent \"The way of transmitted messages by wireless telegraphy\").\n Thomas Edison paid remarkable attention to Murga\u0161's experiments and he is said to have informed Guglielmo Marconi of Murga\u0161's success. Murga\u0161's lab in Wilkes-Barre was visited by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905.\n In Tajov, there is Murga\u0161's house where he was born, a memorial room and a symbolic grave with a sepulchral monument of Murga\u0161 at the local cemetery. Jozef \u0160ebo, the founder of the room and monument (now a retired teacher) looks after them very carefully. The memorial room also features originals of pictures, paintings, some unique pieces from his  butterfly collection, models of inventions in wireless telegraphy and documents. One can also see there a minimodel of Murga\u0161's original antenna masts built by company Universal Aether Telegraph Co. in Wilkes-Barre in 1905.\n Further objects include: \n To the memory of Murga\u0161 and to support the development of telecommunications in Slovakia, the Jozef Murga\u0161 Award is awarded annually by the Slovak Electrotechnical Society and Ministry of Transport, Posts and Telecommunications of the Slovak Republic for:\n ", "tags": ["1864 births", "1929 deaths", "People from Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica District", "Slovak Roman Catholic priests", "Austro-Hungarian emigrants to the United States", "Hungarian emigrants to the United States", "People from the Kingdom of Hungary", "American people of Slovak descent", "People from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania", "Radio pioneers", "Catholic clergy scientists", "Slovak inventors", "Slovak scientists", "Articles needing additional references from January 2021", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from August 2018", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.
