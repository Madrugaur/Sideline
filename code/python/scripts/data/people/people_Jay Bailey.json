Bailey Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Field of Biological Engineering,[3] by the AIChE Society for Biological Engineering.\n Bailey was the only child of Jim and Doris Bailey, growing up in Rockford, Illinois.[4] He studied chemical engineering at Rice University receiving a BA in 1966 and PhD in 1969 working with Fritz Horn.
