Between 1911 and 1919 he was a professor at the Franz Joseph University in Kolozsv\u00e1r, Austria-Hungary.  The post-WW1 Treaty of Trianon transferred former Austro-Hungarian territory including Kolozsv\u00e1r to the Kingdom of Romania, whereupon Kolozsv\u00e1r's name changed to Cluj and the University of Kolozsv\u00e1r moved to Szeged, Hungary, becoming the University of Szeged.[4]  Then, Riesz was the rector and a professor at the University of Szeged, as well as a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.[5] and the Polish Academy of Learning. He was the older brother of the mathematician Marcel Riesz.\n Riesz did some of the fundamental work in developing functional analysis and his work has had a number of important applications in physics. He established the spectral theory for bounded symmetric operators in a form very much like that now regarded as standard.[2]  He also made many contributions to other areas including ergodic theory, topology[6] and he gave an elementary proof of the mean ergodic theorem.\n Riesz founded the Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum journal together with Alfr\u00e9d Haar.\n He had an uncommon method of giving lectures: he entered the lecture hall with an assistant and a docent. The docent then began reading the proper passages from Riesz's handbook and the assistant wrote the appropriate equations on the blackboard\u2014while Riesz himself stood aside, nodding occasionally.[7]\n The Swiss-American mathematician Edgar Lorch spent 1934 in Szeged working under Riesz and wrote a reminiscence about his time there, including his collaboration with Riesz.[4]\n ", "tags": ["1880 births", "1956 deaths", "University of Szeged faculty", "19th-century mathematicians", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "Mathematical analysts", "Functional analysts", "Operator theorists", "Mathematicians from Budapest", "Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "Burials at Kerepesi Cemetery", "Franz Joseph University faculty", "Rectors of the Franz Joseph University", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Articles containing Hungarian-language text", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Frigyes RieszBorn(1880-01-22)22 January 1880Gy\u0151r, Austria-HungaryDied28 February 1956(1956-02-28) (aged\u00a076)Budapest, HungaryCitizenshipHungarianKnown\u00a0forfunctional analysisintegral equationsergodic theoryRiesz representation theoremRiesz\u2013Fischer theoremRiesz spaceHardy spaceLp spaceRiesz's lemmaRadon\u2013Riesz propertyproximity spaceF. and M.
