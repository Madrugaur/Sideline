{"name": "Adolf Cluss", "content": "Calvary Baptist Church\nCharles Sumner School\nEastern Market\nCenter Market\nFranklin School\n Adolf Ludwig Cluss (July 14, 1825 \u2013 July 24, 1905) also known as Adolph Cluss was a German-born American immigrant who became one of the most important, influential and prolific architects in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century, responsible for the design of numerous schools and other notable public buildings in the capital. Today, several of his buildings are still standing. He was also a City Engineer and a Building Inspector for the Board of Public Works. \n Red brick was Cluss' favorite building material; that, and his early communist sympathies, led some to dub him the \"Red Architect\", though he was a man who in later life became a confirmed Republican.[1]\n He was born on July 24, 1825, in Heilbronn in the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg in Southwest Germany. He was the fifth child of Johann Heinrich Abraham Cluss (1792-1857) and Anna Christine Neuz (1796-1827).[2] His father was a master builder, and young Cluss set out as an itinerant carpenter when he left Heilbronn at age nineteen. In his travels, he met and became a friend of Karl Marx and a supporter of communist principles at a time of political and revolutionary ferment in Germany. He joined the Communist League and became a member of the Mainz Worker Council. The failure of the German revolutionary movement in 1848 led him to leave Germany when he was twenty-three, along with other Forty-Eighters who emigrated to the United States at that time. In the United States, he continued his political activity into the 1850s, maintaining an extensive correspondence with Marx and Engels and writing and publishing political articles for the German-American community.[3]\n Adolf Cluss immigrated to the United-States in 1848 at the age of 23. He crossed the Atlantic on board the Z\u00fcrich, a small sailing ship from Le Havre, France to New York City.[4] He spent the first six months in New York City where he perfected his English. He looked for work in Philadelphia, Baltimore and finally settled in Washington, D.C., in the 1849. In the summer of 1849, he started working for the U.S. Coast Survey as a technical draftsman surveying the Maryland and Virginia coastlines. The following year, we worked at the Washington Navy Yard designing various project for the Ordnance Department. He did not like this position or his life in the city and considered going back to Europe. He considered becoming a bookseller in 1852, requesting funds from his father who did not provide the funds. In 1855, he became a US citizen[5] and transferred to the US Treasury Department as a technical draftsman.[6] He became an abolitionist sometime after that time.[5]\n He briefly returned to Europe in 1859 to receive his share of the inheritance this father had left him when he died in 1857 and returned to Philadelphia. He attempted to become a brewer with a friend but the business soon failed and we was back to his old position in the Ordnance Department at the Washington Navy Yard working closely with Admiral John A. Dahlgren.[6]\n Adolf Cluss started his private practice in 1862. While America was torn apart in the Civil War and while still working at the Navy Yard, Cluss started an architectural office with another German immigrant Josef Wildrich von Kammerhueber. He continued to work full-time at the Navy Yard until the following year and part-time as an architect. His partner was working full-time from Cluss' house on 2nd Street, NW. In 1864, their breakthrough was the Wallach School. Adolf Cluss was 39 years old.[6]\n Cluss and Kammerhueber were also civil engineers as many architects at the time. In 1864, the City of Washington requested Cluss and Kammerhueber to write a report on the Washington City Canal and the sewer system. This report led to the Canal being finally covered over in 1871 which had become an open sewer on the National Mall.[7] The partnership ended in 1868.[6] He became an active member of the American Institute of Architects in 1867.[8]\n Cluss maintained his solo private practice but became a Building Inspector for the Board of Public Works in Washington, DC. The Board was the most powerful entity in the city. Cluss wrote building regulations and was a major proponent of the use of building permits and inspections.[7] On October 18, 1872, he was appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant as a member of the Board of Public Works and City Engineer. This came at the recommendation of Governor Cooke, Alexander \"Boss\" Shepherd and his predecessor Alfred B. Mullett.[9]\n I most earnestly recommend the appointment of Adolph Cluss Esq. to fill the vacancy on the Board of Public Works, caused by my resignation. He is a competent architect and engineer and an earnest and sincere republican, and in my opinion a gentleman of the very highest integrity. I know of no person in the District of Columbia whose appointment would in my opinion give more general satisfaction or who is more competent. Mr. Cluss' appointment would, I think, be highly appreciated by the german republicans of this city.[10] Cluss had been become a member of the local Republican party by then and had led a volunteer committee of local Republicans coordinating parts of the President's inauguration after having been re-elected that same year.[11] He also volunteered in President James A. Garfield's inauguration committee in 1880.[12]\n The Board had been working to improve the city by paving and grading roads, adding sewers and planting trees but there was a cost associated with this. The expenditures by the Board of Public Works lead the city to be on the brink of bankruptcy. Adolf Cluss testified before a Joint Committee in May 1874. His appointment was revoked by the President on May 25, 1874.[13][14] Congress to pass legislation on June 30, 1874, abolishing the territorial government and replacing it with the three-member Board of Commissioners.\n In 1877, he partnered with architect Frederick Daniel with an office at 701 15th Street, NW[15] but the partnership came to an end in 1878. The following year, he started working with architect Paul Schulze. The partnership came to an end in 1889 when Cluss retired from his private practice having built almost 90 buildings including at least eleven schools, as well as markets, government buildings, museums, residences and churches.[6] Cluss' schoolhouse designs were particularly innovative and influential, though only two of his red-brick school masterpieces remain, Franklin School and Sumner School in downtown Washington. The Franklin School was completed in 1869 earning the Washington public school system a Medal for Progress.[16]  He designed four major buildings on the National Mall, including the still-standing Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building. He built six houses of worship including Calvary Baptist Church which still stands.\n Two of the city's largest food markets, Center Market (1872) and Eastern Market (1873), were built to his design. The first was torn down in 1931 to be replaced by the National Archives Building. The second is still standing having surviving a fire in 2007. His flagship store for Lansburgh's opened in 1882.[17]\n Cluss was also active as a builder of mansions for the Washington elite, such as Stewart's Castle on Dupont Circle. In 1880, he was hired to create what became Washington's first apartment building, Portland Flats, an ornate, six-floor, 39-unit creation on the south side of Thomas Circle. Almost all of Cluss' residential creations have been demolished\u2014Portland Flats, for instance, was torn down in 1962 to make way for an office building.[18]\n In 1877, he was commission to oversee the reconstruction of the Old Patent Office Building (today the National Portrait Gallery) in Washington, D.C.[19]\n Adolf Cluss was an active member of the American Institute of Architects. He became a fellow of the Institute in 1876.\n He also attended several conventions over the years:\n He was one of the founding members of the Washington, D.C., chapter in 1887. He attended Annual Meetings of the Washington Chapter including the January 7, 1898, meeting.[26]\n In 1889, he was elected for one year as a member of the Board of Directors of the American Institute of Architects.[27][28]\n He became an Inspector of Federal Buildings in the Office of the Supervising Architect under the United States Department of the Treasury[29] in 1889[30] after closing his private office in June of that year.[31] He inspected the Ellis Island buildings in February 1892[32] and wrote a report on July 15, 1892, a few months after the first Immigration Station opened. He testified in front of the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization on how the humidity was a concern in the building only a few months after it was built.[33] He also inspected many other buildings around the country including the Post Office designed by Alfred B. Mullet in Chicago.[34]\n On September 1, 1894, a few months after the death of his wife and after the victory by the Democrats, he was asked for his resignation by Secretary of the Treasury John G. Carlisle.[35] He had solicited letters of support from several prominent people but was replaced by a Democrat.[36]\n On February 8, 1859, he married Rosa Schmidt (1835-1894) at Zion Lutheran Church in Baltimore, Maryland.[37][38][39] They lived in a row house at 413 2nd Street, NW between D Street, NW and E Street, NW[15][30] for thirty-five years. They raised seven children in that house.[39]\n His wife died on April 10, 1894[44] a year after her son Robert of a lengthy respiratory illness. Following the death of Robert, Carl and Rosa Schmidt, Flora and Anita moved to their sister Lillian's house.[39]\n As published in the Evening Star on March 18, 1897, Cluss was on the Delinquent District of Columbia Real Estate Tax List owing $8.41 as of July 1, 1896.[45]\n In the spring and summer of 1898, Cluss traveled to Germany, Italy and Central Europe and visited his older sister's (Caroline De Millas n\u00e9e Cluss) family in Heidelberg, Germany.[46]\n Adolf Cluss died on July 24, 1905, in Washington, D.C., at the age of 80 years. He is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery (Plot: Van Ness, Lot 161 East).[39][47]\n Today, several buildings designed and built by Adolf Cluss still stand in the Washington, D.C., area:\n In 2005, after a ceremonial resolution by the DC Council,[54] DC Mayor Anthony A. Williams made a proclamation that 2005 would be \"Adolf Cluss Year\" from July 2005 to June 2006. Joint exhibitions would be presented in Washington, D.C., at the Charles Sumner School Museum and at the Stadtarchiv in his birthplace of Heilbronn, Germany.[55] Both exhibits closed but a website remains: Adolf-Cluss.org\n A small street in Washington, D.C., was named in his honor: Adolf Cluss Court. It connects C St SE to D St SE between 12th Street SE and 13th St SE. 38\u00b053\u203205.1\u2033N 76\u00b059\u203221.3\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.884750\u00b0N 76.989250\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.884750; -76.989250[56]\n A bridge is named in his honor in his birthplace of Heilbronn, Germany over the Neckar river, at 49\u00b008\u203237.2\u2033N 9\u00b012\u203259.3\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff49.143667\u00b0N 9.216472\u00b0E\ufeff / 49.143667; 9.216472.[57]\n A descriptive list of Cluss's known buildings and an interactive map showing their locations can be found here.[58]\n While Adolf Cluss designed and built close to 90 different buildings in his career, few survive today. In green are the buildings still standing today.\n All the buildings were two stories high and the 7th Street Wing and the 9th Street Wing were both flanked with two towers and a metal awning over the main entrances. Another metal awning ran the entire length of B Street NW and 9th Street NW. These protected shoppers visiting the outdoors stalls. For a small fee, street dealers could place their stands outside, under the market canopy.\n Adolf Cluss took some projects as a builder (general contractor) designed by other architects.\n ", "tags": ["1825 births", "1905 deaths", "American communists", "German-American Forty-Eighters", "19th-century German architects", "German communists", "Architects from Washington, D.C.", "People of Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War", "19th-century American architects", "People from Heilbronn", "Washington, D.C.

Due to the Civil War, iron and lumber were in shortage leading to a slower progress in construction and doubling the cost of construction. This was an auditorium church which had become popular among Protestant churches after 1850. This allowed for good acoustics, a space for organs and choirs along with unobstructed view of the altar. It was two-stories high to fully utilize the space. The Sanctuary was on second floor while the ground floor had Bible Study rooms and Sunday School classrooms. A similar model can be seen in his other churches: Calvary Baptist Church, St. Stephen's Roman Catholic Church, and Chapel of St. Paul. With the area becoming more commercial, the congregation sold the building in 1902 to move to their new church on 16th and P S NW and it was demolished the same year.[59]\n\n\n\n\nCalvary Baptist Church[9]\n\nConstruction: 1865-66\n\n777 8th Street, NW Washington, DC38\u00b053\u203258.7\u2033N 77\u00b001\u203221.8\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.899639\u00b0N 77.022722\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.899639; -77.022722\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaint Stephen Martyr Catholic Church[9]\n\nConstruction: 1866-68Demolished: 1959\n\n2436 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC38\u00b054\u203211.8\u2033N 77\u00b003\u203210.8\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.903278\u00b0N 77.053000\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.903278; -77.053000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTabernacle Church\n\nConstruction: 1881-82 Demolished: 1959\n\n202 9th St SW (9th St & B St, SW) Washington, DC38\u00b053\u203214.6\u2033N 77\u00b001\u203225.4\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.887389\u00b0N 77.023722\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.887389; -77.023722\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversalist Church of Our Father\n\nConstruction: 1882 Demolished: 1973\n\nSoutheast corner of 13th & L St, NW Washington, DC38\u00b054\u203213.0\u2033N 77\u00b001\u203245.9\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.903611\u00b0N 77.029417\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.903611; -77.029417\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapel of Saint Paul\n\nConstruction: 1886 Demolished: 1950\n\n1419 V St NW Washington, DC38\u00b055\u203205.8\u2033N 77\u00b002\u203203.3\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.918278\u00b0N 77.034250\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.918278; -77.034250\n\nToday it is occupied by St Augustine's Church.\n\n\n\nMarkets[edit]\n\n\nName\n\nDates\n\nLocation / GPS\n\nDescription\n\nPicture\n\n\nCenter Market (1864)[9]\n\nPartial Construction: 1864 Demolished: 1865\n\nPennsylvania Avenue between 7th and 9th Streets, NW Washington, DC38\u00b053\u203235.1\u2033N 77\u00b001\u203222.7\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.893083\u00b0N 77.022972\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.893083; -77.022972\n\nIn 1863, Mayor Richard Wallach had Adolf Cluss and Joseph Wildrich von Kammerhueber design a brick structure on B Street NW (Constitution Avenue). A two-story building was designed and construction started. By June 1864, a unanimous vote from both the members of the House of Representatives District Committee and then the entire House of Representatives stopped the project as Congress had not authorized the building. It was torn down but the walls were already up and showed what a modern market could look like.[60]\n\n\n\n\nCenter Market (1871)[9]\n\nConstruction: 1871-78 Additions by Cluss: 1886 Demolished: 1931\n\nBetween B St (now Constitution Ave) and Pennsylvania Ave \u2013 between 7th and 9th St, NW Washington, DC38\u00b053\u203235.1\u2033N 77\u00b001\u203222.7\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.893083\u00b0N 77.022972\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.893083; -77.022972\n\nThe Center Market building was chartered by Congress on May 20, 1870, and opened for business on July 1, 1872.At the time of its construction, it was the largest market hall in the country (57,500 square feet)\u2014large enough to supply the rapidly growing urban population of D.C. with fresh groceries.[61] The market was built without alleys or driveways for traffic in the hoped of encouraging customers to stroll leisurely around the market. The building had three wings connected to one another with a total of 666 stalls:\nthe 7th Street Wing which ran parallel to 7th Street NW (stalls 1 to 155)\nthe B Street Wing which ran parallel to B Street NW connecting the 7th Street Wing to the 9th Street Wing (stalls 156 to 511)\nthe 9th Street Wing which ran parallel to 9th Street NW (stalls 512 to 666)\nAll the buildings were two stories high and the 7th Street Wing and the 9th Street Wing were both flanked with two towers and a metal awning over the main entrances. Another metal awning ran the entire length of B Street NW and 9th Street NW. These protected shoppers visiting the outdoors stalls. For a small fee, street dealers could place their stands outside, under the market canopy.\n\n\n\n\n\nEastern Market[9]\n\nConstruction: 1872-73 Restoration: 2007-2009\n\n225 7th SE Washington, DC38\u00b053\u203211.8\u2033N 76\u00b059\u203247.4\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.886611\u00b0N 76.996500\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.886611; -76.996500\n\n\n\n\n\nSchools[edit]\n\n\nName\n\nDates\n\nLocation / GPS\n\nDescription\n\nPicture\n\n\nWallach School[9]\n\nConstruction: 1864 Demolished: 1950\n\nNortheast corner of 7th and D St SE, off of Pennsylvania Ave SE Washington, DC38\u00b053\u203205.4\u2033N 76\u00b059\u203244.1\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.884833\u00b0N 76.995583\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.884833; -76.995583\n\nCluss and Kammerhueber's first project.

It was to be built on Reservation No. 2 (between 14th and 12th Street SW) on the mall between the Washington Memorial Grounds and the Smithsonian Buildings. It was to be 172 feet by 61 1/2 feet, two stories high with a basement and be fire-proof. It would be made of pressed bricks with a sandstone base.[63]On the west side of the building a conservatory was built in the same alignment along with other smaller buildings on the south. The areas on the north and south of the building were landscaped into a Victorian garden and arboretum between 1867 and 1879 and crops were being planted on the south side. After the Washington City Canal was filled in 1871 (based on Cluss' reports), the propagating garden closed. In exchanged, four acres previously used by the canal were acquired.[64] It was demolished in 1930 after a new building for the department was built to the south and so the building could be torn down to fulfill the McMillan Plan in a similar manner to Center Market down the Mall.\n\n\n\n\nRichards Building (U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey)\n\nConstruction: 1871 Demolished: 1929\n\n205 New Jersey Ave SE Washington, DC38\u00b053\u203213.6\u2033N 77\u00b000\u203230.7\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.887111\u00b0N 77.008528\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.887111; -77.008528\n\nAdolf Cluss had worked for the Survey when he had first moved to Washington, DC. He had worked out of a building that was falling apart at the time. In 1870, he was given the opportunity to design four buildings spanning between New Jersey Ave SE and South Capitol St SE on Capitol Hill: two five-story buildings (the Main Building and the Back Building) and two smaller ones. The first two were equipped with elevators connecting all the floors and were connected with brick stairs and walkways. The Main Building was partially underground due to the hill configuration. Cluss used the round arch style (known as Rundbogenstil) to craft the red brick building with brown stone trim. The slate roof had red, blue and green patterns which were in sharp contrast with the classically-styled Capitol Building and other Federal buildings around. In 1929, the agency moved to the new Department of Commerce Building in the Federal Triangle between Pennsylvania & Constitution Aves NW and 14th & 6th St NW. It was demolished and Congress claimed the site to build the Longworth House Office Building for the House of Representatives in 1933.[65]\n\n\n\n\nOld Patent Office Building (Reconstruction) Today: National Portrait Gallery\n\nReconstruction: 1877-78\n\nBetween F & G St NWand 7th & 9th St NW  Washington, DC38\u00b053\u203252\u2033N 77\u00b001\u203223\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.89778\u00b0N 77.022936\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.89778; -77.022936\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Fish Commission\n\nConstruction: 1881 Demolished: 1950s\n\n1443 Massachusetts Ave NW Washington, DC38\u00b054\u203223.5\u2033N 77\u00b001\u203259.4\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.906528\u00b0N 77.033167\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.906528; -77.033167\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitary commissions[edit]\n\n\nName\n\nDates\n\nLocation / GPS\n\nDescription\n\nPicture\n\n\nPowder Magazines for the Navy Yard\n\nConstruction: between 1859 and 1864 Demolished\n\nWashington Navy Yard Washington, DC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowder Magazines for the US Arsenal\n\nConstruction: between 1861 and 1864 Demolished\n\nUS Arsenal (Fort Lesley J.

It is at that time that he designed his first building: the New Ordnance Foundry. Designed in 1860, it was to house the armory as well as to manufacture modern high-power guns. It contained 18 furnaces and made of bricks and iron. It was estimated to have cost $150,000 and was revolutionary in the sense that \"No other foundry in the country [is] adapted to casting guns above ground.\"In 1889, Cluss compiled a list of his buildings including a mention of \"numerous buildings at the US Navy Yard, Washington [,DC]\". Some have been identified, others have not yet.[66] Based on a map of the Navy Yard of 1881, it was building # 36. Today it would be located in the middle of the block between Isaac Hull Ave SE and Patterson Ave SE, between Tingey St SE and Sicard St SE.[67]\n\n\n\n\nUS Arsenal: Officers Barracks(remodel of east and west wings of the penitentiary)\n\nRemodel: 1869 West building demolished: 1903\n\nUS Arsenal  (Fort Lesley J.
