{"name": "Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat", "content": "Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat (French:\u00a0[iv\u0254n \u0283\u0254k\u025b b\u0281y.a] (listen); born 29 December 1923) is a French mathematician and physicist. She has made seminal contributions to the study of Einstein's general theory of relativity, by showing that the Einstein equations can be put into the form of an initial value problem which is well-posed. In 2015, her breakthrough paper was listed by the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity as one of thirteen 'milestone' results in the study of general relativity, across the hundred years in which it had been studied.[1]\n She was the first woman to be elected to the French Academy of Sciences and is a Grand Officier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.[2]\n Yvonne Bruhat was born in Lille in 1923.[3] Her mother was the philosophy professor Berthe Hubert and her father was the physicist Georges Bruhat, who died in 1945 in the concentration camp Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen.  Her brother Fran\u00e7ois Bruhat also became a mathematician, making notable contributions to the study of algebraic groups.\n Bruhat undertook her secondary school education in Paris. In 1941 she entered the prestigious Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral national competition, winning the silver medal for physics. From 1943 to 1946 she studied at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, and from 1946 was a teaching assistant there and undertook research advised by Andr\u00e9 Lichnerowicz.\n From 1949 to 1951 she was a research assistant at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, as a result of which she received her doctorate.[4]\n In 1951, she became a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Her supervisor, Jean Leray, suggested that she study the dynamics of the Einstein field equations. He also introduced her to Albert Einstein, whom she consulted with a few times further during her time at the Institute.\n In 1952, Bruhat and her husband were both offered jobs at Marseilles, precipitating her early departure from the Institute. In the same year, she published the local existence and uniqueness of solutions to the vacuum Einstein Equations, her most renowned achievement. Her work proves the well-posedness of the Einstein equation, and started the study of dynamics in General Relativity.\n In 1947, she married fellow mathematician L\u00e9once Four\u00e8s. Their daughter Michelle is now (as of 2016) an ecologist. Her doctoral work and early research is under the name Yvonne Four\u00e8s-Bruhat. In 1960, Bruhat and her husband divorced, with her later marrying the mathematician Gustave Choquet and changing her last name to Choquet-Bruhat. She and Choquet had two children; her son, Daniel Choquet, is a neuroscientist and her daughter, Genevi\u00e8ve, is a doctor.\n In 1958, she was awarded the CNRS Silver Medal.[5] From 1958 to 1959 she taught at the University of Reims.  In 1960 she became a professor at the Universit\u00e9 Pierre-et-Marie-Curie (UPMC) in Paris, and has remained professor or professor emeritus until her retirement in 1992.\n At the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie she continued to make significant contributions to mathematical physics, notably in general relativity, supergravity, and the non-Abelian gauge theories of the standard model. Her work in 1981 with Demetrios Christodoulou showed the existence of global solutions of the Yang-Mills, Higgs, and Spinor Field Equations in 3+1 Dimensions.[6] Additionally in 1984 she made perhaps the first study by a mathematician of supergravity with results that can be extended to the currently important model in D=11 dimensions.[7]\n In 1978 Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat was elected a correspondent to the Academy of Sciences and on 14 May 1979 became the first woman to be elected a full member. From 1980 to 1983 she was President of the Comit\u00e9 international de relativit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et gravitation (\"International committee on general relativity and gravitation\").  In 1985 she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  In 1986 she was chosen to deliver the prestigious  Noether Lecture by the Association for Women in Mathematics.\n Choquet-Bruhat's best-known research deals with the mathematical nature of the initial data formulation of general relativity. A summary of results can be phrased purely in terms of standard differential geometric objects.\n In this sense, an initial data set can be viewed as the prescription of the submanifold geometry of an embedded spacelike hypersurface in a Lorentzian manifold.\n One of Choquet-Bruhat's seminal 1952 results states the following:\n Every vacuum initial data set (M, g, k) has a development f\u00a0: M \u2192 (M, g) such that g has zero Ricci curvature, and such that every inextendible timelike curve in the Lorentzian manifold (M, g) intersects f(M) exactly once. Briefly, this can be summarized as saying that (M, g) is a vacuum spacetime for which f(M) is a Cauchy surface. Such a development is called a globally hyperbolic vacuum development. Choquet-Bruhat also proved a uniqueness theorem:\n Given any two globally hyperbolic vacuum developments f1\u00a0: M \u2192 (M1, g1) and f2\u00a0: M \u2192 (M2, g2) of the same vacuum initial data set, there is an open subset U1 of M1 containing f1(M) and an open subset U2 of M2 containing f1(M), together with an isometry i\u00a0: (U1, g1) \u2192 (U2, g2) such that i(f1(p)) = f2(p) for all p in M. In a slightly imprecise form, this says: given any embedded spacelike hypersurface M of a Ricci-flat Lorentzian manifold M, the geometry of M near M is fully determined by the submanifold geometry of M.\n In an article written with Robert Geroch in 1969, Choquet-Bruhat fully clarified the nature of uniqueness. With a two-page argument in point-set topology using Zorn's lemma, they showed that Choquet-Bruhat's above existence and uniqueness theorems automatically imply a global uniqueness theorem:\n Any vacuum initial data set (M, g, k) has a maximal globally hyperbolic vacuum development, meaning a globally hyperbolic vacuum development f\u00a0: M \u2192 (M, g) such that, for any other globally hyperbolic vacuum development f1\u00a0: M \u2192 (M1, g1), there is an open subset U of M containing f(M) and an isometry i\u00a0: M1 \u2192 U such that i(f1(p)) = f(p) for all p in M.Any two maximal globally hyperbolic vacuum developments of the same vacuum initial data are isometric to one another. It is now common to study such developments. For instance, the well-known theorem of Demetrios Christodoulou and Sergiu Klainerman on stability of Minkowski space asserts that if (\u211d3, g, k) is a vacuum initial data set with g and k sufficiently close to zero (in a certain precise form), then its maximal globally hyperbolic vacuum development is geodesically complete and geometrically close to Minkowski space.\n Choquet-Bruhat's proof makes use of a clever choice of coordinates, the wave coordinates (which are the Lorentzian equivalent to the harmonic coordinates), in which the Einstein equation becomes a hyperbolic partial differential equation, for which well-posedness results can be applied.\n Articles\n Survey articles\n Technical books\n Popular book\n ", "tags": ["French physicists", "Mathematical physicists", "PDE theorists", "1923 births", "Living people", "French women mathematicians", "French women physicists", "Grand Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne faculty", "University of Paris faculty", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni", "People from Lille", "20th-century French mathematicians", "20th-century physicists", "20th-century French women scientists", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Articles with French-language sources (fr)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with hAudio microformats", "Articles containing French-language text", "Articles needing additional references from May 2020", "All articles needing additional references", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "CS1 maint: uses authors parameter", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French mathematician, physicist\nYvonne Choquet-BruhatYvonne Choquet-Bruhat in 2006Born (1923-12-29) 29 December 1923 (age\u00a097)Lille, FranceNationalityFrenchAlma\u00a0mater\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieureFrench National Centre for Scientific ResearchKnown\u00a0forWell-posedness of the vacuum Einstein EquationsAwardsGrand Officier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur Elected to the French Academy of Sciences Elected to the American Academy of Arts and SciencesScientific careerFieldsMathematics, physicsInstitutionsPierre and Marie Curie UniversityThesisTh\u00e9or\u00e8me d'existence pour certains syst\u00e8mes d'\u00e9quations aux d\u00e9riv\u00e9es partielles non lin\u00e9aires\u00a0(1951)Doctoral advisorAndr\u00e9 Lichn\u00e9rowicz\n\nYvonne Choquet-Bruhat (French:\u00a0[iv\u0254n \u0283\u0254k\u025b b\u0281y.a] (listen); born 29 December 1923) is a French mathematician and physicist.

A summary of results can be phrased purely in terms of standard differential geometric objects.\n\nAn initial data set is a triplet (M, g, k) in which M is a three-dimensional smooth manifold, g is a smooth Riemannian metric on M, and k is a smooth (0,2)-tensor field on M.\nGiven an initial data set (M, g, k), a development of (M, g, k) is a four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold (M, g) together with a smooth embedding f\u00a0: M \u2192 M and a smooth unit normal vector field along f such that f *g = g and such that the second fundamental form of f, relative to the given normal vector field, is k.\nIn this sense, an initial data set can be viewed as the prescription of the submanifold geometry of an embedded spacelike hypersurface in a Lorentzian manifold.\n\nAn initial data set (M, g, k) satisfies the vacuum constraint equations, or is said to be a vacuum initial data set, if the following two equations are satisfied:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\ng\n\n\n\u2212\n\n|\n\nk\n\n\n|\n\n\ng\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n(\n\ntr\n\ng\n\n\n\u2061\nk\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\ndiv\n\ng\n\n\n\u2061\nk\n\u2212\nd\n(\n\ntr\n\ng\n\n\n\u2061\nk\n)\n\n\n\n=\n0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}R^{g}-|k|_{g}^{2}+(\\operatorname {tr} ^{g}k)^{2}&=0\\\\\\operatorname {div} ^{g}k-d(\\operatorname {tr} ^{g}k)&=0.\\end{aligned}}}\n\n\nHere Rg denotes the scalar curvature of g.\nOne of Choquet-Bruhat's seminal 1952 results states the following:\n\nEvery vacuum initial data set (M, g, k) has a development f\u00a0: M \u2192 (M, g) such that g has zero Ricci curvature, and such that every inextendible timelike curve in the Lorentzian manifold (M, g) intersects f(M) exactly once.\nBriefly, this can be summarized as saying that (M, g) is a vacuum spacetime for which f(M) is a Cauchy surface. Such a development is called a globally hyperbolic vacuum development. Choquet-Bruhat also proved a uniqueness theorem:\n\nGiven any two globally hyperbolic vacuum developments f1\u00a0: M \u2192 (M1, g1) and f2\u00a0: M \u2192 (M2, g2) of the same vacuum initial data set, there is an open subset U1 of M1 containing f1(M) and an open subset U2 of M2 containing f1(M), together with an isometry i\u00a0: (U1, g1) \u2192 (U2, g2) such that i(f1(p)) = f2(p) for all p in M.\nIn a slightly imprecise form, this says: given any embedded spacelike hypersurface M of a Ricci-flat Lorentzian manifold M, the geometry of M near M is fully determined by the submanifold geometry of M.\nIn an article written with Robert Geroch in 1969, Choquet-Bruhat fully clarified the nature of uniqueness.
