His dissertation, Maximum Matchings without Blossoms, was supervised by Manuel Blum.[2]\nAfter postdoctoral research with Michael O. Rabin and Leslie Valiant at Harvard University, he joined the faculty at Cornell University in 1984. He moved to the IIT Delhi as a full professor in 1990, and moved again to the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1995. He was also a McKay Visiting Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Distinguished SISL Visitor at the Social and Information Sciences Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. In 2017 he moved to the University of California, Irvine as Distinguished Professor.\n Vazirani's research career has been centered around the design of algorithms, together with work on computational complexity theory, cryptography, and algorithmic game theory.\n During the 1980s, he made seminal contributions to the classical maximum matching problem,[3] and some key contributions to computational complexity theory, e.g., the isolation lemma, the Valiant-Vazirani theorem, and the equivalence between random generation and approximate counting.[4] During the 1990s he worked mostly on approximation algorithms, championing the primal-dual schema, which he applied to problems arising in network design, facility location[5] and web caching, and clustering. In July 2001 he published what is widely regarded as the definitive book on approximation algorithms (Springer-Verlag, Berlin). Since 2002, he has been at the forefront \nof the effort to understand the computability of market equilibria, with an extensive body of work on the topic.\n His research results also include proving, along with Leslie Valiant, that if UNIQUE-SAT is in P, then NP = RP (Valiant\u2013Vazirani theorem), and obtaining in 1980, along with Silvio Micali, an algorithm for finding maximum matchings in general graphs; the latter is still the most efficient known algorithm for the problem.\nWith Mehta, Saberi, and Umesh Vazirani, he showed in 2007 how to formulate the problem of choosing advertisements for AdWords as an online matching problem, and found a solution to this problem with optimal competitive ratio.[6]\n In 2005 both Vazirani and his brother Umesh Vazirani (also a theoretical computer scientist, at the University of California, Berkeley) were inducted as Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery.[7][8]\nIn 2011, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.\n ", "tags": ["1951 births", "Living people", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni", "University of California, Berkeley alumni", "Cornell University faculty", "Georgia Tech faculty", "University of California, Irvine faculty", "Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery", "Theoretical computer scientists", "20th-century Indian mathematicians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "American Hindus", "American people of Sindhi descent", "Sindhi people", "American academics of Indian descent", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hindi-language text", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Vijay VaziraniVijay Vazirani in 2010 visiting the University of California, Berkeley.Born1957IndiaNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materMIT (Bachelor's degree)University of California, Berkeley (PhD)Harvard University (PostDoc)Awards\nACM Fellow\nGuggenheim Fellowship\nScientific careerFieldsalgorithms, computational complexity theory, algorithmic game theory.Institutions\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nIndian Institute of Technology, Delhi\nUniversity of California, Irvine\nDoctoral advisorManuel BlumDoctoral students\nNaveen Garg\nSamir Khuller\n\n\nVijay Virkumar Vazirani (Hindi: \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f \u0935\u0940\u0930\u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930 \u0935\u091c\u093c\u0940\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0940; b. 1957[1]) is an Indian American distinguished professor of computer science in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nContents\n\n1 Education and career\n2 Research\n3 Awards and honors\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEducation and career[edit]\nVazirani was pursuing Electrical engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi  but after his 2nd year he shifted to MIT and received his Bachelor's degree in Computer science from MIT in 1979 and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1983.
