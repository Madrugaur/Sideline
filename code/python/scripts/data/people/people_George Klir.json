{"name": "George Klir", "content": "George Ji\u0159\u00ed Klir (April 22, 1932 \u2013 May 27, 2016) was a Czech-American computer scientist and professor of systems sciences at Binghamton University in Binghamton, New York.\n George Klir was born in 1932 in Prague, Czechoslovakia. In 1957 he received a M.S.  degree in Electrical engineering at the Czech Technical University in Prague. In the early 1960s he taught at the Institute of Computer Research in Prague. In 1964 he received a doctorate in computer science from the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.\n In the 1960s Klir went to Iraq to teach at the Baghdad University for two years. At the end he managed to immigrate to the U.S.[3] He started teaching computer science at UCLA and at the Fairleigh Dickinson University. In 1969 he came to Binghamton University, where he later became professor of systems science. One year (1982\u20131983) he stayed as a fellow in Dutch Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIAS), where he completed the  manuscript of his book Architecture of Systems Problem Solving. In 2007 he retired after 37 years at the University. \n From 1974 to 2014 Klir was editor of the International Journal of General Systems, and from 1985 to 2016 of the International Book Series on Systems Science and Systems Engineering. From 1980 to 1984 George Klir was the first president of the International Federation for Systems Research (IFSR). In the years 1981\u20131982 he was also president of Society for General Systems Research, now International Society for the Systems Sciences. He was further president of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society from 1988 to 1991 and the International Fuzzy Systems Association (IFSA) from 1993 to 1995.\n Klir received numerous awards and honors, including 5 honorary doctoral degrees, the Gold Medal of Bernard Bolzano, Lotfi A. Zadeh Best Paper Award, the Kaufmann's Gold Medal, SUNY Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Research and IFSA Award for Outstanding Achievement.[4] In 2007 he was awarded the Fuzzy Systems Pioneer Award of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS).\n George Klir is known for path-breaking research over almost four decades. His earlier work was in the areas of systems modeling and simulation, logic design, computer architecture, and discrete mathematics. More current research since the 1990s include the areas of intelligent systems, generalized information theory, fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic, theory of generalized measures, and soft computing.\n Klir is the author of 23 books, over 300 articles, and he also edited 10 books:\n Books (selection):\n ", "tags": ["1932 births", "American computer scientists", "Czech computer scientists", "Fairleigh Dickinson University faculty", "2016 deaths", "Systems scientists", "Binghamton University faculty", "Czech Technical University in Prague alumni", "University of Baghdad faculty", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "George J.
