From 1914 to 1924, Sch\u00f6nfinkel was a member of David Hilbert's group at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany.[1] On 7 December 1920 he delivered a talk entitled Elemente der Logick (\"Elements of Logic\") to the group where he outlined the concept of combinatory logic. Heinrich Behmann, a member of Hilbert's group, later revised the text and published it in 1924.[2] In 1929, Sch\u00f6nfinkel had one other paper published, on special cases of the decision problem (Entscheidungsproblem), that was prepared by Paul Bernays.[3]\n After he left G\u00f6ttingen, Sch\u00f6nfinkel returned to Moscow. By 1927 he was reported to be mentally ill and in a sanatorium.[2][3] His later life was spent in poverty, and he died in Moscow some time in 1942. His papers were burned by his neighbors for heating.[3]\n Sch\u00f6nfinkel developed a formal system that avoided the use of bound variables. His system was essentially equivalent to a combinatory logic based upon the combinators B, C, I, K, and S. Sch\u00f6nfinkel was able to show that the system could be reduced to just K and S and outlined a proof that a version of this system had the same power as predicate logic.[2]\n His paper also showed that functions of two or more arguments could be replaced by functions taking a single argument.[4][5][6] This replacement mechanism simplifies work in both combinatory logic and lambda calculus and would later be called currying, after Haskell Curry. While Curry attributed the concept to Sch\u00f6nfinkel, it had already been used by Frege[7] (an example of Stigler's Law).\n The complete known published output of Sch\u00f6nfinkel consists of just two papers: his 1924 On the Building Blocks of Mathematical Logic, and another, 31-page paper from 1927, coauthored with Paul Bernays, entitled Zum Entscheidungsproblem der mathematischen Logik (On the Decision Problem of Mathematical Logic).\n ", "tags": ["1888 births", "1942 deaths", "20th-century Russian mathematicians", "Scientists from Dnipro", "Odessa University alumni", "Russian logicians", "Ukrainian Jews", "Russian people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent", "Russian philosophers", "Jewish philosophers", "Ukrainian philosophers", "Soviet logicians", "Ukrainian mathematicians", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Moses Ilyich Sch\u00f6nfinkelSch\u00f6nfinkel, c.1910Born(1888-09-29)September 29, 1888Ekaterinoslav, Russian Empire (now Dnipro, Ukraine)Died1942 (aged\u00a053\u201354)Moscow, Soviet UnionNationalityRussianCitizenshipRussianAlma\u00a0materNovorossiysk UniversityKnown\u00a0forCombinatory logicTechnique for binding argumentsBernays\u2013Sch\u00f6nfinkel classScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenInfluencesDavid HilbertInfluencedHaskell Curry\n\nMoses Ilyich Sch\u00f6nfinkel, also known as Moisei Isai'evich Sheinfinkel' (Russian: \u041c\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0418\u0441\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0428\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0444\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0435\u043b\u044c; 29 September 1888 \u2013 1942), was a Russian logician and mathematician, known for the invention of combinatory logic.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Work\n3 Publications\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nLife[edit]\nSch\u00f6nfinkel attended the Novorossiysk University of Odessa, studying mathematics under Samuil Osipovich Shatunovskii (1859\u20131929), who worked in geometry and the foundations of mathematics.
