She is Professor of Applied Probability and ARC Future Fellow in the University of Melbourne.[1]\n Luczak grew up in Poland, and began her university studies at age 16 at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru\u0144, studying the philology of the English language. However, after a second year studying philology at Keele University in the UK, she decided to switch to mathematics, and enrolled at St Catherine's College, Oxford. After her first year's examinations, she was able to obtain scholarship support and continue her studies and remain at Oxford for doctoral work.[2] She completed her D.Phil. in 2001 with a dissertation, Probability, algorithms and telecommunication systems, supervised by Colin McDiarmid and Dominic Welsh.[3]\n She became an assistant lecturer at the Statistical Laboratory at the University of Cambridge and then a reader in mathematics at the London School of Economics. However, in 2010, failing to receive an expected promotion to professor, she took instead a professorial chair at the University of Sheffield and a five-year Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Leadership Fellowship.
