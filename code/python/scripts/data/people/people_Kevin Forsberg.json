In the mid-1950s he participated in the Corona program. After graduation Forsberg started working for NASA at the Center for Systems Management.[3] Late 1960s he returned to Lockheed, where he worked over a decade at the Research Laboratories of the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, Palo Alto, California.\n Late 1970s he started as independent business consultant, and co-founded the management training and consulting company The Center for Systems Management, Inc. He is a member of the Project Management Institute and of INCOSE.\n Forsberg was elected Life-time Fellow by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 1976; and elected Certified Systems Engineering Professional (CSEP) by INCOSE in 2004. He was awarded in 1981 the NASA Public Service Medal for \"his outstanding technical and managerial contributions to the Space Shuttle Program.\" With Harold Mooz he is awarded both the Agency Seal Medal and in 2001 the INCOSE Pioneer Award acknowledging \"Working as a team with Kevin Forsberg, he has pioneered and tirelessly promoted the concept of the integration of system engineering and project management into a single seamless process.
