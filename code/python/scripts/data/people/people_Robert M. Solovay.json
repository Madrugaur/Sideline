Hugh Woodin and Matthew Foreman.[2]\n\nWork[edit]\nSolovay's theorems include:\n\nSolovay's theorem showing that, if one assumes the existence of an inaccessible cardinal, then the statement \"every set of real numbers is Lebesgue measurable\" is consistent with ZF without the axiom of choice;\nIsolating the notion of 0#;\nProving that the existence of a real-valued measurable cardinal is equiconsistent with the existence of a measurable cardinal;\nProving that if \n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n\n is a strong limit singular cardinal, greater than a strongly compact cardinal then \n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\u03bb\n\n\n=\n\n\u03bb\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2^{\\lambda }=\\lambda ^{+}}\n\n holds;\nProving that if \n\n\n\n\u03ba\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n\n is an uncountable regular cardinal, and \n\n\n\nS\n\u2286\n\u03ba\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S\\subseteq \\kappa }\n\n is a stationary set, then \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n can be decomposed into the union of \n\n\n\n\u03ba\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n\n disjoint stationary sets;\nWith Stanley Tennenbaum, developing the method of iterated forcing and showing the consistency of Suslin's hypothesis.\nWith Donald A. Martin, showed the consistency of Martin's Axiom with arbitrarily large cardinality of the continuum.\nOutside of set theory, developing (with Volker Strassen) the Solovay\u2013Strassen primality test, used to identify large natural numbers that are prime with high probability. This method has had implications for cryptography.\nWith T. P. Baker, J. Gill, proved that relativizing arguments cannot prove \n\n\n\nP\n\u2260\nN\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P\\neq NP}\n\n.[3]\nProving that GL (the normal modal logic which has the instances of the schema \n\n\n\n\u25fb\n(\n\u25fb\nA\n\u2192\nA\n)\n\u2192\n\u25fb\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box (\\Box A\\to A)\\to \\Box A}\n\n as additional axioms) completely axiomatizes the logic of the provability predicate of Peano Arithmetic.\nWith Alexei Kitaev, proving that a finite set of quantum gates can efficiently approximate an arbitrary unitary operator on one qubit.\nSelected publications[edit]\nSolovay, Robert M.
