{"name": "Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn", "content": "\n Andr\u00e9-Gustave Citro\u00ebn (French:\u00a0[\u0251\u0303d\u0281e \u0261ystav sit\u0281\u0254\u025bn]; 5 February 1878 \u2013 3 July 1935) was a French industrialist and the founder of French automaker Citro\u00ebn. He is remembered chiefly for the make of car named after him, but also for his application of double helical gears.\n Born in Paris in 1878, Andr\u00e9-Gustave was the fifth and last child of Jewish parents,[1][2][3] diamond merchant Levie Citroen and Masza Amelia Kleinman. He was a cousin of the British philosopher Sir A. J. Ayer (the only son of his aunt Reine).\n The Citroen family moved to Paris in 1873. Upon arrival, the French diaeresis was added to the Dutch surname (reputedly by one of Andr\u00e9's teachers), changing Citroen to Citro\u00ebn. Citroen comes from a grandfather in the Netherlands who had been a greengrocer and seller of tropical fruit, and had taken the surname of Limoenman, Dutch for \"lime man,\" his son however changed it to Citroen, which in Dutch means \"lemon\".\n His father committed suicide when Andr\u00e9 was six years old (presumably after failure in a business venture in a diamond mine in South Africa). It is reputed that the young Andr\u00e9 was inspired by the works of Jules Verne and had seen the construction of the Eiffel Tower for the World Exhibition, making him want to become an engineer.\n Andr\u00e9 was a graduate of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1900. In that year he visited Poland, the birthland of his mother, who had recently died. During that holiday, he saw a carpenter working on a set of gears with a fish bone structure. These gears were less noisy, and more efficient. \n Citro\u00ebn bought the patent for very little money, leading to the invention that is credited to Citro\u00ebn: double helical gears. Also reputed to be the inspiration of the double chevron logo of the brand of Citro\u00ebn. In 1908, he was installed as a chairman for the automotive company Mors, where he was very successful.[4]\n During World War I, he was responsible for mass production of armaments. Citro\u00ebn gained an international reputation during the war, and more as the leading production expert in France. His activities were extensive in connection with the Renault plant, which employed 35,000 men in the manufacture of munitions during the war.[citation needed]\n In the middle of 1919, Citro\u00ebn was one of the directors of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise Doble, Paris, to build steam cars in France. Some other directors of the company were Paul Sicault, of the Renault Co.; M. Mery, of the Turcat-Mery Co.; M. Delage, the automobile designer.[citation needed] The design was not feasible and Citro\u00ebn turned to other projects.\n Citro\u00ebn founded the Citro\u00ebn automobile company in 1919, leading it to become the fourth largest automobile manufacturer in the world by the beginning of the 1930s (specifically 1932).[citation needed] The costs of developing the advanced front wheel drive unibody Traction Avant and redeveloping the factory to produce it at the same time, led to bankruptcy in 1934. It was taken over by the main creditor Michelin, who had provided tires for the cars. The Traction Avant after initial problems improved the sales for the company, and was a great success and was in production apart from during World War II until 1957.\n He died in Paris, France, of stomach cancer in 1935, and was interred in the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse, the funeral being led by the Chief Rabbi of Paris.\n On 9 October 1958, while the Motor show was running, the city fathers renamed the Quai de Javel as the \"Quai Andr\u00e9-Citro\u00ebn,\" in recognition of the transformation effected since the city's 15th arrondissement, two generations earlier characterized by market gardening, had been selected by Citro\u00ebn as the location for Europe's first mass production car plant.[5]\n This was the second celebrity name for the street which in 1843 had been baptised \"Quai de Javel,\" in recognition of the chemical factory that had been set up to produce a range of industrial acids, and which later numbered the well known eponymous \"Eau de Javel\" (bleach) among its products.[5]\n In 1992, the Parc Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn public garden in Paris was named after him. It was built on the site of the former automobile manufacturing plant of Citro\u00ebn, which operated until its closure in the 1970s, and which had been demolished during an eight-year period, between 1976 and 1984.[6] In 1998, Andr\u00e9-Citro\u00ebn was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Michigan.[7]\n ", "tags": ["1878 births", "1935 deaths", "Citro\u00ebn", "French chief executives", "French automotive pioneers", "Engineers from Paris", "French automobile designers", "French founders of automobile manufacturers", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni", "Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand alumni", "French people of Dutch-Jewish descent", "French Jews", "French people of Polish-Jewish descent", "Deaths from cancer in France", "Deaths from stomach cancer", "Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery", "Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet alumni", "Businesspeople from Paris", "French Freemasons", "CS1: long volume value", "Use dmy dates from January 2020", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2016", "Articles with unsourced statements from November 2012", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with French-language sources (fr)", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nAndr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebnAndr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn on an ocean voyageBornAndr\u00e9-Gustave Citro\u00ebn(1878-02-05)5 February 1878Paris, FranceDied3 July 1935(1935-07-03) (aged\u00a057)Paris, FranceNationalityFrenchOccupationBusiness, engineeringKnown\u00a0forFounder of Citro\u00ebnParent(s)Levie Citroen and Masza Amelia KleinmanRelativesAlfred Lindon (brother in law)\n The gears with double chevrons that reputedly were the basis of the Citro\u00ebn logo.\n His grave in Paris (2011)\nAndr\u00e9-Gustave Citro\u00ebn (French:\u00a0[\u0251\u0303d\u0281e \u0261ystav sit\u0281\u0254\u025bn]; 5 February 1878 \u2013 3 July 1935) was a French industrialist and the founder of French automaker Citro\u00ebn.
