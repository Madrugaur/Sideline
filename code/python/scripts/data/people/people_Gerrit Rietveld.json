{"name": "Gerrit Rietveld", "content": "Gerrit Thomas Rietveld (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0263\u025br\u026at \u02c8to\u02d0m\u0251s \u02c8ritv\u025blt]; 24 June 1888 \u2013 25 June 1964) was a Dutch furniture designer and architect. One of the principal members of the Dutch artistic movement called De Stijl, Rietveld is famous for his Red and Blue Chair and for the Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n Rietveld was born in Utrecht on 24 June 1888 as the son of a joiner. He left school at 11 to be apprenticed to his father and enrolled at night school[1] before working as a draughtsman for C. J. Begeer, a jeweller in Utrecht, from 1906 to 1911.[2]\n By the time he opened his own furniture workshop in 1917, Rietveld had taught himself drawing, painting and model-making. He afterwards set up in business as a cabinet-maker.[3]\n Rietveld designed his Red and Blue Chair in 1917 which has become an iconic piece of modern furniture. Hoping that much of his furniture would eventually be mass-produced rather than handcrafted, Rietveld aimed for simplicity in construction.[4] In 1918, he started his own furniture factory, and changed the chair's colours after becoming influenced by the De Stijl movement, of which he became a member in 1919, the same year in which he became an architect. The contacts that he made at De Stijl gave him the opportunity to exhibit abroad as well. In 1923, Walter Gropius invited Rietveld to exhibit at the Bauhaus.[5]\n He built the Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House, in 1924, in close collaboration with the owner Truus Schr\u00f6der-Schr\u00e4der. Built in Utrecht on the Prins Hendriklaan 50, the house has a conventional ground floor, but is radical on the top floor, lacking fixed walls but instead relying on sliding walls to create and change living spaces.  The house has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000. His involvement in the Schr\u00f6der House exerted a strong influence on Truus' daughter, Han Schr\u00f6der, who became one of the first female architects in the Netherlands.[6]\n Rietveld broke with De Stijl in 1928 and became associated with a more functionalist style of architecture, known as either Nieuwe Zakelijkheid or Nieuwe Bouwen. The same year he joined the Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne. From the late 1920s he was concerned with social housing, inexpensive production methods, new materials, prefabrication and standardisation. In 1927 he was already experimenting with prefabricated concrete slabs, a very unusual material at that time. In the 1920s and 1930s, however, all his commissions came from private individuals, and it was not until the 1950s that he was able to put his progressive ideas about social housing into practice, in projects in Utrecht and Reeuwijk.[7]\n Rietveld designed the Zig-Zag Chair in 1934 and started the design of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which was finished after his death.\n In 1951 Rietveld designed a retrospective exhibition about De Stijl which was held in Amsterdam, Venice and New York. Interest in his work revived as a result. In subsequent years he was given many commissions, including the Dutch pavilion for the Venice Biennale (1953), the art academies in Amsterdam and Arnhem, and the press room for the UNESCO building in Paris. Designed for the display of small sculptures at the Third International Sculpture Exhibition in Arnhem's Sonsbeek Park in 1955, Rietveld's \u2018Sonsbeek Pavilion\u2019 was rebuilt at the Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum in 1965.[8] Due to irreparable damages caused by regular decay, it was once again rebuilt, this time with new materials, in 2010. In order to handle all these projects, in 1961 Rietveld set up a partnership with the architects Johan van Dillen and J. van Tricht built hundreds of homes, many of them in the city of Utrecht.[9]\n His work was neglected when rationalism came into vogue, but he later benefited from a revival of the style of the 1920s thirty years later.[3]\n Rietveld died on 25 June 1964 in Utrecht.\n His son Wim Rietveld also became a renowned industrial designer.\n Rietveld had his first retrospective exhibition devoted to his architectural work at the Central Museum, Utrecht, in 1958. When the art academy in Amsterdam became part of the higher professional education system in 1968 and was given the status of an Academy for Fine Arts and Design, the name was changed to the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in honour of Rietveld.[10] \"Gerrit Rietveld: A Centenary Exhibition\" at the Barry Friedman Gallery, New York, in 1988 was the first comprehensive presentation of the Dutch architect's original works ever held in the U.S. The highlight of a celebratory \u201cRietveld Year\u201d in Utrecht, the exhibition \u201cRietveld\u2019s Universe\u201d opened at the Centraal Museum and compared him and his work with famous contemporaries like Wright, Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe.[11]\n Two software tools, both for code review, have been named after Gerrit Rietveld: Gerrit and Rietveld.\n ", "tags": ["Gerrit Rietveld", "1888 births", "1964 deaths", "20th-century Dutch architects", "20th-century Dutch artists", "Artists from Utrecht", "Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne members", "Constructivist architects", "De Stijl", "Dutch furniture designers", "Dutch graphic designers", "Dutch industrial designers", "Furniture makers", "Modernist architects", "Modernist architecture in the Netherlands", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with AGSA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BPN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NGV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with suppressed authority control identifiers", "Articles containing video clips"], "raw": "Dutch furniture designer and architect\nGerrit RietveldRietveld in 1962BornGerrit Thomas Rietveld(1888-06-24)24 June 1888Utrecht, NetherlandsDied25 June 1964(1964-06-25) (aged\u00a076)Utrecht, NetherlandsResting placeSoestbergen CemeteryUtrecht, NetherlandsMonuments[1]NationalityDutchOccupationBuilding designer, architectKnown\u00a0forGerrit Rietveld Pizzaria (1917)Schr\u00f6der House (1924)Spouse(s)Vrouwgien Hadders (1883\u20131957)Partner(s)Truus Schr\u00f6der-Schr\u00e4derWebsitehttp://www.gerrit-rietveld.nl/\nGerrit Thomas Rietveld (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0263\u025br\u026at \u02c8to\u02d0m\u0251s \u02c8ritv\u025blt]; 24 June 1888 \u2013 25 June 1964) was a Dutch furniture designer and architect.
