{"name": "\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet", "content": "Gabrielle \u00c9milie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Marquise du Ch\u00e2telet (French pronunciation:\u00a0[emili dy \u0283\u0251tl\u025b] (listen); 17 December 1706 \u00a0\u2013 10 September 1749) was a French natural philosopher and mathematician during the early 1730s until her untimely death due to complications during childbirth in 1749. Her most recognized achievement is her translation of and commentary on Isaac Newton's 1687 book Principia containing basic laws of physics. The translation, published posthumously in 1756, is still considered the standard French translation today. Her commentary includes a profound contribution to Newtonian mechanics\u2014the postulate of an additional conservation law for total energy, of which kinetic energy of motion is one element. This led to her conceptualization of energy as such, and to derive its quantitative relationships to the mass and velocity of an object.\n Her philosophical magnum opus, Institutions de Physique (Paris, 1740, first edition), or Foundations of Physics, circulated widely, generated heated debates, and was republished and translated into several other languages within two years of its original publication. She participated in the famous vis viva debate, concerning the best way to measure the force of a body and the best means of thinking about conservation principles. Posthumously, her ideas were heavily represented in the most famous text of the French Enlightenment, the Encyclop\u00e9die of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, first published shortly after du Ch\u00e2telet's death. Numerous biographies, books and plays have been written about her life and work in the two centuries since her death. In the early 21st century, her life and ideas have generated renewed interest.\n In addition to producing famous translations of works by authors such as Bernard Mandeville and Isaac Newton, Du Ch\u00e2telet wrote a number of significant philosophical essays, letters and books that were well known in her time.\n Because of her well-known collaboration and romantic involvement with Voltaire, which spanned much of her adult life, for generations Du Ch\u00e2telet has been known as mistress and collaborator to her much better known intellectual companion. Her accomplishments and achievements have often been subsumed under his, and as a result, even today she is often mentioned only within the context of Voltaire's life and work during the period of the early French Enlightenment. The ideals of her works spread from the ideals of individual empowerment to issues of the social contract.\n Recently, however, professional philosophers and historians[citation needed] have transformed the reception of Du Ch\u00e2telet. Historical evidence indicates that Du Ch\u00e2telet's work had a very significant influence on the philosophical and scientific conversations of the 1730s and 1740s \u2013 in fact, she was famous and respected by the greatest thinkers of her time.\n Du Ch\u00e2telet corresponded with renowned mathematicians such as Johann II Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler, early developers of calculus. She was also tutored by Bernoulli's prodigy students, Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis and Alexis Claude Clairaut. Frederick the Great of Prussia, who re-founded the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, was her great admirer, and corresponded with both Voltaire and Du Ch\u00e2telet regularly. He introduced Du Ch\u00e2telet to Leibniz's philosophy by sending her the works of Christian Wolff, and Du Ch\u00e2telet sent him a copy of her Institutions.\n Her works were published and republished in Paris, London, and Amsterdam; they were translated into German and Italian; and, they were discussed in the most important scholarly journals of the era, including the Memoires des Tr\u00e9voux, the Journal des S\u00e7avans, the G\u00f6ttingische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen, and others. Perhaps most intriguingly, many of her ideas were represented in various sections of the Encyclop\u00e9die of Diderot and D'Alembert, and some of the articles in the Encyclop\u00e9die are a direct copy of her work (this is an active area of current academic research - the latest research can be found at Project Vox, a Duke University research initiative).\n \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet was born on 17 December 1706 in Paris, the only girl amongst six children. Three brothers lived to adulthood: Ren\u00e9-Alexandre (b. 1698), Charles-Auguste (b. 1701), and Elisabeth-Th\u00e9odore (b. 1710). Her eldest brother, Ren\u00e9-Alexandre, died in 1720, and the next brother, Charles-Auguste, died in 1731. However, her younger brother, Elisabeth-Th\u00e9odore, lived to a successful old age, becoming an abbot and eventually a bishop. Two other brothers died very young.[1] Du Ch\u00e2telet also had an illegitimate half-sister, Michelle, who was born of her father and Anne Bellinzani, an intelligent woman who was interested in astronomy and married to an important Parisian official.[2]\n Her father was Louis Nicolas le Tonnelier de Breteuil, a member of the lesser nobility. At the time of Du Ch\u00e2telet's birth, her father held the position of the Principal Secretary and Introducer of Ambassadors to King Louis XIV. He held a weekly salon on Thursdays, to which well-respected writers and scientists were invited. Her mother was Gabrielle Anne de Froullay, Baronne de Breteuil.[3]\n Du Ch\u00e2telet's education has been the subject of much speculation, but nothing is known with certainty.[4]\n Among their acquaintances was Fontenelle, the perpetual secretary of the French Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences. Du Ch\u00e2telet's father Louis-Nicolas, recognizing her early brilliance, arranged for Fontenelle to visit and talk about astronomy with her when she was 10 years old.[5] Du Ch\u00e2telet's mother, Gabrielle-Anne de Froulay, was brought up in a convent, at the time the predominant educational institution available to French girls and women.[5] While some sources believe her mother did not approve of her intelligent daughter, or of her husband's encouragement of \u00c9milie's intellectual curiosity,[5] there are also other indications that her mother not only approved of Du Ch\u00e2telet's early education, but actually encouraged her to vigorously question stated fact.[6]\n In either case, such encouragement would have been seen as unusual for parents of their time and status.  When she was small, her father arranged training for her in physical activities such as fencing and riding, and as she grew older, he brought tutors to the house for her.[5] As a result, by the age of twelve she was fluent in Latin, Italian, Greek and German; she was later to publish translations into French of Greek and Latin plays and philosophy. She received education in mathematics, literature, and science.\n Du Ch\u00e2telet also liked to dance, was a passable performer on the harpsichord, sang opera, and was an amateur actress. As a teenager, short of money for books, she used her mathematical skills to devise highly successful strategies for gambling.[5]\n On 12 June 1725, she married the Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet-Lomont.[7][note 1] Her marriage conferred the title of Marquise du Chastellet.[note 2] Like many marriages among the nobility, theirs was arranged.  As a wedding gift, the husband was made governor of Semur-en-Auxois in Burgundy by his father; the recently married couple moved there at the end of September 1725.  Du Ch\u00e2telet was eighteen at the time, her husband thirty-four.\n The Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet and \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet had three children: Fran\u00e7oise-Gabrielle-Pauline (30 June 1726 \u2013 1754, married in 1743 to Alfonso Carafa, Duca di Montenero), Louis Marie Florent (born 20 November 1727), and Victor-Esprit (born 11 April 1733).[8]  Victor-Esprit died as an infant in late summer 1734, likely the last Sunday in August.[9] On 4 September 1749 \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet gave birth to Stanislas-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde du Ch\u00e2telet (daughter of Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Saint-Lambert). She died as an infant in Lun\u00e9ville on 6 May 1751.[10]\n In 1733, aged 26, Du Ch\u00e2telet resumed her mathematical studies. Initially, she was tutored in algebra and calculus by Moreau de Maupertuis, a member of the Academy of Sciences; although mathematics was not his forte, he had received a solid education from Johann Bernoulli, who also taught Leonhard Euler. However by 1735 Du Ch\u00e2telet had turned for her mathematical training to Alexis Clairaut, a mathematical prodigy known best for Clairaut's equation and Clairaut's theorem. Du Ch\u00e2telet resourcefully sought some of France's best tutors and scholars to mentor her in mathematics. On one occasion at the Caf\u00e9 Gradot, a place where men frequently gathered for intellectual discussion, she was politely ejected when she attempted to join one of her teachers. Undeterred, she simply had some men's clothing made for herself and strolled back in.[11]\n Du Ch\u00e2telet may have met Voltaire in her childhood at one of her father's salons; Voltaire himself dates their meeting to 1729, when he returned from his exile in London. However, their friendship developed from May 1733 when she re-entered society after the birth of her third child.[4]\n Du Ch\u00e2telet invited Voltaire to live at her country house at Cirey in Haute-Marne, northeastern France, and he became her long-time companion. There she studied physics and mathematics and published scientific articles and translations. To judge from Voltaire's letters to friends and their commentaries on each other's work, they lived together with great mutual liking and respect. As a literary rather than scientific person, Voltaire implicitly acknowledged her contributions to his 1738 Elements of the Philosophy of Newton, where the chapters on optics show strong similarities with her own Essai sur l'optique. She was able to contribute further to the campaign by a laudatory review in the Journal des savants.[12]\n Sharing a passion for science, Voltaire and Du Ch\u00e2telet collaborated scientifically. They set up a laboratory in Du Ch\u00e2telet's home. In a healthy competition, they both entered the 1738 Paris Academy prize contest on the nature of fire, since Du Ch\u00e2telet disagreed with Voltaire's essay. Although neither of them won, both essays received honourable mention and were published.[13] She thus became the first woman to have a scientific paper published by the Academy.[14]\n Du Ch\u00e2telet's relationship with Voltaire caused her to give up most of her social life to become more involved with her study in mathematics with the teacher of Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis. He introduced the ideas of Isaac Newton to her. Letters written by Du Ch\u00e2telet explain how she felt during the transition from Parisian socialite to rural scholar, from \"one life to the next.\"[15]\n In May 1748, Du Ch\u00e2telet began an affair with the poet Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Saint-Lambert and became pregnant. In a letter to a friend she confided her fears that she would not survive her pregnancy. On the night of 4 September 1749 she gave birth to a daughter, Stanislas-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde. Du Ch\u00e2telet died on 10 September 1749,[16] at Lun\u00e9ville, from a pulmonary embolism. She was 42. Her daughter died 20 months later.[17]\n In her writing, Du Ch\u00e2telet criticizes John Locke's philosophy. She emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience: \"Locke's idea of the possibility of thinking matter is [\u2026] abstruse.\"[18] Her critique on Locke originates in her Bernard de Mandeville commentary on The Fable of the Bees. She confronts us with her resolute statement in favor of universal principles which precondition human knowledge and action, and maintains that this kind of law is innate. Du Ch\u00e2telet claims the necessity of a universal presupposition, because if there is no such beginning, all our knowledge is relative. In that way, Du Ch\u00e2telet rejects John Locke's aversion of innate ideas and prior principles. She also reverses Locke's negation of the principle of contradiction, which would constitute the basis of her methodic reflections in the Institutions. On the contrary, she affirms her arguments in favor of the necessity of prior and universal principles. \"Two and two could then make as well 4 as 6 if \nprior principles did not exist.\"[clarification needed]\n Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis' and Julien Offray de La Mettrie's references to Du Ch\u00e2telet's deliberations on motion, free will, thinking matter, numbers and the way to do metaphysics are a sign of the importance of her reflections. She rebuts the claim to finding truth by using mathematical laws, and argues against Maupertuis.[19]\n In 1737 Ch\u00e2telet published a paper entitled Dissertation sur la nature et la propagation du feu,[20] based upon her research into the science of fire, that predicted what is today known as infrared radiation and the nature of light.[citation needed]\n Her book Institutions de Physique[21] (\"Lessons in Physics\") was published in 1740; it was presented as a review of new ideas in science and philosophy to be studied by her 13 year old son, but it incorporated and sought to reconcile complex ideas from the leading thinkers of the time. The book and subsequent debate contributed to her becoming a member of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna in 1746.\n In 1741 du Ch\u00e2telet published a book titled R\u00e9ponse de Madame la Marquise du Chastelet, a la lettre que M. de Mairan. Dortous de Mairan, secretary of the Academy of Sciences, had published a set of arguments addressed to her regarding the appropriate mathematical expression for forces vives. Du Ch\u00e2telet presented a spirited point by point rebuttal of de Mairan's arguments, causing him to withdraw from the controversy.[22]\n Immanuel Kant's first publication in 1747 'Gedanken zur wahren Sch\u00e4tzung der lebendigen Kr\u00e4fte' focuses on Du Ch\u00e2telet's pamphlet against the secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, Mairan. Kant's opponent, Johann Augustus Eberhard accused Kant of taking ideas from Du Ch\u00e2telet.[23]\n Although in the early 18th century the concepts of force and momentum had been long understood, the idea of energy as transferable between different systems was still in its infancy,  and would not be fully resolved until the 19th Century. It is now accepted that the total mechanical momentum of a system is conserved and none is lost to friction. Simply put, there is no 'momentum friction' and momentum can not transfer between different forms, and particularly there is no potential momentum. Emmy Noether later proved this to be true for all problems where the initial state is symmetric in generalized coordinates. Mechanical energy, kinetic and potential, may be lost to another form, but the total is conserved in time. The Du Ch\u00e2telet contribution was the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. In doing so, she became the first person in history to elucidate the concept of energy as such, and to quantify its relationship to mass and velocity based on her own empirical studies. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by Willem 's Gravesande in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity. The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height the balls were dropped from, equal to the initial potential energy. With the exception of Leibniz, earlier workers like Newton believed that \"energy\" was indistinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped. In classical physics the correct formula is \n\n\n\nE\n=\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nm\n\nv\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E={\\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E}\n\n is the kinetic energy of an object, \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n its mass and \n\n\n\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v}\n\n its speed.  Energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to relate it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat . . .). Newton's work assumed the exact conservation of only mechanical momentum. A broad range of mechanical problems are soluble only if energy conservation is included. The collision and scattering of two point masses is one of them. Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange established a more formal framework for mechanics using the results of du Ch\u00e2telet.[24][25]\n In 1749, the year of Du Ch\u00e2telet's death, she completed the work regarded as her outstanding achievement: her translation into French, with her commentary, of Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (often referred to as simply the Principia), including her derivation of the notion of conservation of energy from its principles of mechanics. Published ten years after her death, today Du Ch\u00e2telet's translation of the Principia is still the standard translation of the work into French. Her translation and commentary of the Principia contributed to the completion of the scientific revolution in France and to its acceptance in Europe.[26]\n She lost the considerable sum for the time of 84,000 francs\u2014some of it borrowed\u2014in one evening at the table at the Court of Fontainebleau, to card cheats.[5][27] To raise the money to pay back her debts she devised an ingenious financing arrangement similar to modern derivatives, whereby she paid tax collectors a fairly low sum for the right to their future earnings (they were allowed to keep a portion of the taxes they collected for the King), and promised to pay the court gamblers part of these future earnings.[5]\n Du Ch\u00e2telet wrote a critical analysis of the entire Bible. A synthesis of her remarks on the book of Genesis was published in English in 1967 by Ira O. Wade of Princeton in his book Voltaire and Madame du Ch\u00e2telet: An Essay on Intellectual Activity at Cirey and a book of her complete notes was published in 2011, in the original French, edited and annotated by Bertram Eugene Schwarzbach.\n Du Ch\u00e2telet wrote a monograph, Discours sur le bonheur, on the nature of happiness both in general and specialised to women.\n Du Ch\u00e2telet translated The Fable of the Bees in a free adaptation. She also wrote works on optics, rational linguistics, and the nature of free will.\n In her first independent work, the preface to her translation of the Fable of the Bees, du Ch\u00e2telet argues strongly for women's education, particularly a strong secondary education as was available for young men in the French coll\u00e8ges. By denying women a good education, she argues, society prevents women from becoming eminent in the arts and sciences.[28]\n Du Ch\u00e2telet made a crucial scientific contribution in making Newton's historic work more accessible in a timely, accurate and insightful French translation, augmented by her own original concept of energy conservation.\n A main-belt minor planet and a crater on Venus have been named in her honor, and she is the subject of three plays: Legacy of Light by Karen Zacar\u00edas; \u00c9milie: La Marquise Du Ch\u00e2telet Defends Her Life Tonight by Lauren Gunderson and Urania: the Life of \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet by Jyl Bonaguro.[29] The opera \u00c9milie of Kaija Saariaho is about the last moments of her life.[30]\n Du Ch\u00e2telet is often represented in portraits with mathematical iconography, such as holding a pair of dividers or a page of geometrical calculations. In the early nineteenth century, a French pamphlet of celebrated women (Femmes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres) introduced a possibly apocryphal story of Du Ch\u00e2telet's childhood.[31]  According to this story, a servant fashioned a doll for her by dressing up wooden dividers as a doll; however, du Ch\u00e2telet undressed the dividers and intuiting their purpose, made a circle with them.\n Since 2016, the French Society of Physics (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Physique) has awarded the Emilie Du Ch\u00e2telet Prize to a physicist or team of researchers for excellence in Physics.\n Duke University also presents an annual Du Ch\u00e2telet Prize in Philosophy of Physics \"for previously unpublished work in philosophy of physics by a graduate student or junior scholar.\"[32]\n ", "tags": ["1706 births", "1749 deaths", "18th-century French mathematicians", "18th-century French philosophers", "18th-century philosophers", "18th-century women scientists", "18th-century French women writers", "18th-century French writers", "Scientists from Paris", "French Marquesses", "Contributors to the Encyclop\u00e9die (1751\u20131772)", "French physicists", "French women scientists", "Women encyclopedists", "French women mathematicians", "French women physicists", "Deaths in childbirth", "Deaths from pulmonary embolism", "French translators", "French women philosophers", "18th-century French scientists", "Muses", "18th-century translators", "CS1 maint: others", "CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Biography with signature", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with hAudio microformats", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from December 2017", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from March 2018", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2018", "Commons link is defined as the pagename", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "French mathematician, physicist, and author\n\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2teletPortrait by Maurice Quentin de La TourBorn(1706-12-17)17 December 1706Paris, Kingdom of FranceDied10 September 1749(1749-09-10) (aged\u00a042)Lun\u00e9ville, Kingdom of FranceNationalityFrenchKnown\u00a0forTranslation of Newton's Principia into French, natural philosophy which combines Newtonian physics with Leibnizian metaphysics, and advocacy of Newtonian physicsSpouse(s)Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet-Lomont\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01725)\u200bPartner(s)Voltaire (1733\u20131749)ChildrenFran\u00e7oise Gabriel PaulineLouis Marie FlorentVictor-EspritStanislas-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde du Ch\u00e2teletScientific careerFields\nNatural philosophy\nMathematics\nPhysics\nInfluencesIsaac Newton, Gottfried Leibniz, Willem 's Gravesande\nSignature\nGabrielle \u00c9milie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Marquise du Ch\u00e2telet (French pronunciation:\u00a0[emili dy \u0283\u0251tl\u025b] (listen); 17 December 1706 \u00a0\u2013 10 September 1749) was a French natural philosopher and mathematician during the early 1730s until her untimely death due to complications during childbirth in 1749.

She received education in mathematics, literature, and science.\nDu Ch\u00e2telet also liked to dance, was a passable performer on the harpsichord, sang opera, and was an amateur actress. As a teenager, short of money for books, she used her mathematical skills to devise highly successful strategies for gambling.[5]\n\nMarriage[edit]\nOn 12 June 1725, she married the Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet-Lomont.[7][note 1] Her marriage conferred the title of Marquise du Chastellet.[note 2] Like many marriages among the nobility, theirs was arranged.  As a wedding gift, the husband was made governor of Semur-en-Auxois in Burgundy by his father; the recently married couple moved there at the end of September 1725.  Du Ch\u00e2telet was eighteen at the time, her husband thirty-four.\n\nChildren[edit]\nThe Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet and \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet had three children: Fran\u00e7oise-Gabrielle-Pauline (30 June 1726 \u2013 1754, married in 1743 to Alfonso Carafa, Duca di Montenero), Louis Marie Florent (born 20 November 1727), and Victor-Esprit (born 11 April 1733).[8]  Victor-Esprit died as an infant in late summer 1734, likely the last Sunday in August.[9] On 4 September 1749 \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet gave birth to Stanislas-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde du Ch\u00e2telet (daughter of Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Saint-Lambert). She died as an infant in Lun\u00e9ville on 6 May 1751.[10]\n\nResumption of studies[edit]\nIn 1733, aged 26, Du Ch\u00e2telet resumed her mathematical studies. Initially, she was tutored in algebra and calculus by Moreau de Maupertuis, a member of the Academy of Sciences; although mathematics was not his forte, he had received a solid education from Johann Bernoulli, who also taught Leonhard Euler. However by 1735 Du Ch\u00e2telet had turned for her mathematical training to Alexis Clairaut, a mathematical prodigy known best for Clairaut's equation and Clairaut's theorem. Du Ch\u00e2telet resourcefully sought some of France's best tutors and scholars to mentor her in mathematics. On one occasion at the Caf\u00e9 Gradot, a place where men frequently gathered for intellectual discussion, she was politely ejected when she attempted to join one of her teachers. Undeterred, she simply had some men's clothing made for herself and strolled back in.[11]\n\nRelationship with Voltaire[edit]\n In the frontispiece to Voltaire's book on Newton's philosophy, du Ch\u00e2telet appears as Voltaire's muse, reflecting Newton's heavenly insights down to Voltaire.\nDu Ch\u00e2telet may have met Voltaire in her childhood at one of her father's salons; Voltaire himself dates their meeting to 1729, when he returned from his exile in London. However, their friendship developed from May 1733 when she re-entered society after the birth of her third child.[4]\nDu Ch\u00e2telet invited Voltaire to live at her country house at Cirey in Haute-Marne, northeastern France, and he became her long-time companion. There she studied physics and mathematics and published scientific articles and translations. To judge from Voltaire's letters to friends and their commentaries on each other's work, they lived together with great mutual liking and respect. As a literary rather than scientific person, Voltaire implicitly acknowledged her contributions to his 1738 Elements of the Philosophy of Newton, where the chapters on optics show strong similarities with her own Essai sur l'optique. She was able to contribute further to the campaign by a laudatory review in the Journal des savants.[12]\nSharing a passion for science, Voltaire and Du Ch\u00e2telet collaborated scientifically. They set up a laboratory in Du Ch\u00e2telet's home. In a healthy competition, they both entered the 1738 Paris Academy prize contest on the nature of fire, since Du Ch\u00e2telet disagreed with Voltaire's essay. Although neither of them won, both essays received honourable mention and were published.[13] She thus became the first woman to have a scientific paper published by the Academy.[14]\n\nSocial life after living with Voltaire[edit]\n The chateau of Cirey\nDu Ch\u00e2telet's relationship with Voltaire caused her to give up most of her social life to become more involved with her study in mathematics with the teacher of Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis. He introduced the ideas of Isaac Newton to her. Letters written by Du Ch\u00e2telet explain how she felt during the transition from Parisian socialite to rural scholar, from \"one life to the next.\"[15]\n\nFinal pregnancy and death[edit]\n The chateau of Lun\u00e9ville\nIn May 1748, Du Ch\u00e2telet began an affair with the poet Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Saint-Lambert and became pregnant. In a letter to a friend she confided her fears that she would not survive her pregnancy. On the night of 4 September 1749 she gave birth to a daughter, Stanislas-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde. Du Ch\u00e2telet died on 10 September 1749,[16] at Lun\u00e9ville, from a pulmonary embolism. She was 42. Her daughter died 20 months later.[17]\n\nScientific research and publications[edit]\nCriticizing Locke and the debate on thinking matter[edit]\nIn her writing, Du Ch\u00e2telet criticizes John Locke's philosophy. She emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience: \"Locke's idea of the possibility of thinking matter is [\u2026] abstruse.\"[18] Her critique on Locke originates in her Bernard de Mandeville commentary on The Fable of the Bees. She confronts us with her resolute statement in favor of universal principles which precondition human knowledge and action, and maintains that this kind of law is innate. Du Ch\u00e2telet claims the necessity of a universal presupposition, because if there is no such beginning, all our knowledge is relative. In that way, Du Ch\u00e2telet rejects John Locke's aversion of innate ideas and prior principles. She also reverses Locke's negation of the principle of contradiction, which would constitute the basis of her methodic reflections in the Institutions. On the contrary, she affirms her arguments in favor of the necessity of prior and universal principles. \"Two and two could then make as well 4 as 6 if \nprior principles did not exist.\"[clarification needed]\nPierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis' and Julien Offray de La Mettrie's references to Du Ch\u00e2telet's deliberations on motion, free will, thinking matter, numbers and the way to do metaphysics are a sign of the importance of her reflections. She rebuts the claim to finding truth by using mathematical laws, and argues against Maupertuis.[19]\n\nWarmth and brightness[edit]\n Dissertation Sur La Nature et La Propagation du feu, 1744\nIn 1737 Ch\u00e2telet published a paper entitled Dissertation sur la nature et la propagation du feu,[20] based upon her research into the science of fire, that predicted what is today known as infrared radiation and the nature of light.[citation needed]\n\nInstitutions de Physique[edit]\nHer book Institutions de Physique[21] (\"Lessons in Physics\") was published in 1740; it was presented as a review of new ideas in science and philosophy to be studied by her 13 year old son, but it incorporated and sought to reconcile complex ideas from the leading thinkers of the time. The book and subsequent debate contributed to her becoming a member of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna in 1746.\n\nForces Vives[edit]\n R\u00e9ponse de Madame la Marquise du Chastelet, 1741\nIn 1741 du Ch\u00e2telet published a book titled R\u00e9ponse de Madame la Marquise du Chastelet, a la lettre que M. de Mairan. Dortous de Mairan, secretary of the Academy of Sciences, had published a set of arguments addressed to her regarding the appropriate mathematical expression for forces vives. Du Ch\u00e2telet presented a spirited point by point rebuttal of de Mairan's arguments, causing him to withdraw from the controversy.[22]\nImmanuel Kant's first publication in 1747 'Gedanken zur wahren Sch\u00e4tzung der lebendigen Kr\u00e4fte' focuses on Du Ch\u00e2telet's pamphlet against the secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, Mairan. Kant's opponent, Johann Augustus Eberhard accused Kant of taking ideas from Du Ch\u00e2telet.[23]\n\nAdvocacy of kinetic energy[edit]\nAlthough in the early 18th century the concepts of force and momentum had been long understood, the idea of energy as transferable between different systems was still in its infancy,  and would not be fully resolved until the 19th Century. It is now accepted that the total mechanical momentum of a system is conserved and none is lost to friction. Simply put, there is no 'momentum friction' and momentum can not transfer between different forms, and particularly there is no potential momentum. Emmy Noether later proved this to be true for all problems where the initial state is symmetric in generalized coordinates. Mechanical energy, kinetic and potential, may be lost to another form, but the total is conserved in time. The Du Ch\u00e2telet contribution was the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. In doing so, she became the first person in history to elucidate the concept of energy as such, and to quantify its relationship to mass and velocity based on her own empirical studies. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by Willem 's Gravesande in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity. The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height the balls were dropped from, equal to the initial potential energy. With the exception of Leibniz, earlier workers like Newton believed that \"energy\" was indistinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped. In classical physics the correct formula is \n\n\n\nE\n=\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nm\n\nv\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E={\\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E}\n\n is the kinetic energy of an object, \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n its mass and \n\n\n\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v}\n\n its speed.  Energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to relate it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat . . .). Newton's work assumed the exact conservation of only mechanical momentum. A broad range of mechanical problems are soluble only if energy conservation is included. The collision and scattering of two point masses is one of them. Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange established a more formal framework for mechanics using the results of du Ch\u00e2telet.[24][25]\n\nTranslation and commentary on Newton's Principia[edit]\nIn 1749, the year of Du Ch\u00e2telet's death, she completed the work regarded as her outstanding achievement: her translation into French, with her commentary, of Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (often referred to as simply the Principia), including her derivation of the notion of conservation of energy from its principles of mechanics. Published ten years after her death, today Du Ch\u00e2telet's translation of the Principia is still the standard translation of the work into French. Her translation and commentary of the Principia contributed to the completion of the scientific revolution in France and to its acceptance in Europe.[26]\n\nOther contributions[edit]\nDevelopment of financial derivatives[edit]\nShe lost the considerable sum for the time of 84,000 francs\u2014some of it borrowed\u2014in one evening at the table at the Court of Fontainebleau, to card cheats.[5][27] To raise the money to pay back her debts she devised an ingenious financing arrangement similar to modern derivatives, whereby she paid tax collectors a fairly low sum for the right to their future earnings (they were allowed to keep a portion of the taxes they collected for the King), and promised to pay the court gamblers part of these future earnings.[5]\n\nBiblical scholarship[edit]\nDu Ch\u00e2telet wrote a critical analysis of the entire Bible. A synthesis of her remarks on the book of Genesis was published in English in 1967 by Ira O. Wade of Princeton in his book Voltaire and Madame du Ch\u00e2telet: An Essay on Intellectual Activity at Cirey and a book of her complete notes was published in 2011, in the original French, edited and annotated by Bertram Eugene Schwarzbach.\n\nDiscourse on happiness[edit]\nDu Ch\u00e2telet wrote a monograph, Discours sur le bonheur, on the nature of happiness both in general and specialised to women.\n\nTranslation of the Fable of the Bees, and other works[edit]\nDu Ch\u00e2telet translated The Fable of the Bees in a free adaptation. She also wrote works on optics, rational linguistics, and the nature of free will.\n\nSupport of women's education[edit]\nIn her first independent work, the preface to her translation of the Fable of the Bees, du Ch\u00e2telet argues strongly for women's education, particularly a strong secondary education as was available for young men in the French coll\u00e8ges. By denying women a good education, she argues, society prevents women from becoming eminent in the arts and sciences.[28]\n\nLegacy[edit]\n Portrait by Marianne Loir. Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux\nDu Ch\u00e2telet made a crucial scientific contribution in making Newton's historic work more accessible in a timely, accurate and insightful French translation, augmented by her own original concept of energy conservation.\nA main-belt minor planet and a crater on Venus have been named in her honor, and she is the subject of three plays: Legacy of Light by Karen Zacar\u00edas; \u00c9milie: La Marquise Du Ch\u00e2telet Defends Her Life Tonight by Lauren Gunderson and Urania: the Life of \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet by Jyl Bonaguro.[29] The opera \u00c9milie of Kaija Saariaho is about the last moments of her life.[30]\nDu Ch\u00e2telet is often represented in portraits with mathematical iconography, such as holding a pair of dividers or a page of geometrical calculations. In the early nineteenth century, a French pamphlet of celebrated women (Femmes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres) introduced a possibly apocryphal story of Du Ch\u00e2telet's childhood.[31]  According to this story, a servant fashioned a doll for her by dressing up wooden dividers as a doll; however, du Ch\u00e2telet undressed the dividers and intuiting their purpose, made a circle with them.\nSince 2016, the French Society of Physics (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Physique) has awarded the Emilie Du Ch\u00e2telet Prize to a physicist or team of researchers for excellence in Physics.\nDuke University also presents an annual Du Ch\u00e2telet Prize in Philosophy of Physics \"for previously unpublished work in philosophy of physics by a graduate student or junior scholar.\"[32]\n\nWorks[edit]\nLibrary resources about  \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet \nResources in your library\nResources in other libraries\n\nBy \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet\nOnline books\nResources in your library\nResources in other libraries\n\nScientific\nDissertation sur la nature et la propagation du feu (1st edition, 1739; 2nd edition, 1744)\nInstitutions de physique (1st edition, 1740; 2nd edition, 1742)\nPrincipes math\u00e9matiques de la philosophie naturelle par feue Madame la Marquise du Ch\u00e2telet (1st edition, 1756; 2nd edition, 1759)\nOther\nExamen de la Gen\u00e8se\nExamen des Livres du Nouveau Testament\nDiscours sur le bonheur\nSee also[edit]\n\n\nBiography portal\nTimeline of women in science\nNotes[edit]\n\n^ The Lomont suffix indicates the branch of the du Chastellet family; another such branch was the du Chastellet-Clemont.\n\n^ The spelling Ch\u00e2telet (replacing the s by a circumflex over the a) was introduced by Voltaire, and has now become standard.
