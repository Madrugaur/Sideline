{"name": "Harald Bohr", "content": "\n Harald August Bohr (22 April 1887 \u2013 22 January 1951) was a Danish mathematician and footballer. After receiving his doctorate in 1910, Bohr became an eminent mathematician, founding the field of almost periodic functions. His brother was the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Niels Bohr. He was a member of the Danish national football team for the 1908 Summer Olympics, where he won a silver medal.[2]\n Bohr was born in 1887 to Christian Bohr, a professor of physiology, from a Lutheran background, and Ellen Adler Bohr, a woman from a wealthy Jewish family of local renown.[3] Harald had a close relationship with his elder brother, which The Times likened to that between Captain Cuttle and Captain Bunsby in Charles Dickens' Dombey and Son.[4]\n Like his father and brother before him, in 1904 Bohr enrolled at the University of Copenhagen, where he studied mathematics, obtaining his master's degree in 1909 and his doctorate a year later. Among his tutors were Hieronymus Georg Zeuthen and Thorvald N. Thiele.[5] Bohr worked in mathematical analysis; much of his early work was devoted to Dirichlet series including his doctorate, which was entitled Bidrag til de Dirichletske R\u00e6kkers Theori (Contributions to the Theory of Dirichlet Series).[6] A collaboration with G\u00f6ttingen-based Edmund Landau resulted in the Bohr\u2013Landau theorem, regarding the distribution of zeroes in zeta functions.[3]\n Bohr worked in mathematical analysis, founding the field of almost periodic functions, and worked with the Cambridge mathematician G. H. Hardy.\n In 1915 he became a professor at Polyteknisk L\u00e6reanstalt (today Technical University of Denmark), working there until 1930, when he took a professorship at the University of Copenhagen. He remained in this post for 21 years until his death in 1951. B\u00f8rge Jessen was one of his students there.\n He was a visiting professor at Stanford University during the academic year 1930\u20131931.[7] He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in the summer of 1948.[8]\n In the 1930s Bohr was a leading critic of the anti-Semitic policies taking root in the German mathematical establishment, publishing an article criticising Ludwig Bieberbach's ideas in Berlingske Aften in 1934.[9]\n Bohr was also an excellent football player. He had a long playing career with Akademisk Boldklub, making his debut as a 16-year-old in 1903.[10] During the 1905 season he played alongside his brother Niels, who was a goalkeeper. Harald was selected to play for the Danish national football team in the 1908 Summer Olympics, where football was an official event for the first time. Though a Danish side had played at the 1906 Intercalated Games, the opening match of the 1908 Olympic tournament was Denmark's first official international football match. Bohr scored two goals as Denmark beat the French \"B\" team 9\u20130.[11] In the next match, the semi-final, Bohr played in a 17\u20131 win against France, which remains an Olympic record.[12] Denmark faced hosts Great Britain in the final, but lost 2\u20130, and Bohr won a silver medal.[3][6] After the Olympics he made one further appearance for the national team, in a 2\u20131 victory against an England amateur team in 1910.[13] His popularity as a footballer was such that when he defended his doctoral thesis the audience was reported as having more football fans than mathematicians.[14]\n Bohr was known as an extremely capable academic teacher and the annual award for outstanding teaching at the University of Copenhagen is called the Harald, in honour of Harald Bohr. With Johannes Mollerup, Bohr wrote an influential four-volume textbook L\u00e6rebog i Matematisk Analyse (Textbook in mathematical analysis).[15]\n Following the murder of Kaj Munk on 4 January 1944 the Danish resistance newspaper De frie Danske brought condemning reactions from influential Scandinavians, including Bohr.[16]\n ", "tags": ["1887 births", "1951 deaths", "20th-century Danish mathematicians", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Danish footballers", "Olympic footballers of Denmark", "Olympic silver medalists for Denmark", "Footballers at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "Denmark international footballers", "Akademisk Boldklub players", "Bohr family", "Olympic medalists in football", "Danish people of Jewish descent", "Medalists at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "Association football midfielders", "Jewish footballers", "Mathematicians involved with Mathematische Annalen", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "CS1 Danish-language sources (da)", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from December 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Pages using national squad without sport or team link", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Danish footballer\n\n\nHarald BohrHarald BohrBornHarald August Bohr(1887-04-22)22 April 1887[1]Copenhagen[1]Died22 January 1951(1951-01-22) (aged\u00a063)GentofteResting placeAssistens Cemetery, CopenhagenNationalityDanishAlma\u00a0materUniversity of CopenhagenOccupationMathematicianParent(s)Christian and Ellen Bohr[1]RelativesNiels Bohr (brother)\n\n\nOlympic medal record\n\n\nRepresenting \u00a0Denmark\n\n\nMen's football\n\n\n\n 1908 London \nTeam Competition\n\nHarald August Bohr (22 April 1887 \u2013 22 January 1951) was a Danish mathematician and footballer.
