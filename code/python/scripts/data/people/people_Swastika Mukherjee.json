She filed a charge against him for cruelty and solicitation of dowry. These charges were subsequently dismissed and Promit was acquitted.[5][6]\n Swastika later filed an affidavit in court stating that her accusations were 'unfounded, false, baseless and speculative,' before confessing in a media conference that they were false.[7] Consequently, Promit's brother sued her for damages in Calcutta High Court and she was held liable for \u20b97.7 crore ($1.7 million).[8] According to Mukherjee, Sen filed for divorce in 2000, but changed his mind when she became successful in her acting career.[5] She had one daughter from the marriage, Anwesha, born in 2000.[9]\n In 2001, Mukherjee enrolled at the Ananda Shankar Centre for Culture, learning dance from veteran Tanusree Shankar.[5] During the filming of Mastan, she began dating her co-star Jeet.[5] They went on to appear in several films together, including Kranti, Krishnakanter Will, and Partner.
