He died in Brussels.\nKra\u00eftchik is famous for having inspired the two envelopes problem in 1953, with the following puzzle in La math\u00e9matique des jeux:\n\nTwo people, equally rich, meet to compare the contents of their wallets. Each is ignorant of the contents of the two wallets. The game is as follows: whoever has the least money receives the contents of the wallet of the other (in the case where the amounts are equal, nothing happens). One of the two men can reason: \"Suppose that I have the amount A in my wallet. That's the maximum that I could lose. If I win (probability 0.5), the amount that I'll have in my possession at the end of the game will be more than 2A. Therefore the game is favourable to me.\" The other man can reason in exactly the same way. In fact, by symmetry, the game is fair. Where is the mistake in the reasoning of each man?[4]\nAmong his publications were the following:\n\nTh\u00e9orie des Nombres, Paris: Gauthier-Villars, 1922\nRecherches sur la th\u00e9orie des nombres, Paris: Gauthier-Villars, 1924\nLa math\u00e9matique des jeux ou R\u00e9cr\u00e9ations math\u00e9matiques, Paris: Vuibert, 1930, 566 pages\nMathematical Recreations, New York: W.
