{"name": "Melvin Hochster", "content": "Melvin Hochster (born August 2, 1943) is an American mathematician working in commutative algebra.  He is currently the Jack E. McLaughlin Distinguished University Professor of Mathematics at the University of Michigan.\n Hochster attended Stuyvesant High School,[1] where he was captain of the Math Team, and received a B.A. from Harvard University.  While at Harvard, he was a Putnam Fellow in 1960.  He earned his Ph.D. in 1967 from Princeton University, where he wrote a dissertation under Goro Shimura characterizing the prime spectra of commutative rings.[2]\n He held positions at the University of Minnesota and Purdue University before joining the faculty at Michigan in 1977.\n Hochster's work is primarily in commutative algebra, especially the study of modules over local rings.  He has established classic theorems concerning Cohen\u2013Macaulay rings, invariant theory and homological algebra.  For example, the Hochster\u2013Roberts theorem states that the invariant ring of a linearly reductive group acting on a regular ring is Cohen\u2013Macaulay.  His best-known work is on the homological conjectures, many of which he established for local rings containing a field, thanks to his proof of the existence of big Cohen\u2013Macaulay modules and his technique of reduction to prime characteristic.  His most recent work on tight closure, introduced in 1986 with Craig Huneke, has found unexpected applications throughout commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.\n He has had more than 40 doctoral students, and the Association for Women in Mathematics has pointed out his outstanding role in mentoring women students pursuing a career in mathematics. He served as the chair of the department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan from 2008 to 2017.\n Hochster shared the 1980 Cole Prize with Michael Aschbacher, received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1981, and has been a member of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1992. In 2008, on the occasion of his 65th birthday, he was honored with a conference in Ann Arbor and with a special volume of the Michigan Mathematical Journal.\n ", "tags": ["Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Algebraists", "Stuyvesant High School alumni", "Harvard University alumni", "Princeton University alumni", "University of Michigan faculty", "Purdue University faculty", "University of Minnesota faculty", "Putnam Fellows", "Living people", "1943 births", "Scientists from New York City", "Mathematicians from New York (state)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "BLP articles lacking sources from February 2013", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nThis biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.
