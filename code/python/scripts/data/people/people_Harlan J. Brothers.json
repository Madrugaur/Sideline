{"name": "Harlan J. Brothers", "content": "Harlan J. Brothers is an inventor, composer, mathematician, and educator based in Branford, Connecticut.\n In 1997, while examining the sequence of counting numbers raised to their own power ( {an}=nn ), Brothers discovered some simple algebraic formulas [1] that yielded the number 2.71828..., the universal constant e, also known as the base of the natural logarithm.  Like its more famous cousin \u03c0, e is a transcendental number that appears in a wide range of formulas in mathematics and physics.\n Having no formal college-level mathematics education, he sent brief descriptions of his findings to the host of the National Public Radio show \"Science Friday\" and also to a well-known mathematician at Scientific American.[2]\n His communication with \"Science Friday\" led to a fruitful collaboration with meteorologist John Knox.  Together they discovered over two dozen new formulas and published two papers on their methods.  These methods subsequently found their way into the standard college calculus curriculum by way of two popular textbooks on the subject.[3][4]\n Brothers went back to school to study calculus and differential equations.  He went on to publish methods for deriving infinite series that include the fastest known formulas for approximating e.[5]\n In the summer of 2001, his professor, Miguel Garcia, introduced him to Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot and Michael Frame at Yale University.
