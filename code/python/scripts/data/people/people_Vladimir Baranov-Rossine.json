From 1903 to 1907 he attended the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg.\n In 1908 he exhibited with the group Zveno (The Link) in Kiev organized by the artist David Burliuk and his brother Wladimir Burliuk.\n In 1910 he moved to Paris, where until 1914 he was a resident in the artist's colony La Ruche together with Alexander Archipenko, Sonia Delaunay-Terk, Nathan Altman and others. He exhibited regularly in Paris after 1911.\n He returned to Russia in 1914. In 1916 he had a solo exhibition in Oslo. In 1918 he had exhibits with the union of artists Mir Iskusstva (World of Art) in Petrograd (St.Petersburg). In the same year, he had an exhibition with the group Jewish Society for the Furthering of the Arts in Moscow, together with Nathan Altman, El Lissitzky and David Shterenberg.

Baranov-Rossine is credited as an author of pointillist and dynamic military camouflage. He also invented a \"photochromometer\" that allowed the determination of the qualities of precious stones. In another field, he perfected a machine that made, sterilized and distributed fizzy drinks, the \"Multiperco\", and this received several technical awards at the time.[1]\n During the German occupation Baranoff-Rossine was deported to Auschwitz, a German concentration camp and murdered there in 1944 by the Nazis.\n ", "tags": ["1888 births", "1944 deaths", "People from Kherson", "People from Khersonsky Uyezd", "Ukrainian Jews", "Soviet emigrants to France", "French people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent", "Russian avant-garde", "20th-century Russian painters", "Russian male painters", "Jewish artists", "Ukrainian artists", "Cubist artists", "Modern artists", "Visual music artists", "Russian inventors", "Jewish inventors", "Vkhutemas faculty", "Camoufleurs", "20th-century inventors", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " Self-Portrait, oil on canvas, 1907, 75 x 50 cm.
