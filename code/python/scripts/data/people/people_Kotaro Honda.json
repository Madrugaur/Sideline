{"name": "Kotaro Honda", "content": "Kotaro Honda (\u672c\u591a \u5149\u592a\u90ce, Honda K\u014dtar\u014d), born on February 23, 1870 in Okazaki, Aichi Prefecture \u2013 February 12, 1954)  was a Japanese scientist and inventor.  He invented KS steel (initials from Kichiei Sumitomo), which is a type of magnetic resistant steel that is three times more resistant than tungsten steel.[1]  This material, which had 250 oersteds magnetic resistance, was developed through rigorous basic research on steel and alloys.[2]\n Honda was born in the town of Yahagi (part of modern Okazaki, Aichi and was a graduate of Tokyo Imperial University. He was taught by the famous Japanese physicist Hantaro Nagaoka at the University of Tokyo. \n Honda's research on KS steel in 1917, and on improved KS steel in 1934 became the basis for his position that Japan's industrial development is dependent on basic research in major scientific fields.[3] He later improved upon the steel, creating NKS steel. This NKS steel was mentioned by Taiichi Ohno in his book, as being one of the Japanese materials development results after the Second world war.[4]\n Honda, together with the academic Tokiatsu Hojo, setup up a research institute, which was supported by the Sumitomo family.[2] It was later renamed Metallic Materials Research Institute.[2] In 1931, he was appointed president of Tohoku Imperial University, where he taught physics for several years.[5]\n He participated in establishing the (\u5343\u8449\u5de5\u696d\u5927\u5b66, Chiba Institute of Technology) from 1940. He served as the first president of the Tokyo University of Science from 1949.\n Honda was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932,[6] and was one of the first persons to be awarded the Order of Culture when it was established in 1937. He was also awarded the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1931 and became a Person of Cultural Merit in 1951. He was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun.  \n Honda died in 1954 in Bunkyo, Tokyo, and his grave is at the temple of Myogen-ji in Okazaki.\n On April 18, 1985, the Japan Patent Office selected him as one of Ten Japanese Great Inventors.[7]\n ", "tags": ["1870 births", "1954 deaths", "People from Okazaki, Aichi", "Japanese inventors", "Japanese metallurgists", "Recipients of the Order of Culture", "University of Tokyo alumni", "Tohoku University faculty", "Riken personnel", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Japanese-language text", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Japanese scientist and inventor\nKotaro Honda\u672c\u591a \u5149\u592a\u90ceKotaro HondaBorn(1870-02-23)February 23, 1870Okazaki, Aichi, JapanDiedFebruary 12, 1954(1954-02-12) (aged\u00a083)Tokyo, JapanResting placeOkazaki, Aichi, JapanNationalityJapaneseAlma\u00a0materUniversity of TokyoKnown\u00a0forKS steel\nKotaro Honda (\u672c\u591a \u5149\u592a\u90ce, Honda K\u014dtar\u014d), born on February 23, 1870 in Okazaki, Aichi Prefecture \u2013 February 12, 1954)  was a Japanese scientist and inventor.
