{"name": "Michael Aizenman", "content": "Michael Aizenman (born 28 August 1945 in Nizhny Tagil, Russia) is an American-Israeli mathematician and a physicist at Princeton University, working in the fields of mathematical physics, statistical mechanics, functional analysis and probability theory.\n The highlights of his work include: the triviality of a class of scalar quantum field theories in more than four dimensions; a description of the phase transition in the Ising model in three and more dimensions; the sharpness of the phase transition in percolation theory; a method for the study of spectral and dynamical localization for random Schr\u00f6dinger operators; and insights concerning conformal invariance in two-dimensional percolation.[1]\n Aizenman is a Jewish[2] American - Israeli who was born in Russia. He was an undergraduate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was awarded his PhD in 1975 at Yeshiva University (Belfer Graduate School of Science), New York City, with advisor Joel Lebowitz. After postdoctoral appointments at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University (1974\u201375), and Princeton University (1975\u20131977), with Elliott H. Lieb, he was appointed Assistant Professor at Princeton. In 1982 he moved to Rutgers University as Associate Professor and then full Professor.  In 1987 he moved to the Courant Institute and in 1990 returned to Princeton as Professor of Mathematics and Physics. He was several times a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study, in 1984-85, 1991\u201392, and 1997\u201398,[3] and is a regular Visiting Scholar at the Weizmann Institute of Science.\n Aizenman received honorary degrees (DHC) from Universit\u00e9 de Cergy-Pontoise (2009) and Technion (2018), and is a member of\nNational Academy of Sciences (1997),   American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2017), and Academia Europea (2016).\n During 2001-2012 he served as the editor-in-chief of Communications in Mathematical Physics.\n ", "tags": ["Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Princeton University faculty", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "21st-century American physicists", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni", "Yeshiva University alumni", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences faculty", "Rutgers University faculty", "Brouwer Medalists", "Mathematical physicists", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences alumni", "1945 births", "Living people", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American-Israeli mathematician\nMichael AizenmanMichael Aizenman in Leiden, June 2019BornMichael Aizenman(1945-08-28)August 28, 1945Nizhny Tagil, RussiaAlma\u00a0mater\nThe Hebrew University\nYeshiva University\nAwards\nBrouwer Medal (2002)\nMember of National Academy of Sciences (1997)\nMember of American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2017)\nScientific careerFields\nMathematical Physics\nMathematics\nFunctional Analysis\nStatistical mechanics\nInstitutions\nPrinceton University\nThesis\u00a0(1975)Doctoral advisor\nJoel Lebowitz\n\nWebsitewww.math.princeton.edu/people/michael-aizenman\nMichael Aizenman (born 28 August 1945 in Nizhny Tagil, Russia) is an American-Israeli mathematician and a physicist at Princeton University, working in the fields of mathematical physics, statistical mechanics, functional analysis and probability theory.\nThe highlights of his work include: the triviality of a class of scalar quantum field theories in more than four dimensions; a description of the phase transition in the Ising model in three and more dimensions; the sharpness of the phase transition in percolation theory; a method for the study of spectral and dynamical localization for random Schr\u00f6dinger operators; and insights concerning conformal invariance in two-dimensional percolation.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Honors and awards\n3 Publications\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nAizenman is a Jewish[2] American - Israeli who was born in Russia.
