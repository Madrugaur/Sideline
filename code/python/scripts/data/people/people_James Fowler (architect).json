{"name": "James Fowler (architect)", "content": "\n James Fowler JP FRIBA (11 December 1828, Lichfield \u2013 10 October 1892, Louth), known as 'Fowler of Louth',[1] is best known as a Victorian English church architect and associated with the restoration and renovation of churches. However, he was also the architect of a wide variety of other buildings. A listing of his work compiled in 1991 traced over 210 buildings that he designed or restored. He is known to be the architect for 24 new churches and his work also included 40 vicarages or rectories, 13 schools, four almshouses, a Savings Bank, a convalescent home and hospital as well as country houses and estate housing. Most of Fowler\u2019s work was in Lincolnshire and particularly around Louth, but it also included work in the East Riding of Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, Suffolk, London, Sussex and even Devon.[2]\n Fowler was born in Lichfield. He was a pupil of Lichfield architect Joseph Potter junior.[3] At Louth he was initially in partnership with Joseph Maughan, a surveyor and lithographer in Grimsby. The partnership lasted from 1851 until June  1859.[4].On dissolution it was agreed that the Surveying Department will hereafter be conducted by Mr. Maughan, and the Architectural Department by Mr. Fowler, at their usual places of business in both towns (Grimsby and Louth).[5]   Fowler had  probably continued the practice of Charles John Carter, a Louth architect and surveyor, who had died in 1851. Fowler was elected FRIBA in 1864. Amongst his pupils was Ernest William Farebrother, an architect who worked in Grimsby.[6]  He was a  Surveyor for the Diocese of Lincoln between 1871 and 1886, and was for five terms the mayor of Louth.[7] The Grimsby architect John James Cresswell worked as an articled assistant and then principal assistant to Fowler  between 1877-84.[8]\n ", "tags": ["1828 births", "1892 deaths", "English ecclesiastical architects", "Architects from Lincolnshire", "19th-century English architects", "People from Lichfield", "People from Louth, Lincolnshire", "Fellows of the Royal Institute of British Architects", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Use British English from September 2014", "Use dmy dates from September 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nJames FowlerJames Fowler memorial, Louth ChurchBorn11 December 1828LichfieldDied10 October 1892LouthNationalityEnglishOccupationArchitect\nJames Fowler JP FRIBA (11 December 1828, Lichfield \u2013 10 October 1892, Louth), known as 'Fowler of Louth',[1] is best known as a Victorian English church architect and associated with the restoration and renovation of churches.
