Panjer in the Statistics and Actuarial Science Department at the University of Waterloo.[7][8]\n Li began his career in finance in 1997 at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in the World Markets division.[2] He moved to New York City in 2000 where he became a partner in J.P.

However, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 the model has been seen as a \"recipe for disaster\".[2] According to Nassim Nicholas Taleb, \"People got very excited about the Gaussian copula because of its mathematical elegance, but the thing never worked.

The mathematics are from established statistical theory, actuarial models, and probability theory. In section 5.4, he uses Gaussian copula to measure event relationships, or mathematically, correlations, between random economic events, expressed as:\n In layman's terms, he proposes there is a relationship between 2 independent but related events i.e. \"House A\" defaulting and \"House B\" defaulting are measurable using correlation. While under some scenarios (such as real estate) this correlation appeared to work most of the time, the underlying problem is that the single numerical data of correlation is a poor way to summarize history, and hence is not enough to predict the future.
