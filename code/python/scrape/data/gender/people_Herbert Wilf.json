{"name": "Herbert Wilf", "content": "Herbert Saul Wilf (June 13, 1931 \u2013 January 7, 2012) was a mathematician, specializing in combinatorics and graph theory.  He was the Thomas A. Scott Professor of Mathematics in Combinatorial Analysis and Computing at the University of Pennsylvania.  He wrote numerous books and research papers. Together with Neil Calkin he founded  The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics in 1994 and was its editor-in-chief until 2001.\n Wilf was the author of numerous papers and books, and was adviser and mentor to many students and colleagues. His collaborators include Doron Zeilberger and Donald Knuth. One of Wilf's former students is Richard Garfield, the creator of the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering. He also served as a thesis advisor for E. Roy Weintraub in the late 1960s.\n Wilf died of a progressive neuromuscular disease in 2012.[1]\n In 1998, Wilf and Zeilberger received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research for their joint paper, \"Rational functions certify combinatorial identities\" (Journal of the American Mathematical Society, 3 (1990) 147\u2013158).  The prize citation reads: \"New mathematical ideas can have an impact on experts in a field, on people outside the field, and on how the field develops after the idea has been introduced.  The remarkably simple idea of the work of Wilf and Zeilberger has already changed a part of mathematics for the experts, for the high-level users outside the area, and the area itself.\" Their work has been translated into computer packages that have simplified hypergeometric summation.\n In 2002, Wilf was awarded the Euler Medal by the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications.\n ", "tags": ["1931 births", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Combinatorialists", "University of Pennsylvania faculty", "2012 deaths", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nHerbert Saul WilfBornJune 13, 1931Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USDiedJanuary 7, 2012(2012-01-07) (aged\u00a080)Wynnewood, PennsylvaniaNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materColumbia UniversityMITKnown\u00a0forCombinatoricsAwardsLeroy P.
