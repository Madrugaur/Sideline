{"name": "Laure Saint-Raymond", "content": "Laure Saint-Raymond (born 1975) is a French mathematician, and a professor of mathematics at \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon. She is known for her work in partial differential equations, and in particular for her contributions to the mathematically rigorous study of the connections between interacting particle systems, the Boltzmann equation, and fluid mechanics. In 2008 she was awarded the European Mathematical Society Prize, with her citation reading:\n Saint-Raymond is well known for her outstanding results on nonlinear partial differential equations in the dynamics of gases and plasmas and also in fluid dynamics. [...] Saint-Raymond is at the origin of several outstanding and difficult results in the field of nonlinear partial differential equations of mathematical physics. She is one of the most brilliant young mathematicians in her generation. Laure Saint-Raymond studied in Paris, entering \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in 1994. In 1996, she received  a Master's degrees in plasma physics from Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University and in applied mathematics from Pierre and Marie Curie University. In 2000 she finished her Ph.D. in applied mathematics at Paris Diderot University, under the supervision of Fran\u00e7ois Golse.\n She worked for two years for the French National Centre for Scientific Research, and was named in 2002 full professor of mathematics at the Pierre and Marie Curie University at the age of 27.
