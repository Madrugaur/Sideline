{"name": "Abraham Sharp", "content": "\n Abraham Sharp (1653 \u2013 18 July 1742) was an English mathematician and astronomer.\n Sharp was born in Horton Hall in Little Horton, Bradford, the son of well-to-do merchant John Sharp and Mary (n\u00e9e Clarkson) Sharp and was educated at Bradford Grammar School.[1]\n In 1669 he became a merchant's apprentice before becoming a schoolmaster in Liverpool and subsequently a bookkeeper in London. His wide knowledge of mathematics and astronomy attracted Flamsteed's attention and it was through Flamsteed that Sharp was invited, in 1688, to enter the Greenwich Royal Observatory. There he did notable work, improving instruments and showing great skill as a calculator, publishing Geometry Improved and logarithmic tables.\n Sharp calculated pi to 72 decimal places using an arctan sequence, briefly holding the record until John Machin calculated 100 digits in 1706.[2]\n He returned to Little Horton in 1694. When the Atlas Coelestis \u2013 the largest star map at the time was published[3] \u2013 it contained 26 maps of the major constellations visible from Greenwich, and two planispheres designed by Sharp.[4]\n Sharp died in Little Horton in 1742. He had never married. He was a great-uncle of Jesse Ramsden, the scientific instrument maker.[5]\n An English translation of a memorial tablet in Latin in Bradford Cathedral carved by Peter Scheemakers[6] translates as \" He was rightly counted among the most accomplished mathematicians of his day.
