{"name": "Johan Petter Johansson", "content": "Johan Petter Johansson (December 12, 1853 \u2013 August 25, 1943), sometimes known as JP, was a Swedish inventor and industrialist. He invented a modern adjustable spanner [1] (patents in 1891 and 11 May 1892). He obtained over 100 patents in total.\n He was born in V\u00e5rg\u00e5rda in western Sweden, the oldest of six children in a crofter's family. His first employment was as an assistant operator of a steam engine at a local peat factory. He left V\u00e5rg\u00e5rda at age 19, in 1873, for Motala to work as a navvy. Following military service in 1874, he moved to Eskilstuna where he worked for the Bolinder-Munktell factory, and in 1878 he moved to V\u00e4ster\u00e5s where he found employment at a mechanical workshop. Following that, he worked as a blacksmith at a nearby farm.\n At this time, he had made a decision to leave Sweden for the United States. This never happened; he was instead offered a more esteemed job by his former employer Munktells, and the offer changed his mind.\n He eventually decided to start his own business and, in 1886, moved to Enk\u00f6ping where he started Enk\u00f6pings Mekaniska Verkstad (the Mechanical Workshop of Enk\u00f6ping) which quickly became a successful venture. It was during the years in his workshop that he invented the adjustable spanner and the plumber wrench. In 1890, B.A. Hjorth & Company agreed to distribute his tools worldwide under the \"Bahco\" trademark. The Bahco tools became greatly successful, and the company is still in operation and has manufactured over 100 million wrenches to date.\n Johansson transferred the then-large enterprise to his son, Hannes Brynge, and the B.A. Hjorth & Company in 1916. He started experimenting with electrical armature and in 1919 opened a new factory, Triplex, which manufactured electrical pendulums and various devices.\n He died 89 years old after having been productive for most of his life.\n ", "tags": ["1853 births", "1943 deaths", "Swedish businesspeople", "Swedish inventors", "Swedish blacksmiths", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Johan Petter JohanssonJ.
