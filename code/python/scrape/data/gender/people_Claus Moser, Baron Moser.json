{"name": "Claus Moser, Baron Moser", "content": "\n Claus Adolf Moser, Baron Moser, KCB, CBE (24 November 1922 \u2013 4 September 2015) was a British statistician who made major contributions in both academia and the Civil Service.[1][2]  He prided himself rather on being a non-mathematical statistician, and said that the thing that frightened him most in his life was when Maurice Kendall asked him to teach a course on analysis of variance at the LSE.[3]\n Claus Adolf Moser was born in Berlin in 1922. His father was Dr Ernst (Ernest) Moser (1885\u20131957), owner of the private bank Georg Fromberg & Co. in Berlin (est. 1882, \"aryanized\" in 1936). His mother was Lotte (n\u00e9e Goldberg, 1897\u20131976), a talented amateur musician. In 1936 he moved to England with his parents and his brother Heinz Peter August. He went to Frensham Heights School and the London School of Economics (LSE). Despite being Jewish, in 1940, he was interned as an enemy alien in Huyton Camp.\n After four months, he was released and served in the Royal Air Force, 1943\u20131946. He then returned to LSE as Assistant Lecturer, then Lecturer, in Statistics, 1946\u20131955; Reader in Social Statistics, 1955\u20131961; Professor of Social Statistics, 1961\u20131970; Visiting Professor of Social Statistics, 1970\u20131975.\n In 1965 he was elected a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.[4]\nHe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1965 New Year Honours,[5] and in 1965, he applied for a job at the Central Statistical Office but was rejected, as a former enemy alien. However, this did not seem to be a problem when in 1967 Harold Wilson appointed him Director of the Central Statistical Office. He was made a Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB) in the 1973 New Year Honours.[6] He resigned as Director of the Central Statistical Office in 1978.\n He held a very wide variety of posts. These included:\n He was made a life peer with the title Baron Moser, of Regent's Park in the London Borough of Camden on 23 June 2001.[8] Other honours included the Albert Medal of the Royal Society of Arts, 1996, Commandeur de l'Ordre National du M\u00e9rite (France), 1976; Commander's Cross, Order of Merit (Germany), 1985.\n Moser also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1995.[9]\n Moser died in Switzerland on 4 September 2015, following a stroke.[10]\n Moser was honorary Chancellor at Keele University at a time of rapid change after funding cuts in the early 80s, and appointment of a full-time vice-chancellor to reduce staff / student ratios further after that first emergency. Keele's funding per student was reduced by a third and Oxford's by a thirtieth from similar amounts per head in the 70s.\n In 1997 Moser participated in a ceremony to mark the start of construction of the Claus Moser Research Centre, a dedicated research facility for the Humanities and Social Sciences.[11] He returned to the university in June 2008 to participate in the official opening of the \u00a33.5m building.[12]\n ", "tags": ["1922 births", "2015 deaths", "People from Berlin", "People educated at Frensham Heights School", "Alumni of the London School of Economics", "Chancellors of Keele University", "Commanders of the Order of the British Empire", "Directors of the Central Statistical Office (United Kingdom)", "Fellows of the American Statistical Association", "Fellows of Nuffield College, Oxford", "Wardens of Wadham College, Oxford", "Pro-Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford", "Fellows of the British Academy", "Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath", "People associated with the Royal Academy of Music", "People's peers", "Presidents of the Royal Statistical Society", "Commanders Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United Kingdom", "Refugees ennobled in the United Kingdom", "Presidents of the British Science Association", "Honorary Fellows of the London School of Economics", "Neurological disease deaths in Switzerland", "N M Rothschild & Sons people", "Pages containing London Gazette template with parameter supp set to y", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Use dmy dates from May 2012", "Use British English from May 2012", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with UKPARL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThe Right HonourableThe Lord MoserKCB CBEDirector of the Central Statistical OfficeIn office1967\u20131978Preceded byHarry CampionSucceeded byJohn Boreham\nPersonal detailsBornClaus Adolf Moser(1922-11-24)24 November 1922Berlin, German ReichDied4 September 2015(2015-09-04) (aged\u00a092)Chur, SwitzerlandCitizenshipBritishNationalityBritishSpouse(s)Mary OxlinEducationFrensham Heights SchoolAlma materLondon School of EconomicsOccupationStatisticianMilitary serviceAllegianceUnited KingdomBranch/serviceRoyal Air ForceYears\u00a0of service1943\u20131946\nClaus Adolf Moser, Baron Moser, KCB, CBE (24 November 1922 \u2013 4 September 2015) was a British statistician who made major contributions in both academia and the Civil Service.[1][2]  He prided himself rather on being a non-mathematical statistician, and said that the thing that frightened him most in his life was when Maurice Kendall asked him to teach a course on analysis of variance at the LSE.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 The Claus Moser Research Centre\n3 See also\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nLife[edit]\nClaus Adolf Moser was born in Berlin in 1922.
