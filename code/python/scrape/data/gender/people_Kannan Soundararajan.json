{"name": "Kannan Soundararajan", "content": "Kannan Soundararajan (born December 27, 1973)[citation needed] is a mathematician and a professor of mathematics at Stanford University. Before moving to Stanford in 2006, he was a faculty member at University of Michigan where he pursued his undergraduate studies. His main research interest is in analytic number theory, particularly in the subfields of automorphic L-functions, and multiplicative number theory.\n Soundararajan grew up in Madras and was a student at Padma Seshadri High School in Nungambakkam in Madras. In 1989, he attended the prestigious Research Science Institute. He represented India at the International Mathematical Olympiad in 1991 and won a Silver Medal.\n Soundararajan joined the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1991 for undergraduate studies, and graduated with highest honours in 1995. Soundararajan won the inaugural Morgan Prize in 1995 for his work in analytic number theory whilst an undergraduate at the University of Michigan,[1] where he later served as professor. He joined Princeton University in 1995 and did his Ph.D under the guidance of Professor Peter Sarnak.  \n After his Ph.D. he received the first five-year fellowship from the American Institute of Mathematics, and held positions at Princeton University, the Institute for Advanced Study, and the University of Michigan. He moved to Stanford University in 2006 where he is currently[when?] a Professor of Mathematics and the Director of the Mathematics Research Center (MRC) at Stanford.\n He proved a conjecture of Ron Graham in combinatorial number theory jointly with Ramachandran Balasubramanian. He made important contributions in settling the arithmetic Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture for Maass wave forms and modular forms.\n He received the Salem Prize in 2003 \"for contributions to the area of Dirichlet L-functions and related character sums\". In 2005, he won the $10,000 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize, shared with Manjul Bhargava, awarded by SASTRA in Thanjavur, India, for his outstanding contributions to number theory.[2] In 2011, he was awarded the Infosys science foundation prize.[3] He was awarded the Ostrowski prize[4] in 2011, shared with lb Madsen and David Preiss, for a cornucopia of fundamental results in the last five years to go along with his brilliant earlier work.\n He gave an invited talk at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2010, on the topic of \"Number Theory\".[5] In July 2017, Soundararajan was a plenary lecturer in the Mathematical Congress of the Americas.[6] He was elected to the 2018 class of fellows of the American Mathematical Society.[7]\n Soundararajan resides in Palo Alto, California with his wife and son, who is a student at the University of Southern California.[citation needed]\n ", "tags": ["1973 births", "Living people", "Indian emigrants to the United States", "Indian number theorists", "University of Michigan alumni", "Stanford University Department of Mathematics faculty", "American people of Indian descent", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Recipients of the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize", "International Mathematical Olympiad participants", "University of Michigan faculty", "21st-century Indian mathematicians", "Simons Investigator", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from November 2019", "Articles needing additional references from November 2019", "All articles needing additional references", "All articles with vague or ambiguous time", "Vague or ambiguous time from November 2019", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Kannan SoundararajanSoundararajan teaching at Stanford UniversityBorn (1973-12-27) December 27, 1973 (age\u00a047)NationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Michigan Princeton UniversityAwardsOstrowski Prize (2011) Infosys Prize (2011) SASTRA Ramanujan Prize (2005)Salem Prize (2003)Morgan Prize (1995)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsStanford University University of MichiganDoctoral advisorPeter SarnakDoctoral studentsMaksym Radziwill\n\nKannan Soundararajan (born December 27, 1973)[citation needed] is a mathematician and a professor of mathematics at Stanford University.
