Construction began in 1832 with Lennox supervising the efforts of twenty convicts who had little, if any, masonry skills. Lennox Bridge is the oldest surviving complete bridge on the Australian mainland (it is predated by Richmond Bridge in Tasmania, completed 1825, and by the foundations of several bridges north of Wisemans Ferry including Clares Bridge on the Great North Road, built in 1830).[5]\n1832-1835 \u2013 Lansdowne Bridge\nLennox was also responsible for the construction of historic Lansdowne Bridge over Prospect Creek which he was enlisted to build in 1832, with construction beginning the very next year using locally quarried stone.[1] After three years, it was opened in January 1836 and with a toll charged for crossing, the construction costs were soon recovered.[1]\n1836 \u2013 Liverpool Dam\nLennox oversaw the construction of the Liverpool Dam, one of the first engineered weirs built in New South Wales,[6] which both supplied water to the town of Liverpool and served as a causeway across the Georges River. Constructed under the supervision of Capt. Christie of the 80th Regiment; assistant engineer and superintendent of Ironed Gangs in the Town of Liverpool.\n The Lennox Bridge over the Parramatta River opened in 1839.\n1836-1839 \u2013 Lennox Bridge, Parramatta\nDesigned in 1835 as an elliptical arch of 90 feet (27\u00a0m) span, the bridge over the Parramatta River at Parramatta was ultimately built as a simple stone arch spanning 80 feet (24\u00a0m) and having a width of 39 feet (12\u00a0m). Construction began in November 1836, using the centring from the Lansdowne Bridge, adjusted to the new span, and the work was finished in 1839.[7] It was named Lennox Bridge by the Parramatta Council some 28 years later.[4]\n1839 \u2013 Parramatta Boundary Markers\nLennox oversaw the installation of 9 carved stones which marked the former parish boundaries of Parramatta. Of the original 9, 4 can still be seen in their original locations.[8]\n1844-1853 \u2013 Lennox built fifty-three bridges in the nine years he was in the employ of Victoria,[4] including the second Prince's Bridge over the Yarra River in Melbourne. The 46 metres (151\u00a0ft) stone arch was the largest built by Lennox and was opened in 1851.[4][9] It was to last until the river was widened some thirty-five years later, and in 1888 was replaced by the present Prince's Bridge. It is possible that he designed Towrang Bridge (1839) that once carried the Hume Highway.\nAs well as bridges, Lennox was also in charge of roads, wharves and ferries in the Port Phillip district.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"Lansdowne Bridge over Prospect Creek\".
