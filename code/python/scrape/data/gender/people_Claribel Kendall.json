Kendall also went on to receive her master's degree in 1914 with a focus in mathematics. She studied mathematics in an era when women were increasingly seeking a college education and slowly beginning to move into math and science,\u00a0fields that had traditionally been exclusively male.[1] Her master's thesis was on \u201cPre Associative Syzygies in Linear Algebra.\" Kendall earned a BA and B.Ed. in 1912 and an MA in 1914 from the University of Colorado.[2] Her master's thesis was called \"Preassociative syzygies in linear algebra\".\n While completing her master's degree, Kendall began teaching in the mathematics department at the University of Colorado in 1913. After receiving her master's degree, she began to work towards her doctorate. Kendall entered the University of Chicago as a student and spent several summers between 1915-1918 there*. In 1920 she received a fellowship from the University of Chicago to aid in the completion of her degree. She received her Ph.D from the University of Chicago in January 1922.[3] Kendall wrote her doctoral thesis on \u201cCertain Congruences Determined by a Given Surface\u201d, under Professor  Ernest Julius Wilczynski. Kendall's work went on to be published in the American Journal of Mathematics in 1923.\n Kendall taught at the University of Colorado* from 1913 until her retirement in 1957, being promoted to full professor by 1944. Kendall directed ten master's theses at Colorado; eight of which were by women.\u00a0 Kendall was a member of the Christian Science Church. Kendall was also Secretary of the University of California chapter of Phi Beta Kappa for over 30 years. Kendall was also a contributor to the solutions of problems in the American Mathematical Monthly.\n Kendall was the first member of the department to receive the Robert L. Stearns Award[4] from the University of Colorado, Boulder for \u201coutstanding service or achievement\u201d.
