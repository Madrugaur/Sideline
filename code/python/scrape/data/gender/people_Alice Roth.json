{"name": "Alice Roth", "content": "Alice Roth (6 February 1905 \u2013 July 1977)[1] was a Swiss mathematician who invented the Swiss cheese set and made significant contributions to approximation theory. She was born, lived and died in Bern, Switzerland.\n Alice attended the H\u00f6here T\u00f6chterschule of Z\u00fcrich, a municipal school for higher education for girls. After graduation in 1924 she studied mathematics, physics and astronomy at ETH Zurich under George P\u00f3lya. She graduated with a diploma in 1930. Her Master's thesis was titled \"Extension of Weierstrass's Approximation Theorem to the complex plane and to an infinite interval\". After that, she was a teacher at multiple high schools for girls in the Zurich area while continuing working with P\u00f3lya at ETH. In 1938 she became the second woman to graduate with a PhD from ETH[2] Her PhD Thesis was titled \"Properties of approximations and radial limits of meromorphic and entire functions\" and was so well regarded that it received a monetary prize and the ETH silver medal. Her supervisors were P\u00f3lya and Heinz Hopf.\n From 1940 she was mathematics and physics teacher at Humboldtianum in Bern, a private school. It was only after her retirement in 1971 that she returned to mathematical research, again in the area of complex approximation. She published three papers on her own, as well as a shared paper with Paul Gauthier of the University of Montreal and Harvard University professor Joseph L. Walsh. In 1975, at the age of 70, she was invited to give a public lecture at the University of Montreal.\n In 1976 she was diagnosed with cancer, and she died the next year.\n One of the main results of Roth's 1938 thesis was an example of a compact set on which not every continuous function can by approximated uniformly by rational functions. This set, now known as the \"Swiss cheese,\"[3] was forgotten and independently rediscovered in 1952 in Russia by Mergelyan, and proper credit was restored by 1969.\n The following excerpt by her former student, Peter Wilker, appeared in an obituary he wrote after her death:\n\"In Switzerland, as elsewhere, women mathematicians are few and far between....
