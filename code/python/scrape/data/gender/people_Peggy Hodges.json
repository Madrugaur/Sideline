{"name": "Peggy Hodges", "content": "\n Peggy Lilian Hodges OBE FRAeS FIMA (11 June 1921 \u2013 21 November 2008)[1] was a British engineer who worked on guided missile technology at GEC Marconi.\n Hodges was born in Lewisham,[2] south east London on 11 June 1921 before moving to Westcliff-on-Sea where she was educated at Westcliff High School for Girls. Hodges read Natural Sciences at Girton College, Cambridge and graduated with an Honours degree in 1942.[3]\n After graduation Hodges began her career at Standard Telephone and Cables (STC) as a Junior Radio Engineer in the Radio Division, where she worked on airborne communications and the ILS blind beacon landing equipment.[4]\n In 1950 Hodges joined the GEC Applied Electronics Laboratories at Stanmore, Middlesex, where she worked as a microwave and systems engineer, working on guided weapons. Hodges became Systems Manager and then Project Manager of the Guided Weapons Project (Sea Dart Guidance) in the Guided Weapons Division. Among other projects, Hodges worked in the Underwater Weapons Division on trials planning and analysis for air-launched guided torpedoes, and later worked on simulation, identifying problems affecting guided weapons systems. She was finally appointed Simulation Manager.\n After her retirement in 1981, Hodges returned to professional work as a general systems consultant in the Guided Weapons Division of Marconi Space and Defence Systems (MSDS),Stanmore. Hodges was President of the Caroline Haslett Trust, which encourages young women to enter the engineering profession.[5] It was natural, with her interest in encouraging women into engineering, that she should be a Soroptimist. She was a member of SI St Albans and District.\n Hodges was an active member of the Women's Engineering Society, which she joined in 1960. She held various offices including Member of Council and Careers Officer, and was President of WES[6] in 1971-3. In 1979 Hodges gave the WES Verena Holmes Lecture[7] entitled \u2018Control \u2013 Feedback completes the circle\u2019.\n In 1969 Hodges was elected a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, one of three women Fellows at the time, and was also a member of the Astronautics and Guided Flight Committee. She was a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) and a member of its Council from 1971-73. Between 1971-75 Hodges was a member of the Engineering Design Advisory Committee (EDAC) and a member of the Science Research Council Control and Instrumentation Sub-Committee between 1980 and 1982. She was elected an Honorary Fellow of the IEEIE (now part of the Institution of Engineering and Technology[8]) in 1994.\n Hodges won the Whitney Straight Award in 1970 for outstanding achievement in aviation which was presented by Prince Charles and in the same year appeared in a TV film \u2018Made In Britain\u2019 concerned with a \u201cWoman in a Man\u2019s World\u201d. She was awarded an OBE in the 1972 Birthday Honours for her contribution to guided weapons technology.\n Hodges' personal papers are deposited in the IET Archives.[9]\n A legacy in Hodges will enabled the establishment of the Peggy Hodges Prize, which was awarded to the highest performing female student in second year exams at the University of Hertfordshire's MEng/BEng degree.[10]\n \n ", "tags": ["1921 births", "2008 deaths", "Officers of the Order of the British Empire", "People educated at Westcliff High School for Girls", "Alumni of Girton College, Cambridge", "Scientists from London", "British women engineers", "20th-century women engineers", "Fellows of the Royal Aeronautical Society", "Presidents of the Women's Engineering Society", "Women's Engineering Society", "Women engineers", "Systems engineers", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "EngvarB from May 2016", "Articles with hCards", "Use dmy dates from May 2016", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "British engineer\n\n\nPeggy HodgesBornPeggy Lilian Hodges(1921-06-11)11 June 1921London, England, United KingdomDied(2008-11-21)21 November 2008Buckinghamshire, England, United KingdomNationalityBritishEducationGirton College, CambridgeOccupationEngineer, mathematician, physicistKnown\u00a0forGuided weapons technologyAwardsWhitney Straight Award 1970\nOBE 1972\nPeggy Lilian Hodges OBE FRAeS FIMA (11 June 1921 \u2013 21 November 2008)[1] was a British engineer who worked on guided missile technology at GEC Marconi.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Engineering career\n3 Retirement and later work\n4 Work for the Women's Engineering Society\n5 Awards and recognition\n6 Legacy\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nHodges was born in Lewisham,[2] south east London on 11 June 1921 before moving to Westcliff-on-Sea where she was educated at Westcliff High School for Girls.
