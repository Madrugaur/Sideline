{"name": "Peter Cr\u00fcger", "content": "Peter Cr\u00fcger or Peter Kr\u00fcger (20 October 1580 \u2013 6 June 1639) was a  mathematician, astronomer, polymath, and teacher of Johannes Hevelius.\n Cr\u00fcger was born in K\u00f6nigsberg, Duchy of Prussia, a fief of the Kingdom of Poland.\n In scientific documents published in Latin, his common name Kr\u00fcger (German for potter or innkeeper)[1] was Latinized and spelled Cr\u00fcger. (Compared to the frequency of the family name Kr\u00fcger, the name Cr\u00fcger is relatively uncommon.)\n Cr\u00fcger studied at the universities in K\u00f6nigsberg, Leipzig and Wittenberg, graduating from Wittenberg in 1606. Among his teachers were Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler. He then moved to the city of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk) in the Kingdom of Poland, where he worked for the rest of his life as a professor of poetry and mathematics at the Danziger Akademikum (Danzig Academy).\n As a philosopher and poet, Cr\u00fcger was associated with the poet Johannes Plavius, who in his Institutio Poetica mentions Cr\u00fcger in the opening letter. Cr\u00fcger dedicated an extremely laudatory poem to Plavius, which appears in the preface to Plavius' Praecepta logicalia.\n At the time of the Thirty Years' War a number of Silesians took refuge in Danzig from the ravages of war in their towns, among them Andreas Gryphius, who, when he studied at the Danzig academy from 1634 to 1636, had Cr\u00fcger as a teacher[2] and was very much influenced by the famous mathematician and astronomer. Professors Cr\u00fcger and Mochingert made Gryphius aware of the new style of German-language poetry. Gryphius wrote memorial verses, when in 1638 Cr\u00fcger's child died. Years earlier Cr\u00fcger had already developed a great friendship with Martin Opitz, \"father of German poetry\", who also lived in Danzig.\n Cr\u00fcger published treatises on many scientific subjects and contributed to the progress of trigonometry, geography and astronomy, and to the development of astronomical instruments. In the years 1627 to 1630, Cr\u00fcger was the teacher of a teenager of the Hewelke family who would become known later as Johannes Hevelius, the astronomer. After Hevelius had returned to Danzig in 1634, the dying Cr\u00fcger appealed[3][4] to him to pursue astronomy. Hevelius gratefully mentions Cr\u00fcger in his Machina coelestis.[5]\n He died in Danzig.\n The crater Cr\u00fcger on the Moon is named after him.\n ", "tags": ["1580 births", "1639 deaths", "People from Prussia", "17th-century German mathematicians", "German poets", "17th-century astronomers", "People from K\u00f6nigsberg", "People from the Duchy of Prussia", "German scientific instrument makers", "University of K\u00f6nigsberg alumni", "Leipzig University alumni", "University of Wittenberg alumni", "German male poets", "17th-century German male writers", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with Latin-language sources (la)", "Articles with German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For the Belgian film director, see Peter Kr\u00fcger (film director).\n Cr\u00fcger's Azimuthal Quadrant, completed by Johannes Hevelius 1644 (the observer is Hevelius)\nPeter Cr\u00fcger or Peter Kr\u00fcger (20 October 1580 \u2013 6 June 1639) was a  mathematician, astronomer, polymath, and teacher of Johannes Hevelius.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 See also\n3 Notes\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nLife[edit]\nCr\u00fcger was born in K\u00f6nigsberg, Duchy of Prussia, a fief of the Kingdom of Poland.\nIn scientific documents published in Latin, his common name Kr\u00fcger (German for potter or innkeeper)[1] was Latinized and spelled Cr\u00fcger.
