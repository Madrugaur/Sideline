{"name": "Hidetsugu Yagi", "content": "Hidetsugu Yagi (\u516b\u6728 \u79c0\u6b21, Yagi Hidetsugu, January 28, 1886 \u2013 January 19, 1976) was a Japanese electrical engineer from Osaka, Japan. When working at Tohoku University, he wrote several articles that introduced a new antenna designed by his colleague Shintaro Uda to the English-speaking world.\n The Yagi antenna, patented in 1926, allows directional communication using electromagnetic waves, and is now installed on millions of houses throughout the world for radio and television reception.[citation needed]  He also tried, unsuccessfully, to introduce a wireless power transmission system.[citation needed] He participated in establishing the Chiba Institute of Technology.[1][citation needed]\n He was the fourth president of Osaka University from February 1946 to December 1946.[2]\n In 1942, he became Director of the Industrial Sciences Faculty of the Tokyo University, in 1944 he became General Director of the Technology Institute, and in 1946 also General Director of the Osaka Imperial University. He was decorated with the Medal of Honor with Blue Ribbon Award in 1951, with the Order of Culture in 1956, and posthumously with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1976.[citation needed]\n Hidetsugu Yagi was born on January 28, 1886, in Osaka Prefecture. He graduated from the Department of Electronic Engineering of the Tokyo Imperial University, Faculty of Sciences, in 1909. From 1913 he studied in Germany where he worked with Heinrich Barkhausen on generating CW oscillations by electric arcs; England where he worked with J.A. Fleming who invented the vacuum diode; and the United States where he worked with J.A. Fleming at Harvard who invented the Pierce oscillator which generated a continuous wave. He earned the doctorate from Tokyo Imperial University in 1921[3] Germany he continued research on generation of electric waves used for wireless communication. He returned to Japan in 1930.[citation needed]\nAfter 1930, Hidetsugu Yagi was involved, as a contractor, in the operation of the Number Nine Research Laboratory run by Iwakuro Hideo.[4]\n The topic of wireless communication, which he pursued during his studies abroad, would become a research theme to which he would dedicate his entire life. In 1919, he became a professor at the Faculty of Engineering Sciences of the Tohoku Imperial University which was then established and during the same year, he also attained the title of Doctor of Engineering. He was able to foresee that short waves or ultra-short waves would become the main element for communication using radio waves and he aimed his research in this direction. This resulted in the publication of his papers called \"Generation of Short Wavelength Waves\", \"Measuring Specific Wavelengths with Short Wavelengths\", and other papers. The so-called Yagi antenna is based on these published articles. He invented it as an antenna using his \"method for directional electric waves\". He obtained the patent rights to his invention (patent number 69115, issued in 1926).\n Because this invention uses a very simple construction, it enabled directional communication with electric waves. This construction is still used basically in any type of antenna which is used today for ultra short or extremely short waves.\n On April 18, 1985, the Japan Patent Office selected him as one of Ten Japanese Great Inventors.[5]\n On January 28, 2016, Google published an animated Google Doodle to honor his work.[6]\n ", "tags": ["1886 births", "1976 deaths", "Japanese electrical engineers", "Japanese inventors", "Japanese scientists", "Amateur radio people", "University of Tokyo alumni", "Osaka University faculty", "Tokyo Institute of Technology faculty", "Recipients of the Order of Culture", "Tohoku University faculty", "20th-century inventors", "Valdemar Poulsen Gold Medal recipients", "Microwave engineers", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles needing additional references from September 2012", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Japanese-language text", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from May 2012", "Articles with unsourced statements from June 2020", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2014", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This biography needs additional citations for verification.

The longer reflector element (left), the driven element (center), and the shorter director (right) each have a so-called trap (parallel LC circuit) inserted along their conductors on each side, allowing the antenna to be used at two different frequency bands.\n Six rooftop Yagi\u2013Uda television antennas in Israel. The Yagi\u2013Uda design is widely used at VHF and UHF frequencies, since at these wavelengths, the lengths of the elements are conveniently small.\nThe topic of wireless communication, which he pursued during his studies abroad, would become a research theme to which he would dedicate his entire life. In 1919, he became a professor at the Faculty of Engineering Sciences of the Tohoku Imperial University which was then established and during the same year, he also attained the title of Doctor of Engineering.
