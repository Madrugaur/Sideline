{"name": "Mary Anderson (inventor)", "content": "Mary Elizabeth Anderson (February 19, 1866 \u2013 June 27, 1953)[1] was an American real estate developer, rancher, viticulturist and inventor of the windshield wiper blade. On November 10, 1903 Anderson was granted her first patent[2] for an automatic car window cleaning device controlled from inside the car, called the windshield wiper.[3]\n Mary Anderson was born in Burton Hill Plantation, Greene County, Alabama, at the start of Reconstruction in 1866. Her parents are John C. and Rebecca Anderson. Anderson was one of at least two daughters. The other daughter was Fannie who remained close to Anderson all her life. Their father died in 1870, and the young family was able to live on the proceeds of John\u2019s estate. In 1889 she moved with her widowed mother and sister to the booming town of Birmingham, Alabama. Anderson\u2019s education is unknown, she was never married and didn\u2019t have any children.[4][5]\n In Birmingham, Anderson became a real estate developer soon after settling and built the Fairmont Apartments on Highland Avenue. In 1893, Anderson left Birmingham to operate a cattle ranch and vineyard in Fresno, California . In 1898, she returned to Birmingham to help care for an ailing aunt. Anderson and her aunt moved into the Fairmont Apartments with Anderson\u2019s mother, her sister Fannie, and Fannie\u2019s husband G. P. Thornthon. Anderson\u2019s ailing aunt brought a trunk with her that contained a collection of gold and jewelry. From that time forward, Anderson\u2019s family lived comfortably.[5]\n In a visit to New York City in the winter of 1903, in a  trolley car on a frosty day, Anderson observed that the trolley car driver struggled to see past the windows because of the falling sleet.[6] The trolley car\u2019s front window was designed for bad-weather visibility, but its multi-pane windshield system worked very poorly.[7] Therefore, to clear the sights, the driver needed to open the window, lean out of the vehicle, or to stop the car to go outside in order to wipe the windscreen with his hands. Anderson, who was not an engineer, but an entrepreneur, identified the problem and its opportunity. She envisioned a windshield wiper blade that could be operated from the inside by the trolley driver.[8] At that time, it rarely occurred to anyone else to eliminate the problem. It was something drivers simply accepted and dealt with. \n When she returned to Alabama she hired a designer for a hand-operated device to keep a windshield clear and had a local company produce a working model. She applied for, and in 1903 was granted, a 17-year patent for a windshield wiper.[1] The patent application was filed on June 18, 1903. On November 10, 1903, the United States Patent Office awarded Anderson patent number 743,801 for her Window Cleaning device.[9]\n Her device consisted of a lever inside the vehicle that controlled a rubber blade on the outside of the windshield. The lever could be operated to cause the spring-loaded arm to move back and forth across the windshield. A counterweight was used to ensure contact between the wiper and the window.[10][11] The device could be easily removed if desired after the winter was over.[12] Similar devices had been made earlier, but Anderson's was the first windshield clearing device to be effective. Anderson\u2019s simple mechanism and basic design have remained much the same, but today\u2019s windscreen wipers\u2019 significant difference is that Anderson\u2019s wipers could have been removed when not needed.[11]\n In 1903, when Anderson applied for the patent, cars were not very popular. Henry Ford\u2019s Model A automobile had not even been manufactured yet.[11] Therefore, when Anderson tried to sell the rights to her invention through a noted Canadian firm of Dinning and Eckenstein in 1905, they rejected her application. They argued, \"we do not consider it to be of such commercial value as would warrant our undertaking its sale.\" Furthermore, many could not see the value of her invention and stressed the risk that the driver would be distracted by operating the device and the moving wipers.\n After the patent expired in 1920 and the automobile manufacturing business grew exponentially, windshield wipers using Anderson's basic design became standard equipment.[citation needed] In 1922, Cadillac became the first car manufacturer to adopt them as standard equipment.[10]\n In 1922, driving became more popular and there was nothing yet on personal operated vehicles to clean their windshield. Cadillac thought they should take Anderson's invention on street cars and apply it to their own motor operated vehicles. So they did, Cadillac began to put windshield wipers on their personal vehicles as a standard.\n In 1917, Charlotte Bridgewood patented the \u201celectric storm windshield cleaner,\u201d the first automatic wiper system that used rollers instead of blades.[13][14] Like Anderson, Bridgewood never made any money from her invention.[iii] Sara-Scott Wingo, rector of Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Richmond, Va., and Anderson\u2019s great-great niece, suspects that Anderson\u2019s invention never went anywhere because Anderson was an independent woman. Wingo said in an interview with NPR News, \u201cShe didn't have a father. She didn't have a husband. And the world was kind of run by men back then.\u201d[15]\n By the 1920s, Anderson\u2019s brother-in-law had died, and Anderson was again living in the Fairmont Apartments in Birmingham with her sister Fannie and her mother.[i] She continued to manage the Fairmont Apartments until her death at the age of 87. At the time of her death, she was the oldest member of South Highland Presbyterian Church.[5] She died at her summer home in Monteagle, Tennessee. Her funeral was conducted by Dr. Frank A Mathes at South Highland and she was buried at Elmwood Cemetery.[1]\n Anderson's invention of the windshield wiper is mentioned in Season 17, Episode 19: \"Girls Just Want to Have Sums,\" of the cartoon The Simpsons, during a debate between Marge Simpson and her husband and son, Homer and Bart, about gender equality:\n Anderson's windshield wiper invention is also briefly mentioned on the British panel/quiz show; QI (Quite Interesting); Season 10, Episode 16 - \"Just the Job\".\n \"When was the windshield wiper invented?\" was the Weather Channel \"Question of the Day\" for July 6, 2016.\n NPR's Morning Edition produced a profile, including an interview with her great-great-niece into her legacy and societal context on July 25, 2017. [15]\n Mary Anderson\u2019s legacy, the windshield wipers, was adapted for automotive use and became a car\u2019s standard equipment when Cadillac began installing them in 1922. However, Anderson did not receive any money for her invention. In 2011, she was inducted into the International Inventors Hall of Fame, receiving some credit she truly deserved.[17]\n ", "tags": ["1866 births", "1953 deaths", "People from Greene County, Alabama", "20th-century American inventors", "Viticulturists", "Businesspeople from Birmingham, Alabama", "People from Monteagle, Tennessee", "Women inventors", "American automotive pioneers", "Burials at Elmwood Cemetery (Birmingham, Alabama)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 maint: extra text: authors list", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2009", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American inventor (1866\u20131953)\nMary AndersonBornMary AndersonFebruary 19, 1866Greene County, AlabamaDiedJune 27, 1953(1953-06-27) (aged\u00a087)Monteagle, TennesseeOccupationReal Estate Developer, rancher, viticulturist, InventorKnown\u00a0forThe Windshield Wiper (invented 1902, patented 1903)\nMary Elizabeth Anderson (February 19, 1866 \u2013 June 27, 1953)[1] was an American real estate developer, rancher, viticulturist and inventor of the windshield wiper blade.
