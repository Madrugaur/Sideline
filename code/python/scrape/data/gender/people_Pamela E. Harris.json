Her PhD dissertation was advised by Jeb F. Willenbring.[7] Harris was a Project NExT (New Experiences in Teaching) fellow in 2012.[8] She was a Davies Research Fellow at the United States Military Academy,[3][5] and, in 2016, joined the faculty at Williams College[9][5] where she is now an associate professor.[10]\n Harris studies algebraic combinatorics, in particular the representation of Lie algebras.[5] In order to understand this representation she studies vector partition functions, in particular Kostant's partition function.[3] She is also interested in graph theory and number theory.[9]  In 2016 she co-founded an online platform called 'Lathisms' which aims to promote the contributions of Latinxs and Hispanics in the Mathematical Sciences.[1][3] In 2020 she co-authored the book \"Asked and Answered: Dialogues On Advocating For Students of Color in Mathematics\".[11] Harris, along with Aris Winger, run a podcast, Mathematically Uncensored, through the Center for Minorities in the Mathematical Sciences.\u00a0Starting in October 2020, they discussed current issues in mathematics that minorities encounter.[12]\n In 2020, Harris was selected as part of the inaugural class of Karen EDGE Fellows.[13] In 2019, Harris won the Mathematical Association of America Henry L.
