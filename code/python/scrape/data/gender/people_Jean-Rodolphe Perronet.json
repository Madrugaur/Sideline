{"name": "Jean-Rodolphe Perronet", "content": "\n Jean-Rodolphe Perronet (27 October 1708 \u2013 27 February 1794) was a French architect and structural engineer, known for his many stone arch bridges. His best known work is the Pont de la Concorde (1787).\n Perronet was born in Suresnes, a suburb of Paris, the son of a Swiss Guardsman. At age 17 he entered the architectural practice of Jean Beausire, \"first architect\" to the city of Paris, as an apprentice. He was put in charge of the design and construction of Paris's grand sewer, embankment works and the maintenance of the banlieue's roads. In 1735, he was named sous-ing\u00e9nieur (under-engineer) to Alen\u00e7on and in 1736 entered the Corps des ponts et chauss\u00e9es. In 1737, he became sous-ing\u00e9nieur, then engineer to the g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 of Alen\u00e7on.\n In 1747, Perronet was named director of the Bureau des dessinateurs du Roi (Royal office of designers), which had also just put Daniel-Charles Trudaine in charge of producing maps and plans for the kingdom. This first \u00c9cole des ponts et chauss\u00e9es was based in the h\u00f4tel Lib\u00e9ral Bruant in Paris. Perronet was given the task of training bridge and road engineers and of overseeing their work in the g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9s in which they worked. The Bureau became the Bureau des \u00e9l\u00e8ves des ponts et chauss\u00e9es, then in 1775 was renamed the \u00c9cole des ponts et chauss\u00e9es. Its organiser, inspiration and teacher, Perronet was a true spiritual father to his students and used a new teaching method which seems very contemporary to modern eyes. During this time he became friends with the Swiss bridge-builder Charles Labelye.\n He was named premier ing\u00e9nieur du roi in 1763 and became a member of the associate of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences in 1765. Besides his bridges, between 1747 and 1791, 2500\u00a0km of roads were created or repaired under his direction. He also contributed the article Pompe \u00e0 feu (fire-engine) to the Encyclop\u00e9die ou Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers.[1]\n In 1772, Perronet was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.  He died in Paris, aged 85. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1788.[2]\n He died on 27 February 1794 in Paris, aged 85. The street next to the site of the \u00c9cole des ponts et chauss\u00e9es (delimiting Paris's 6th and 7th arrondissements) is now named after him and a statue of him has been erected on the northeast corner of the \u00cele de Puteaux, at the foot of the pont de Neuilly (whose first stone version, built in 1772 and surviving until 1942, was his work).\n French sculptor Adrien \u00c9tienne Gaudez created a monumental statue of Perronet that is erected at the northeast end of Puteaux Island on the Seine River near Paris.\n ", "tags": ["1708 births", "1794 deaths", "People from Suresnes", "18th-century French architects", "French bridge engineers", "Structural engineers", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Acad\u00e9mie royale d'architecture", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Contributors to the Encyclop\u00e9die (1751\u20131772)", "French male non-fiction writers", "18th-century French male writers", "EngvarB from July 2017", "Use dmy dates from July 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with French-language sources (fr)", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DSI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with suppressed authority control identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nJean-Rodolphe PerronetJean-Rodolphe PerronetBorn27 October 1708SuresnesDied27 February 1794\u00a0(1794-02-28) (aged\u00a085)ParisNationalityFrenchOccupationEngineerEngineering careerProjectsPont de la ConcordeSignificant advancearch bridges\n\nJean-Rodolphe Perronet (27 October 1708 \u2013 27 February 1794) was a French architect and structural engineer, known for his many stone arch bridges.
