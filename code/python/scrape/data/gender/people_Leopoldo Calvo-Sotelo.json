{"name": "Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo", "content": "\n Leopoldo Ram\u00f3n Pedro Calvo-Sotelo y Bustelo, 1st Marquess of R\u00eda de Ribadeo (Spanish pronunciation:\u00a0[leo\u02c8poldo \u02c8kal\u03b2oso\u02c8telo i \u03b2us\u02c8telo]; 14 April 1926 \u2013 3 May 2008), usually known as Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, was Prime Minister of Spain between 1981 and 1982.\n Calvo-Sotelo was born into a prominent political family in Madrid on 14 April 1926 with his father, Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo,[1] and his mother, Mercedes Bustelo M\u00e1rquez.[2] The assassination of his uncle, Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo, who had been finance minister under Miguel Primo de Rivera, was a key event leading up to the Spanish Civil War.[2] Calvo-Sotelo graduated as a civil engineer from the School of Civil Engineers of Madrid now part of the Technical University of Madrid, working in the area of applications of chemistry to the industry.[2]\n He was the president of RENFE (the Spanish national railroad network) between 1967 and 1968. Calvo-Sotelo was elected solicitor (Deputy) of Franco's Cortes, representing industrialists in the Union of Chemical Industries, in 1971.[2] A monarchist, Sotelo was one of the founders of an association of politicians, mostly of Rightists and Center Rightists, which disguised as the Fedisa publishing firm helped Spain's peaceful transition into democracy.[2]\n Calvo-Sotelo was designated Minister of Commerce by Carlos Arias Navarro to be in the first government of the Monarchy (December 1975 \u2013 July 1976).[2] He advocated a true transition to democracy instead of mere superficial changes that politicians like Navarro planned.[2] Calvo-Sotelo was kept in the cabinet of Adolfo Su\u00e1rez upon his succession to premiership in 1976 and directed several centre-right and centre-left political associations into one party, the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD).[2] The UCD won in both the June 1977 and the March 1979 elections[2] and Calvo-Sotelo was elected MP for Madrid.\n Su\u00e1rez decided to keep him in the Cabinet, first from 1978 to 1980 as Minister for Relations of the European Economic Community, then as Second Vicepresident in charge of economic affairs.[2] After the resignation of Su\u00e1rez on 29 January 1981, he was supposed to be appointed Prime Minister (Presidente del Gobierno) on 23 February, and advocated Spain's proposed entry into NATO as soon as possible.[2] However, on that date a session of the Congress of Deputies was interrupted by the attempted coup of 23-F.[2] After the failed coup, his appointment as Prime Minister was confirmed on 25 February by the vote of all the UCD members of the congress and 21 others as well, giving him a majority of 186 to 158.[2] Splits in the UCD group led to the formation of three rival parties, the Democratic Action Party (Partido de Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica/PAD), which soon merged with the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), the Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) and Democratic Popular Party (PDP), resulting in the UCD being unable to count on sufficient support in the legislature. Fresh elections were called, resulting in a heavy defeat for the UCD, which won only 12 seats at the 1982 election compared to 168 in 1979. He served as Prime Minister until 1 December 1982 and was succeeded by the socialist Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez.[2]\n In 2002, Calvo-Sotelo was raised into the Spanish nobility by King Juan Carlos of Spain and given the hereditary title of Marqu\u00e9s de la R\u00eda de Ribadeo (Marquess of R\u00eda de Ribadeo), together with the dignity Grande de Espa\u00f1a (English: Grandee of Spain), this in honour for his service.[3][4]\n Calvo-Sotelo was also a member of the Club of Madrid[5] and of the Spanish Royal Academy of Engineering.\n He died of natural causes at his home in Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n, on 3 May 2008 aged 82.[6]\n He was married to Mar\u00eda del Pilar Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez-Mart\u00edn y Mellado and had eight children: \n  Media related to Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo at Wikimedia Commons\n ", "tags": ["1926 births", "2008 deaths", "Spanish monarchists", "Deputy Prime Ministers of Spain", "Economy and finance ministers of Spain", "Grandees of Spain", "Marquesses of Spain", "Members of the constituent Congress of Deputies (Spain)", "Members of the 1st Congress of Deputies (Spain)", "Members of the 2nd Congress of Deputies (Spain)", "MEPs for Spain 1986\u20131987", "Politicians from Madrid", "Polytechnic University of Madrid alumni", "Prime Ministers of Spain", "Spanish Roman Catholics", "Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain) politicians", "CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)", "Use dmy dates from October 2012", "Articles containing Spanish-language text", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThe Most ExcellentLeopoldo Calvo-SoteloPrime Minister of SpainIn office25 February 1981\u00a0\u2013 1 December 1982MonarchJuan Carlos IDeputyRodolfo Mart\u00edn Villa Juan Antonio Garc\u00eda D\u00edezPreceded byAdolfo Su\u00e1rezSucceeded byFelipe Gonz\u00e1lezSecond Deputy Prime Minister of SpainIn office9 September 1980\u00a0\u2013 25 February 1981Prime MinisterAdolfo Su\u00e1rezPreceded byFernando Abril MartorellSucceeded byJuan Antonio Garc\u00eda D\u00edezMinister of EconomyIn office9 September 1980\u00a0\u2013 25 February 1981Prime MinisterAdolfo Su\u00e1rezPreceded byFernando Abril MartorellSucceeded byJos\u00e9 Luis Leal MaldonadoMinister for Relations with the European CommunitiesIn office25 February 1978\u00a0\u2013 9 September 1980Prime MinisterAdolfo Su\u00e1rezPreceded byOffice createdSucceeded byEduard PunsetMinister of Public WorksIn office4 July 1976\u00a0\u2013 April 1977Prime MinisterAdolfo Su\u00e1rezPreceded byAntonio Vald\u00e9sSucceeded byLuis Ortiz Gonz\u00e1lezMinister of TradeIn office13 December 1975\u00a0\u2013 6 July 1976Prime MinisterCarlos Arias NavarroPreceded byJos\u00e9 Luis Cer\u00f3n AyusoSucceeded byJos\u00e9 Llad\u00f3Member of the Congress of DeputiesIn office22 July 1977\u00a0\u2013 31 August 1982ConstituencyMadridIn office28 July 1983\u00a0\u2013 23 April 1986ConstituencyMadrid\nPersonal detailsBornLeopoldo Ram\u00f3n Pedro Calvo-Sotelo y Bustelo(1926-04-14)14 April 1926Madrid, SpainDied3 May 2008(2008-05-03) (aged\u00a082)Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n, SpainResting placeRibadeo Cemetery, Galicia, SpainNationalitySpanishPolitical partyUnion of the Democratic Centre(1977-1983)Spouse(s)Mar\u00eda del Pilar Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez-Mart\u00edn MelladoChildrenLeopoldo (b. 1957)Juan (b. 1958)Mar\u00eda del Pilar (b. 1959)Pedro (b. 1960)V\u00edctor Mar\u00eda (b. 1961)Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda (b. 1964)Andr\u00e9s (b. 1965)Pablo (b. 1965)Signature\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Calvo-Sotelo and the second or maternal family name is  Bustelo.\nLeopoldo Ram\u00f3n Pedro Calvo-Sotelo y Bustelo, 1st Marquess of R\u00eda de Ribadeo (Spanish pronunciation:\u00a0[leo\u02c8poldo \u02c8kal\u03b2oso\u02c8telo i \u03b2us\u02c8telo];
