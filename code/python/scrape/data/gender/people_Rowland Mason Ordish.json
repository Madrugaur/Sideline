He worked with Charles (later Sir Charles) Fox, who was responsible for the construction of Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London in 1851. He subsequently supervised its re-erection in Sydenham, south London.[5]\n His other projects included:\n In 1858 Ordish patented a bridge suspension system, which he later used in the design of bridges across several European rivers that include  Neva at St Petersburg. The system, which consists of a rigid girder suspended by inclined straight chains, was known as Ordish's straight-chain suspension system.[5]\n The Ordish\u2013Lefeuvre Principle is named after him and his partner William Henry Le Feuvre (1832? \u2013\u00a0?) from Jersey (together the pair submitted plans for the department store De Gruchy's in St Helier, Jersey).[10]\n \n This article about a civil engineering topic is a stub.
