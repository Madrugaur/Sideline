{"name": "Shou-Wu Zhang", "content": "Shou-Wu Zhang (Chinese: \u5f20\u5bff\u6b66; pinyin: Zh\u0101ng Sh\u00f2uw\u01d4; born October 9, 1962) is a Chinese-American mathematician known for his work in number theory and arithmetic geometry. He is currently a Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University.\n Shou-Wu Zhang was born in Hexian, Ma'anshan, Anhui, China on October 9, 1962.[1][2][3] Zhang grew up in a poor farming household and could not attend school until eighth grade due to the Cultural Revolution.[1] He spent most of his childhood raising ducks in the countryside and self-studying mathematics textbooks that he acquired from sent-down youth in trades for frogs.[1][2] By the time he entered junior high school at the age of fourteen, he had self-learned calculus and had become interested in number theory after reading about Chen Jingrun's proof of Chen's theorem which made substantial progress on Goldbach's conjecture.[1][2][4]\n Zhang was admitted to the Sun Yat-sen University chemistry department in 1980 after scoring poorly on his mathematics entrance examinations, but he later transferred to the mathematics department after feigning color blindness and received his bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1983.[5][1][2][3][4][6] He then studied under analytic number theorist Wang Yuan at the Chinese Academy of Sciences where he received his master's degree in 1986.[1][4][3][6] In 1986, Zhang was brought to the United States to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia University by Dorian M. Goldfeld.[1][2] He then studied under Goldfeld, Herv\u00e9 Jacquet, Lucien Szpiro, and Gerd Faltings, and then completed his PhD at Columbia University under Szpiro in 1991.[7][1][2][4][3][6]\n Zhang was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study and an assistant professor at Princeton University from 1991 to 1996.[3][6] In 1996, Zhang moved back to Columbia University where he was a tenured professor until 2013.[1][5][3][6] He has been a professor at Princeton University since 2011[5][6] and was the Henry Burchard Fine Professor from 2014 to 2015.[8]\n Zhang is on the editorial boards of: Acta Mathematica Sinica, Algebra & Number Theory, Forum of Mathematics, Journal of Differential Geometry, National Science Review, Pure and Applied Mathematics Quarterly, Science in China, and Research in Number Theory.[5] He has previously served on the editorial boards of: Journal of Number Theory, Journal of the American Mathematical Society, Journal of Algebraic Geometry, and International Journal of Number Theory.[5]\n Zhang's doctoral thesis Positive line bundles on Arithmetic Surfaces (Zhang\u00a01992) proved a Nakai\u2013Moishezon type theorem in intersection theory using a result from differential geometry already proved in Tian Gang's doctoral thesis.[5] In a series of subsequent papers (Zhang\u00a01993, 1995a, 1995b, Szpiro, Ullmo & Zhang\u00a01997), he further developed his theory of 'positive line bundles' in Arakelov theory which culminated in a proof (with Emmanuel Ullmo) of the Bogomolov conjecture (Zhang\u00a01998).[5]\n In a series of works in the 2000s (Zhang\u00a02001b, 2004, Yuan, Zhang & W. Zhang\u00a02009), Zhang proved a generalization of the Gross\u2013Zagier theorem from elliptic curves over rationals to modular abelian varieties of GL(2) type over totally real fields.[5] In particular, the latter result led him to a proof of the rank one Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for modular abelian varieties of GL(2) type over totally real fields through his work relating the N\u00e9ron\u2013Tate height of Heegner points to special values of L-functions in (Zhang\u00a01997, 2001a).[5][9] Eventually, Yuan, Zhang, and W. Zhang\u00a0(2013) established a full generalization of the Gross\u2013Zagier theorem to all Shimura curves.\n In arithmetic dynamics, Zhang\u00a0(1995a, 2006) posed conjectures on the Zariski density of non-fibered endomorphisms of quasi-projective varieties and Ghioca, Tucker, and Zhang\u00a0(2011) proposed a dynamical analogue of the Manin\u2013Mumford conjecture.[10][5]\n In 2018, Yuan and Zhang\u00a0(2018) proved the averaged Colmez conjecture which was shown to imply the Andr\u00e9\u2013Oort conjecture for Siegel modular varieties by Jacob Tsimerman.[11]\n Zhang has received a Sloan Foundation Research Fellowship (1997) and a Morningside Gold Medal of Mathematics (1998). He is also a Clay Foundation Prize Fellow (2003), Guggenheim Foundation Fellow (2009), Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2011), and Fellow of the American Mathematical Society (2016).[12][13][5] He was also an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1998.[14][5][6][15]\n ", "tags": ["1962 births", "Living people", "21st-century mathematicians", "Arithmetic geometers", "Columbia University alumni", "Columbia University faculty", "Educators from Anhui", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Mathematicians from Anhui", "People from Ma'anshan", "Princeton University faculty", "Sun Yat-sen University alumni", "Tsinghua University faculty", "Chinese emigrants to the United States", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Chinese-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "The native form of this personal name is Zhang Shou-Wu.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nShou-Wu ZhangShou-Wu Zhang in 2014Born (1962-10-09) October 9, 1962 (age\u00a058)Hexian, Anhui, ChinaNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materColumbia UniversityChinese Academy of SciencesSun Yat-sen UniversityKnown\u00a0forArakelov theoryArithmetic dynamicsBogomolov conjectureGross\u2013Zagier theoremAwards\nList of Awards\nSloan Fellowship (1997)Morningside Medal (1998)Clay Prize Fellow (2003)Guggenheim Fellow (2009)American Academy of Arts and Sciences Fellow (2011)American Mathematical Society Fellow (2016)\nScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsPrinceton UniversityColumbia UniversityInstitute for Advanced StudyThesisPositive Line Bundles on Arithmetic Surfaces\u00a0(1991)Doctoral advisorLucien SzpiroOther\u00a0academic advisorsWang YuanDoctoral studentsWei ZhangXinyi YuanTian YeYifeng LiuOther\u00a0notable studentsBhargav BhattInfluencesGerd FaltingsDorian M.
