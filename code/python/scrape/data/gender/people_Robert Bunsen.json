{"name": "Robert Bunsen", "content": "\n Robert Wilhelm Eberhard Bunsen (German: [\u02c8b\u028anz\u0259n]; \n30 March 1811[a]\n\u2013 16 August 1899) was a German chemist. He investigated emission spectra of heated elements, and  discovered caesium (in 1860) and rubidium (in 1861) with the physicist Gustav Kirchhoff.[11] The Bunsen\u2013Kirchhoff Award for spectroscopy is named after Bunsen and Kirchhoff.[citation needed]\n Bunsen also developed several gas-analytical methods, was a pioneer in photochemistry, and did early work in the field of organoarsenic chemistry. With his laboratory assistant Peter Desaga, he developed the Bunsen burner, an improvement on the laboratory burners then in use.\n Robert Bunsen was  born in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany in 1811, in what is now the state of Lower Saxony in Germany. Bunsen was the youngest of four sons of the University of G\u00f6ttingen's chief librarian and professor of modern philology, Christian Bunsen (1770\u20131837).[5]\n After attending school in Holzminden, Bunsen matriculated at G\u00f6ttingen in 1828 and studied chemistry with Friedrich Stromeyer as well as mineralogy with Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann and mathematics with Carl Friedrich Gauss.[5] After obtaining a PhD in 1831, Bunsen spent 1832 and 1833 traveling in France, Germany, and Austria. During his journeys, Bunsen met the scientists Friedlieb Runge (who discovered aniline and in 1819 isolated caffeine), Justus von Liebig in Giessen, and Eilhard Mitscherlich in Bonn.[5]\n In 1833 Bunsen became a lecturer at G\u00f6ttingen and began experimental studies of the (in)solubility of metal salts of arsenous acid. His discovery of the use of iron oxide hydrate as a precipitating agent led to what is still today the most effective antidote against arsenic poisoning. This interdisciplinary research was carried on and published in conjunction with the physician Arnold Adolph Berthold.[12][13] In 1836, Bunsen succeeded Friedrich W\u00f6hler at the Polytechnic School of Kassel (German: Baugewerkschule Kassel). Bunsen taught there for three years, and then accepted an associate professorship at the University of Marburg, where he continued his studies on cacodyl derivatives. He was promoted to full professorship in 1841. While at University of Marburg, Bunsen participated in the 1846 expedition for the investigation of Iceland's volcanoes.[14]\n Bunsen's work brought him quick and wide acclaim, partly because cacodyl, which is extremely toxic and undergoes spontaneous combustion in dry air, is so difficult to work with. Bunsen almost died from arsenic poisoning, and an explosion with cacodyl cost him sight in his right eye. In 1841,[15] Bunsen created the Bunsen cell battery, using a carbon electrode instead of the expensive platinum electrode used in William Robert Grove's electrochemical cell. Early in 1851 he accepted a professorship at the University of Breslau, where he taught for three semesters.[citation needed]\n In late 1852 Bunsen became the successor of Leopold Gmelin at the University of Heidelberg. There he used electrolysis to produce pure metals, such as chromium, magnesium, aluminium, manganese, sodium, barium, calcium, and lithium. A long collaboration with Henry Enfield Roscoe began in 1852, in which they studied the photochemical formation of hydrogen chloride (HCl) from hydrogen and chlorine. From this work, the reciprocity law of Bunsen and Roscoe originated. He discontinued his work with Roscoe in 1859 and joined Gustav Kirchhoff to study emission spectra of heated elements, a research area called spectrum analysis. For this work, Bunsen and his laboratory assistant, Peter Desaga, had perfected a special gas burner by 1855, which was influenced by earlier models. The newer design of Bunsen and Desaga, which provided a very hot and clean flame, is now called simply the \"Bunsen burner\", a common laboratory equipment.[16][17]\n There had been earlier studies of the characteristic colors of heated elements, but nothing systematic. In the summer of 1859, Kirchhoff suggested to Bunsen that he should try to form prismatic spectra of these colors. By October of that year the two scientists had invented an appropriate instrument, a prototype spectroscope. Using it, they were able to identify the characteristic spectra of sodium, lithium, and potassium. After numerous laborious purifications, Bunsen proved that highly pure samples gave unique spectra. In the course of this work, Bunsen detected previously unknown new blue spectral emission lines in samples of mineral water from D\u00fcrkheim. He guessed that these lines indicated the existence of an undiscovered chemical element. After careful distillation of forty tons of this water, in the spring of 1860 he was able to isolate 17\u00a0grams of a new element. He named the element \"caesium\", after the Latin word for deep blue. The following year he discovered rubidium, by a similar process.[18][19][20]\n In 1860, Bunsen was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[citation needed]\n In 1877, Robert Bunsen together with Gustav Robert Kirchhoff were the first recipients of the prestigious Davy Medal \"for their researches and discoveries in spectrum analysis\".[21]\n Bunsen was one of the most universally admired scientists of his generation. He was a master teacher, devoted to his students, and they were equally devoted to him. At a time of vigorous and often caustic scientific debates, Bunsen always conducted himself as a perfect gentleman, maintaining his distance from theoretical disputes. He much preferred to work quietly in his laboratory, continuing to enrich his science with useful discoveries. As a matter of principle he never took out a patent. He never married.[2][22]\n Despite his lack of pretension, Bunsen was a vivid \"chemical character\", had a well-developed sense of humor, and is the subject of many amusing anecdotes.[23]\n When Bunsen retired at the age of 78, he shifted his work solely to geology and mineralogy, interests which he had pursued throughout his career. He died in Heidelberg, Germany on 16 August 1899, at the age of 88.[24][25]\n ", "tags": ["1811 births", "1899 deaths", "19th-century German chemists", "Battery inventors", "Caesium", "Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "German inventors", "Heidelberg University faculty", "Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences", "People from G\u00f6ttingen", "People from the Kingdom of Hanover", "People of the Industrial Revolution", "Rare earth scientists", "Recipients of the Copley Medal", "Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)", "Rubidium", "Spectroscopists", "University of Breslau faculty", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "University of Marburg faculty", "Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from The American Cyclopaedia", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from The American Cyclopaedia with a Wikisource reference", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Use dmy dates from August 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from August 2020", "Articles containing German-language text", "Articles with unsourced statements from April 2011", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2011", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nRobert BunsenBornRobert Wilhelm Eberhard Bunsen(1811-03-30)30 March 1811G\u00f6ttingen, Westphalia, Rhine ConfederationDied16 August 1899(1899-08-16) (aged\u00a088)Heidelberg, Baden, German EmpireAlma\u00a0materUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenKnown\u00a0for\nDiscovery of cacodyl radical\nDiscoveries of caesium and rubidium\nDiscovery of use of the Bunsen burner\nCarbon-zinc electrochemical cell\nMethods of gas analysis\nDevelopment of spectrochemical analysis\nAwards\nCopley medal (1860)\nDavy Medal (1877)\nAlbert Medal (1898)\nScientific careerFields\nChemistry (career)\nGeology and mineralogy (retirement)\nInstitutions\nPolytechnic School of Kassel\nUniversity of Marburg\nUniversity of Heidelberg\nUniversity of Breslau\nDoctoral advisorFriedrich StromeyerDoctoral students\nAdolf von Baeyer\nHans Goldschmidt\nFritz Haber\nPhilipp Lenard\nGeorg Ludwig Carius\nHermann Kolbe\nAdolf Lieben\nCarl Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig\nViktor Meyer\nLothar Meyer\nFriedrich Konrad Beilstein\nHenry Enfield Roscoe\nJohn Tyndall\nEdward Frankland\nThomas Edward Thorpe\nFrancis Robert Japp\nOther\u00a0notable students\nDmitri Mendeleev\nJulia Lermontova\n\n\nRobert Wilhelm Eberhard Bunsen (German: [\u02c8b\u028anz\u0259n]; \n30 March 1811[a]\n\u2013 16 August 1899) was a German chemist.

His parish register, as well as two curricula vitae handwritten by Bunsen himself, support the claim that 30 March 1811 is Bunsen's true birth date;[1][2][3][4] however, many later sources cite 31 March as the date.[5][6][7][8][9][10] According to his biographer Georg Lockemann, Bunsen himself celebrated his birthday on the 31st in his later years. Lockemann nevertheless regarded the 30th as the correct date.[4]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Martin Quack (2011). \"Wann wurde Robert Wilhelm Bunsen geboren?\". Bunsen-Magazin.
