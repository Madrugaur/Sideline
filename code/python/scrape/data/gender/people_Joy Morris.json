{"name": "Joy Morris", "content": "Joy Morris (born 1970)[1] is a Canadian mathematician whose research involves group theory, graph theory, and the connections between the two through Cayley graphs.[2] She is also interested in mathematics education, is the author of two open-access undergraduate mathematics textbooks, and oversees a program in which university mathematics education students provide a drop-in mathematics tutoring service for parents of middle school students.
