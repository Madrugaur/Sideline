{"name": "Alessandro Galilei", "content": "Alessandro Maria Gaetano Galilei (25 August 1691 \u2013 21 December 1737) was an Italian mathematician, architect and theorist, a member of the same patrician family of Galileo.\n Born in Florence, he received architectural and engineering training from Antonio Maria Ferri, an outstanding figure of the Accademia dei Nobili, who lectured and wrote a treatise on perspective, fortifications and artillery. With him young Galilei worked on the study of building techniques, stereometry, hydraulics.[1]\n Visiting English milords were impressed with the classicism of his early designs, and he was invited by a party of English to London in 1714. There he participated in a variety of architectural projects, most notably collaborating with the civic engineer Nicholas Dubois. The only other notable Italian architect in London at the time was Giacomo Leoni. The two architects shared a classicising bent that appealed to the English but was at odds with current Baroque architectural practice in Italy. Nevertheless, aside from a funerary monument, no major commissions were forthcoming.\n In 1718, Robert, Viscount Molesworth employed Galilei in Ireland. There, when William Conolly, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons and the richest man in Ireland was just beginning to build Castletown House, near Dublin in County Kildare, he met Galilei. Galilei designed the fa\u00e7ade of the main block of Castletown, the grandest Palladian house in Ireland, but returned to Italy in 1719 and was not associated with the actual construction of the house, which was begun in 1722 and carried through by the young Anglo-Irish architect Edward Lovett Pearce, who met Galilei in Florence while he was making drawings of Palladio's villas on his tour of Italy. and would  introduce Neo-Palladian architecture in Ireland. A portrait of Galilei by Giuseppe Berti, signed and dated 1735, has recently been purchased for Castletown House.\n Once more in Florence after 1719, Galilei was appointed Ingegnere delle fortezze e fabbriche di corte (\"Engineer of court buildings and fortresses\")  of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany, Cosimo III and Gian Gastone de' Medici, last of the Medici grand dukes, neither of whom, however, could provide him with architectural projects suited to his talents. Galilei's projects during this period included a renovation of the choir of Cortona Cathedral that featured a severely classical triumphal arch motif, additions to the Villa Venuti, at Catrosse, near Cortona, for Domenico Girolamo Venuti, and a design (1724) for the oratory of the Church of the Madonna del Vivaio (since rebuilt) in Scarperia, Tuscany.[2]\n In 1730 the Florentine patrician Lorenzo Corsini was elected as Pope Clement XII and called Galilei to Rome in 1731 to build his family's chapel, the Cappella Corsini in the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano (completed 1732).  During the next six years, Galilei created all of his most notable works, which were executed in a Classical, anti-Baroque style. The most notable of these was the fa\u00e7ade of San Giovanni in Laterano, a commission awarded after a competition (1733\u20131736). The monumental severity and palace character of the fa\u00e7ade caused a scandal in Roman artistic circles[3] but was admired later in the century by French and British neoclassicists.\n Galilei also built the more conventionally Baroque fa\u00e7ade for San Giovanni dei Fiorentini (1734), where the cornice between lower and upper stages breaks forward at center and ends, and niches between engaged Corinthian columns and sculptural detail all provide the Baroque light-and-shade.\n He died in Rome.\n ", "tags": ["1691 births", "1737 deaths", "Architects from Florence", "18th-century Italian mathematicians", "Scientists from Florence", "Galilei family", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Alessandro GalileiBorn(1691-08-25)25 August 1691Florence, ItalyDied21 December 1737(1737-12-21) (aged\u00a046)Rome, ItalyNationalityItalianScientific careerFieldsArchitecture, mathematics\n\nAlessandro Maria Gaetano Galilei (25 August 1691 \u2013 21 December 1737) was an Italian mathematician, architect and theorist, a member of the same patrician family of Galileo.\n\nBiography[edit]\nBorn in Florence, he received architectural and engineering training from Antonio Maria Ferri, an outstanding figure of the Accademia dei Nobili, who lectured and wrote a treatise on perspective, fortifications and artillery.
