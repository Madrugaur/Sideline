While working in National Accounts Division, he developed a \u2018Guide to Government Budget Analysis and Preparation of Accounts\u2019 for the general government sector. As Chief Director, in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, under him, a Web based Health Management Information System (HMIS) was developed to increase the flow and use of information at all levels.

It was thought to be better to have one comprehensive survey instead of four fragmented ones, the new version of NFHS will not compromise of any indicators that were mapped in other surveys. We have asked the census commissioner to come out with district-level infant, under-5 and maternal mortality once in three years.\"[3]\n Given the dismal Child Sex Ratio in the country, and the Supreme Court directive of 2003 to State governments to enforce the law banning the use of sex determination technologies, the Ministry set up a National Inspection and Monitoring Committee (NIMC) in October last. Rattan Chand, Director (PNDT) was made the convenor of the NIMC. The NIMC under the guidance of Rattan Chand conducted raids in some of the districts in Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Gujarat.
