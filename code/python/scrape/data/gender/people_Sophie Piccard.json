{"name": "Sophie Piccard", "content": "\n Sophie Piccard (1904\u20131990) was a Russian-Swiss mathematician who became the first female full professor (professor ordinarius) in Switzerland.[1][2] Her research concerned set theory, group theory, linear algebra, and the history of mathematics.[1]\n Piccard was born on September 27, 1904 in Saint Petersburg, with a French Huguenot mother and a Swiss father.

Soon afterwards she moved to Switzerland with her parents, escaping the unrest in Russia that her mother, Eulalie Piccard, would become known for writing about.
