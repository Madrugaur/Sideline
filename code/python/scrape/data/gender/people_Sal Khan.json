{"name": "Sal Khan", "content": "\n \n Salman \"Sal\" Khan (born October 11, 1976) is an educator and the founder of Khan Academy, a free online education platform and an organization with which he has produced over 6,500 video lessons teaching a wide spectrum of academic subjects, originally focusing on mathematics and sciences.[1] He is also the founder of Khan Lab School, a brick-and-mortar school associated with Khan Academy.[2]\n As of February\u00a02021[update], the Khan Academy channel on YouTube has 6.4 million subscribers and Khan Academy videos have been viewed more than 1.7 billion times.[3] In 2012, Time named Khan in its annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[4] In the same year, Forbes magazine featured Khan on its cover, with the story \"$1 Trillion Opportunity\".[5]\n Salman Khan was born in Metairie, Louisiana, to a Bengali family.[6] His father was from Barisal, Bangladesh and his mother was from Murshidabad, India.[6][7] He attended Grace King High School, where, as he recalls, \"a few classmates were fresh out of jail and others were bound for top universities.\"[8] He also worked as a cartoonist for the high school's newspaper.[9] Khan took upper-level mathematics courses at the University of New Orleans while he was in high school and graduated valedictorian in 1994.[10][11]\n Khan attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating with Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Course 6 (electrical engineering and computer science), and another bachelor's degree in Course 18 (mathematics), in 1998.[12] He was class president in his senior year.[13]\n Khan also holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Harvard Business School.[14][15][16]\n In 2002, Khan was a summer intern at PARC. From 2003 to late 2009, Khan worked as a hedge fund analyst at Connective Capital Management.[17][18][19]\n In 2004, Khan began tutoring his cousin, Nadia, in mathematics over the internet using Yahoo!'s Doodle notepad.[20] When other relatives and friends sought his tutoring, he moved his tutorials to YouTube, where he created an account on November 16, 2006.[21]\n The popularity of his educational videos on the video-sharing website prompted Khan to quit his job as a financial analyst in late 2009.[22] He moved his focus to developing his YouTube channel, Khan Academy, full-time with the aid of close friend Josh Gefner.[17] Khan consequently received sponsorship from Ann Doerr, the wife of John Doerr.[23]\n His videos received worldwide interest from both students and non-students, with more than 458 million views in the first number[quantify] of years.[22]\n Khan outlined his mission as to \"accelerate learning for students of all ages.
