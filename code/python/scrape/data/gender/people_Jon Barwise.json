{"name": "Jon Barwise", "content": "Kenneth Jon Barwise (/\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0rwa\u026az/; June 29, 1942\u00a0\u2013 March 5, 2000)[1] was an American mathematician, philosopher and logician who proposed some fundamental revisions to the way that logic is understood and used.\n Born in Independence, Missouri to Kenneth T. and Evelyn Barwise, Jon was a precocious child.\n A pupil of Solomon Feferman at Stanford University, Barwise started his research in infinitary logic. After positions as assistant professor at Yale University and the University of Wisconsin, during which time his interests turned to natural language, he returned to Stanford in 1983 to direct the Center for the Study of Language and Information.  He began teaching at Indiana University in 1990. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999.[2]\n Barwise contended that, by being explicit about the context in which a proposition is made, the situation, many problems in the application of logic can be eliminated. He sought ... to understand meaning and inference within a general theory of information, one that takes us outside the realm of sentences and relations between sentences of any language, natural or formal. In particular, he claimed that such an approach resolved the liar paradox. He made use of Peter Aczel's non-well-founded set theory in understanding \"vicious circles\" of reasoning.\n Barwise, along with his former colleague at Stanford John Etchemendy, was the author of the popular logic textbook Language, Proof and Logic. Unlike the Handbook of Mathematical Logic, which was a survey of the state of the art of Mathematical logic c. 1975, and of which he was the editor, this work targeted elementary logic.  The text is notable for including computer-aided homework problems, some of which provide visual representations of logical problems.  During his time at Stanford, he was also the first Director of the Symbolic Systems Program, an interdepartmental degree program focusing on the relationships between cognition, language, logic, and computation. The K. Jon Barwise Award for Distinguished Contributions to the Symbolic Systems Program has been given periodically since 2001.[3]\n ", "tags": ["1942 births", "2000 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "20th-century American non-fiction writers", "20th-century American philosophers", "20th-century essayists", "20th-century philosophers", "American logicians", "American male essayists", "American male non-fiction writers", "American philosophers", "American philosophy academics", "Deaths from colorectal cancer", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Indiana University faculty", "Mathematical logicians", "Mathematicians from Missouri", "Philosophers of logic", "Philosophers of mathematics", "Philosophy writers", "Stanford University alumni", "Stanford University Department of Philosophy faculty", "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison faculty", "Writers from Independence, Missouri", "Yale University faculty", "20th-century American male writers", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician, philosopher and logician\nKenneth Jon Barwise (/\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0rwa\u026az/; June 29, 1942\u00a0\u2013 March 5, 2000)[1] was an American mathematician, philosopher and logician who proposed some fundamental revisions to the way that logic is understood and used.\n\nContents\n\n1 Education and career\n2 Philosophical and logical work\n3 Selected publications\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEducation and career[edit]\nBorn in Independence, Missouri to Kenneth T. and Evelyn Barwise, Jon was a precocious child.\nA pupil of Solomon Feferman at Stanford University, Barwise started his research in infinitary logic.
