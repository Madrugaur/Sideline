It proved that two different systems for set theory that had previously been proposed as foundational were equiconsistent: either both are valid or both lead to contradictions. These two systems were Zermelo set theory and Von Neumann set theory. They differed from each other in that von Neumann had added to Zermelo's theory a notion of classes, collections of mathematical objects that are defined by some property but do not necessarily form a set. (Often, intuitively, proper classes are \"too big\" to form sets; for instance, the collection of all sets cannot itself be a set, by Russell's paradox, but it can be a class.) Gaal's work showed that introducing this extra notion of a class is a safe step, one that does not introduce any new inconsistencies into the system.[1]\n Gaal is also the author of two books:\n Gaal was born in Vienna on January 17, 1924,[6] the daughter of a gynecologist and the sister of Gertrude M.
