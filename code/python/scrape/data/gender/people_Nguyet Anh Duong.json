She also served as the U.S. Navy focus point for explosives and the transition of Navy explosives into weapon systems, providing consultation to government/military, industries and allied nations. From 1999-2002, she managed all NSWC Indian Head's technical programs in Explosives and Undersea Weapons, from concept through engineering development to production and demilitarization.\n She successfully assembled and led a team of scientists and engineers to develop a thermobaric bomb. They then proceeded to limited production and delivery to the Air Force, all in an unprecedented period of 67 days.[3]\n Nguyet Anh successfully led the development and transition of a total of 10 high-performing explosives into 18 different weapons in the past 12 years, which is an unprecedented record of its kind. She has served as a U.S. Delegate at the NATO AC310 Subgroup I for Explosives, and chairman/member of many national and international Panels/Technical Steering Groups.\n Since 2002, Nguyet Anh has been the director of Science and Technology of Naval Surface Warfare Center, U.S. Department of Defense, where she was responsible for Indian Head's overall technical investment strategies, guiding and overseeing research and development programs in all areas of science and technology and focusing these efforts toward the creation of future weapon generations for the United States.\n Since 2009, Duong has been the director for the Borders and Maritime Security Division within the United States Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate.[4][5]\n In 1999 she was awarded the Dr. Arthur E.
