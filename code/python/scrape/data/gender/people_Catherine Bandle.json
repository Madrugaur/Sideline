{"name": "Catherine Bandle", "content": "\nCatherine Bandle (born 22 March 1943)[1] is a Swiss mathematician known for her research on differential equations, including semilinear elliptic equations and reaction-diffusion equations, and for her book on isoperimetric inequalities. She is a professor emerita of mathematics at the University of Basel.[2]\n Bandle completed her doctorate (Dr. math.) at ETH Zurich in 1971. Her dissertation, Konstruktion isoperimetrischer Ungleichungen der mathematischen Physik aus solchen der Geometrie, concerned isoperimetric inequalities and was jointly supervised by Joseph Hersch and Alfred Huber.[3][1] Like Alice Roth before her, she received the ETH Silver Medal for her dissertation, and she continued at ETH Zurich for a habilitation in 1974. She was the first woman mathematician and one of the earliest women to earn a habilitation at ETH Zurich. She became a professor at the University of Basel in 1975 and remained there until her retirement in 2003.[4]\n Bandle is the author of the book Isoperimetric Inequalities and Applications (Pitman, 1980).
