Dolciani Professor of Mathematics at the CUNY Graduate Center and Hunter College.\n Kharlampovich is known for her example of a finitely presented 3-step solvable group with unsolvable word problem (solution of the Novikov\u2013Adian problem) [pub 1] and for the solution together with A. Myasnikov of the Tarski conjecture (from 1945) about equivalence of first order theories of finitely generated non-abelian free groups[pub 2] (also solved by Zlil Sela[3]) and  decidability of this common theory.\n Algebraic geometry for groups, that  was introduced by Baumslag, Myasnikov, Remeslennikov [4] and Kharlampovich [pub 3]\n[pub 4]\nbecame one of the new research directions in combinatorial group theory.\n She received her Ph.D.  from the Leningrad State University (her doctoral advisor was Lev Shevrin) and Russian \u201cDoctor of Science\u201d in 1990 from the Moscow Steklov Institute.\n Prior to her current appointment at CUNY, she held a position at the Ural State University, Ekaterinburg, Russia, and  was a Professor of Mathematics at McGill University,  Montreal, Canada, where she had been working since 1990.\nAs of August 2011 she moved to Hunter College of the City University of New York as the Mary P. Dolciani Professor of Mathematics, where she is the inaugural holder of the first endowed professorship in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.\n For her undergraduate work on the Novikov\u2013Adian problem she was awarded in 1981 a  Medal from the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
