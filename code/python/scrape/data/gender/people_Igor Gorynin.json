He graduated from the Department of Metallurgy of the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute in 1949 After graduation he worked for a few months for the transformer plant in Zaporizhia (Zaporozhye Transformer Plant) then started to work for the Central Research Institute of Structural Materials Prometey. Since 1977 he has been the director of the Institute.[1]\n In 1957 he became a Candidate of Science for his works on plastic deformation on the properties for the high-strength steels for ship hulls.[3]\n In 1967  he became a Doctor of Science for his work on the construction materials for nuclear reactors.
