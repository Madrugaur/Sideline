{"name": "Marta Lewicka", "content": "Marta Lewicka (born 23 November 1972) is a Polish-American professor of mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh, specializing in mathematical analysis. Lewicka has contributed results in the theory of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, fluid dynamics, calculus of variations, nonlinear elasticity, nonlinear potential theory and differential games.\n Lewicka earned bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics in 1996 from the University of Gda\u0144sk, and a second engineering bachelor's degree in computer science in 1998 from Cz\u0119stochowa University of Technology.[1] She completed her Ph.D. in 2000 from the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy under the supervision of Alberto Bressan.[1][2] After postdoctoral research at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig, Germany and a term as L.E. Dickson Instructor at the University of Chicago, she joined the University of Minnesota faculty in 2005. She moved in 2010 to Rutgers University, and again in 2011 to the University of Pittsburgh.[1]\n In 2016, she gave an AMS invited address at the AMS/MAA Joint Mathematical Meetings in the area of nonlinear elasticity and geometry of prestrained materials.[3] In 2017, she gave a Howard Rowlee Lecture.[4] In 2017, she received Professor\u2019s scientific title, awarded in Poland by the President of the Republic of Poland.[5] In 2018, she received a Simons Fellowship in Mathematics.[6] She was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in the Class of 2021.[7] Her citation read \u201cFor contributions to partial differential equations, calculus of variations, and continuum mechanics.\u201d\n ", "tags": ["1972 births", "Living people", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Polish mathematicians", "Polish women mathematicians", "University of Gda\u0144sk alumni", "University of Minnesota faculty", "Rutgers University faculty", "University of Pittsburgh faculty", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Polish-American mathematician\nMarta LewickaBorn (1972-11-23) 23 November 1972 (age\u00a048)Gda\u0144sk, PolandNationalityPolish, AmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Gda\u0144sk SISSAScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of PittsburghDoctoral advisorAlberto Bressan\nWebsitewww.math.pitt.edu/~lewicka/\nMarta Lewicka (born 23 November 1972) is a Polish-American professor of mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh, specializing in mathematical analysis.
