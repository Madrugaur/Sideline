In 1951, Krupa created skis for walking on water which he used to walk on Croatia's Korana River. \nIn 1954 Krupa created the first modern suitcase on wheels, and in 1957 he created a glass-bottom boat that could be used to observe underwater. Krupa also invented a folding canvas catamaran and boxing gloves that could be inflated with compressed air. Krupa attempted to patent these inventions by contacting authorities in Belgrade, Yugoslavia and even the British Embassy, but he eventually gave up on the idea. Born in Mikolow, Poland in 1915, he lost both his parents at an early age and was raised along with his two brothers and a sister by his grandmother.
