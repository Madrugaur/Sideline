{"name": "Leon Chwistek", "content": "Leon Chwistek (Krak\u00f3w, Austria-Hungary, 13 June 1884 \u2013 20 August 1944, Barvikha near Moscow, Russia) was a Polish avant-garde painter, theoretician of modern art, literary critic, logician, philosopher and mathematician.\n In 1919 he was one of the founders of the Polish Mathematical Society. From 1922, he lectured in mathematics for natural scientists at the Jagiellonian University, where he obtained his habilitation in 1928 in mathematical logic.\n Starting in 1929, Chwistek was a Professor of Logic at the University of Lw\u00f3w in a position for which Alfred Tarski had also applied. His interests in the 1930s were in a general system of philosophy of science, which was published in a book translated in English 1948 as The Limits of Science.[1]\n In the 1920s-30s, many European philosophers attempted to reform traditional philosophy by means of mathematical logic. Leon Chwistek did not believe that such reform could succeed. He thought that reality could not be described in one homogeneous system, based on the principles of formal logic, because there was not one reality but many. \n After the outbreak of World War II and the occupation of Lviv by the USSR, he remained at the university. He also started cooperation with Czerwony Sztandar.[2] In September 1940, he joined the Union of Soviet Writers of Ukraine. In June 1941, just before the entry of the German troops, he evacuated from Lviv together with the Soviet troops deep into Russia. From 1941 to 1943, he lived in Tbilisi, where he taught mathematical analysis, and from 1943 in Moscow. He was active in the Union of Polish Patriots in the USSR\n Chwistek argued against the axiomatic method by demonstrating that the extant axiomatic systems are inconsistent.[3]\n Chwistek developed his theory of the multiplicity of realities first with regard to the arts. He distinguished four basic types of realities, then matched them with four basic types of painting.\n The four types of realities were:\n The types of painting corresponding to the above were:\n Chwistek never intended his views to constitute a new metaphysical theory. He was a defender of \"common sense\" against metaphysics and irrational feeling. His theory of plural reality was merely an attempt to specify the various ways in which the term, \u201creal,\u201d is used.\n Chwistek's fellow-artist and closest friend, Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz, harshly criticized his  philosophical views.  Witkiewicz's own philosophy was based on a monadic character to the individual's existence, embracing a multiplicity of existences, with the world being made up of a multiplicity of Particular Existences.\n Fencing, 1919\n Portrait of Tytus Czy\u017cewski, c.1920\n Female Nude \u2013 Butterflies, c.1920\n Bathers, c.1920\n Lying Female Act, c.1922\n Leda, c.1925\n Feast, 1925\n Venus, 1928\n Carousel, 1936\n Nude, 1939\n ", "tags": ["1884 births", "1944 deaths", "Artists from Krak\u00f3w", "Polish logicians", "Polish mathematicians", "Polish philosophers", "20th-century Polish painters", "20th-century male artists", "Polish male painters", "20th-century philosophers", "Articles needing additional references from September 2009", "All articles needing additional references", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " Leon Chwistek\n Portrait of Leon Chwistek by Witkacy, 1913\nLeon Chwistek (Krak\u00f3w, Austria-Hungary, 13 June 1884 \u2013 20 August 1944, Barvikha near Moscow, Russia) was a Polish avant-garde painter, theoretician of modern art, literary critic, logician, philosopher and mathematician.\n\nContents\n\n1 Career and philosophy\n2 Artist\n3 Works\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nCareer and philosophy[edit]\nIn 1919 he was one of the founders of the Polish Mathematical Society.

He distinguished four basic types of realities, then matched them with four basic types of painting.\nThe four types of realities were:\n\n1. popular reality (common-sense realism)\n2. physical reality (constructed by physics)\n3. phenomenal reality (sensory impressions)\n4. visionary/intuitive reality (dreams, hallucinations, subconscious states).\nThe types of painting corresponding to the above were:\n\n1. Primitivism\n2. Realism\n3. Impressionism\n4. Futurism\nChwistek never intended his views to constitute a new metaphysical theory. He was a defender of \"common sense\" against metaphysics and irrational feeling.
