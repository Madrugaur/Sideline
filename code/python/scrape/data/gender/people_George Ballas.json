He was the son of Karolos (\"Charles\") Ballas and Maria (n\u00e9e Lymnaos), who were Greek immigrants that ran a restaurant.[3] His brother is Peter Ballas.\n He enlisted in the United States Army at the age of 17 in 1942 during World War II and was a bombardier.[1] Ballas would later serve in the Korean War.\n He married Maria Marulanda who was of Mexican and Spanish descent in 1951.\n He had five children, Corky Ballas, George Ballas Jr., Michelle Ballas Pritchard, Maria Ballas Jamail, and Lillian Ballas Miles.\n His grandson Mark Ballas is a dancer in Dancing with the Stars. He had six other grandchildren.\n Ballas got the idea for the trimmer while driving through an automatic car wash, where the rotating brushes gave him an idea. Using a tin can laced with fishing line and an edge trimmer, he tried out his idea, which worked. After some refinements, he shopped it around to several tool makers, who all rejected his invention. He went on to develop the garden tool himself. The first year, sales were over a half million dollars. By 1977 they were $80 million, and Ballas sold his company the following year to Emerson Electric Company.[4]\n ", "tags": ["1925 births", "2011 deaths", "20th-century American inventors", "American people of Greek descent", "Businesspeople from Houston", "Military personnel from Houston", "United States Army Air Forces personnel of World War II", "American military personnel of the Korean War", "20th-century American businesspeople", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Pages using infobox military person with embed", "Articles with hCards", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "American entrepreneur and inventor\nGeorge BallasBornGeorge Charles Ballas(1925-06-28)June 28, 1925Ruston, Louisiana, U.S.DiedJune 25, 2011(2011-06-25) (aged\u00a085)Houston, Texas, U.S.NationalityAmericanOccupationEntrepreneurKnown\u00a0forInventor of Weed EaterSpouse(s)Maria Marulanda (m. 1951)Children5, including Corky BallasMilitary careerAllegianceUnited StatesService/branchUnited States ArmyYears\u00a0of service1942\u20131953Commands heldBombardier and Second Lt. and OSI AgentBattles/warsWorld War IIKorean War\nGeorge Charles Ballas Sr. (June 28, 1925 \u2013 June 25, 2011) was an American entrepreneur.
