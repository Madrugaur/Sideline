He shows how to convert a problem stated verbally into a system of polynomial equations (up to 14th order), by using up to four unknowns: \u5929 Heaven, \u5730 Earth, \u4eba Man, \u7269 Matter, and then how to reduce the system to a single polynomial equation in one unknown by successive elimination of unknowns.
