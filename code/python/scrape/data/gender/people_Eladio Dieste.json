His uncle was the Spanish poet Rafael Dieste.\nA particular innovation was his Gaussian vault, a thin-shell structure for roofs in single-thickness brick, that derives its stiffness and strength from a double curvature catenary arch form that resists buckling failure.[1]\nThere were several architects and engineers in South and Latin America who were working in the modernist language, such as Guillermo Gonzalez Zuleta in Colombia, Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva in Venezuela and F\u00e9lix Candela in Mexico, who brought architecture and structural engineering into close proximity, especially when undertaking humble commissions. His buildings were mostly roofed with thin shell vaults constructed of brick and ceramic tiles. These forms were cheaper than reinforced concrete, and didn't require ribs and beams. In developing this approach, even in comparison with modernists the world over, he was an innovator.[2]\nDieste is quoted about his use of materials and structure:\n\nThere are deep moral/practical reasons for our search which give form to our work: with the form we create we can adjust to the laws of matter with all reverence, forming a dialogue with reality and its mysteries in essential communion... For architecture to be truly constructed, the materials must be used with profound respect for their essence and possibilities; only thus can 'cosmic economy' be achieved... in agreement with the profound order of the world; only then can have that authority that so astounds us in the great works of the past.[3]\nWith regard to structure Dieste stated:\n\nThe resistant virtues of the structure that we make depend on their form; it is through their form that they are stable and not because of an awkward accumulation of materials. There is nothing more noble and elegant from an intellectual viewpoint than this; resistance through form.[4]\nMany of the techniques that he developed to achieve these forms, such as pre-stressing of brickwork and moveable formworks, were in advance of contemporary techniques in the developed world.\nHe died, aged 82, in Montevideo.\n\nSelected works[edit]\nSt. Peter Church in Durazno\nChrist the Worker Church in Estaci\u00f3n Atl\u00e1ntida[5]\nChurch of Our Lady of Lourdes in Malv\u00edn\nSt. John of Avila Church in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares\nTeatro de Verano Ram\u00f3n Collazo in Montevideo\nMontevideo Shopping (structure of the first stage, 1985; architect: Guillermo G\u00f3mez Platero)\nChurch of St. Charles Borromeo (structural calculation, 1956; architect: Juan Pablo Terra)\nReferences[edit]\n\n^ The double-curvature masonry vaults of Eladio Dieste, Pedreschi, R, Theodossopoulos, D, ICE Proceedings, Structures and Buildings, Vol 160, Issue 1, pp 3-11, Thomas Telford - ICE Virtual Library\n\n^ Anderson, Stanford.
