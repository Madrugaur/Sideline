{"name": "Luis Barrag\u00e1n", "content": "Luis Ramiro Barrag\u00e1n Morf\u00edn (March 9, 1902 \u2013 November 22, 1988) was a Mexican architect and engineer. His work has influenced contemporary architects visually and conceptually.[1]  Barrag\u00e1n's buildings are frequently visited by international students and professors of architecture. He studied as an engineer in his home town, while undertaking the entirety of additional coursework to obtain the title of architect.[2]\n Barrag\u00e1n won the Pritzker Prize, the highest award in architecture, in 1980, and his personal home, the Luis Barrag\u00e1n House and Studio, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.\n Barrag\u00e1n was born in Guadalajara in Jalisco, Mexico. Educated as an engineer, he graduated from the Escuela Libre de Ingenieros in Guadalajara in 1923. After graduation, he traveled through Spain and France. While in France he became aware of the writings of Ferdinand Bac, a German-French writer, designer and artist who Barrag\u00e1n cited throughout his life.[3] In 1931, he again traveled to France with a long stop-over in New York. In this trip he met Mexican mural painter Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco, architectural magazine editors, and Frederick Kiesler. In France he briefly met Le Corbusier and finally visited the gardens realized by Ferdinand Bac. He practiced architecture in Guadalajara from 1927\u20131936, and in Mexico City thereafter.\n His Guadalajara work includes over a dozen private homes in the Colonia Americana area of what is today near downtown Guadalajara. These homes, within walking distance of each other, include Barrag\u00e1n's earliest residential projects. One of his first buildings, Casa Cristo, was restored and houses the state's Architects' Guild.\n In 1945 he started planning the residential development of Jardines del Pedregal, Mexico City. In 1947 he built his own house and studio in Tacubaya and in 1955 he rebuilt the Convento de las Capuchinas Sacramentarias in Tlalpan, Mexico City, and the plan for Jardines del Bosque in Guadalajara. In 1957 he planned Torres de Sat\u00e9lite (an urban sculpture created in collaboration with sculptor Mathias Goeritz) and an exclusive residential area, Las Arboledas, a few kilometers away from Ciudad Sat\u00e9lite. In 1964 he designed, alongside architect Juan Sordo Madaleno, the Lomas Verdes residential area, also near the Sat\u00e9lite area, in the municipality of Naucalpan, Estado de M\u00e9xico. In 1967 he created one of his best-known works, the San Crist\u00f3bal Estates equestrian development in Mexico City.\n Fuente de los Amantes\n Casa Gilardi\n Casa Gilardi\n Torres de Sat\u00e9lite (in collaboration with sculptor Mathias Goeritz)\n Barrag\u00e1n visited Le Corbusier and became influenced by European modernism. The buildings he produced in the years after his return to Mexico show the typical clean lines of the Modernist movement. Nonetheless, according to Andr\u00e9s Casillas (who worked with Barrag\u00e1n), he eventually became entirely convinced that the house should not be \"a machine for living.\" Opposed to functionalism, Barrag\u00e1n strove for an \"emotional architecture\" claiming that \"any work of architecture which does not express serenity is a mistake.\" Barrag\u00e1n used raw materials such as stone or wood. He combined them with an original and dramatic use of light, both natural and artificial; his preference for hidden light sources gives his interiors a particularly subtle and lyrical atmosphere.\n Barrag\u00e1n worked for years with little acknowledgement or praise until 1975 when he was honored with a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In 1980, he became the second winner of the Pritzker Architecture Prize. His house and studio, built in 1948 in Mexico City, were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004.\n The work of Luis Barrag\u00e1n is often (and misleadingly) quoted in reference to minimalist architecture. John Pawson, in his book Minimum, includes images from some of Barrag\u00e1n's projects. Most architects who do minimalistic architecture do not use color, but the ideas of forms and spaces which Barrag\u00e1n pioneered are still there.[citation needed] There have been several essays written by the Pritzker Prize recipient Alvaro Siza in prefaces to books that make reference to the ideas of Barrag\u00e1n.[citation needed]\n Louis Kahn informally consulted Barrag\u00e1n on the space between the buildings of the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California.[4] According to the documents, Kahn's original idea was to place a garden between the buildings; however, Barrag\u00e1n suggested that an open plaza, with only a water feature in between, would better reflect the spirit of the location. This area, possibly designed with Barrag\u00e1n's advice in mind, is arguably the most impressive aspect of the building complex. He was a highly recognized consultor by many Mexican and International architects on landscape design, as he had a particular ability to envision the outdoor spaces and their relation to their interior paradigms and the natural context characteristics.\n Barrag\u00e1n's influence can be seen in the work of many of Mexico's contemporary architects, especially in Ricardo Legorreta's projects. One of the projects, where Barrag\u00e1n's concepts and colors inspired Legorreta, is the Hotel Camino Real in Polanco, Mexico City. This project reflects the importance of the native culture and its intersection with an elegant modern design.\n Barrag\u00e1n died at the age of eighty-six in Mexico City. In his will, he designated three people to manage his legacy: Ignacio D\u00edaz Morales, \u00d3scar Gonz\u00e1lez Gonz\u00e1lez, and Ra\u00fal Ferrera.[5] Ignacio D\u00edaz Morales, a friend and fellow architect, was bequeathed Barrag\u00e1n's library. He was tasked with choosing an institution suitable for receiving the book collection.  \u00d3scar Ignacio Gonz\u00e1lez, a childhood friend, received Barrag\u00e1n's personal objects. Ra\u00fal Ferrera, his business partner, received the archives and the copyright to the work. D\u00edaz Morales established the Fundaci\u00f3n de Arquitectura Tapat\u00eda, a private foundation managed by the Casa Barrag\u00e1n, in co-ownership with the Government of the State of Jalisco. The house is now a museum which celebrates Barrag\u00e1n and serves as a conduit between scholars and architects interested in visiting other Barrag\u00e1n buildings in Mexico.[6] UNESCO added the Casa Luis Barrag\u00e1n to its World Heritage List in 2004.[7]\n Following Ra\u00fal Ferrera's passing away in 1993, the archives and related copyright became the property of Mrs Ferrera's widows who, after having unsuccessfully tried to find a collector or institution willing to keep these in Mexico, decided to sell them to the Max Protetch Gallery in New York. The documents were offered to a number of prospective clients, among them the Vitra Design Museum,[8] which in 1994 was planning an exhibition dedicated to Luis Barrag\u00e1n. Following the Vitra[9] company's policy of collecting objects and archives of design and architecture, the archives were finally acquired in their entirety and transferred to the Barrag\u00e1n Foundation in Switzerland.\n The Barragan Foundation[10] is a not-for-profit institution based in Birsfelden, Switzerland. Since 1996, it manages the archives of Luis Barrag\u00e1n, and in 1997 acquired the negatives of the photographer Armando Salas Portugal documenting Barrag\u00e1n's work. The Foundation's mission is to spread the knowledge on Luis Barrag\u00e1n's cultural legacy by means of preserving and studying his archives and related historical sources, producing publications and exhibitions, providing expertise and assistance to further institutions and scholarly researches. The Barrag\u00e1n Foundation owns complete rights to the work of Luis Barrag\u00e1n and to the related photos by Armando Salas Portugal.\n All finished projects by Barrag\u00e1n are located in Mexico.\n Luis Barrag\u00e1n set up his studio in Mexico City, the building is currently a museum, but with tours available only by appointment. The building is from 1948 reflecting Barrag\u00e1n's preferred style, where he lived his whole life. Today is owned by Jalisco and the Arquitectura Tapat\u00eda Luis Barrag\u00e1n Foundation. The site became World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2004.[11]\n In Tite Kubo's manga series Bleach, the character Baraggan Louisenbarn is named after Luis Barrag\u00e1n.\n ", "tags": ["Modernist architects from Mexico", "Architecture firms of Mexico", "Pritzker Architecture Prize winners", "1902 births", "1988 deaths", "Architects from Mexico City", "Artists from Guadalajara, Jalisco", "Modernist architecture in Mexico", "20th-century Mexican architects", "CS1 maint: bot: original URL status unknown", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from September 2018", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Mexican architect (1902-1988)\nFor the Argentine painter, see Luis Barrag\u00e1n (painter).
