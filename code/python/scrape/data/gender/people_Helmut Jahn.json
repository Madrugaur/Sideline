{"name": "Helmut Jahn", "content": "Helmut Jahn (born January 4, 1940) is a Chicago-based German-American architect,  known for designs such as the Sony Center on the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, Germany; the Messeturm in Frankfurt, Germany; the One Liberty Place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (formerly the tallest building in Philadelphia); and the Suvarnabhumi Airport, an international airport in Bangkok, Thailand.
