O. Paton Electric Welding Institute in Kyiv. Paton was a people's deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (1946\u20131953). He was the father of Borys Paton.\n Born in 1870 in Nice, France, he studied at the Dresden Technical University (graduated in 1894), and at the Petersburg Institute of Railway Roads (graduated in 1896). He designed the structure of the train station in Dresden, and was a lecturer at the  Moscow Engineering College of Railway Roads (1889\u20131904). Paton was a Professor at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute and the Chairman of the Bridge Department from 1904 to 1938. In 1929 he organized a welding laboratory and the Electric Welding Committee. In 1934 Paton founded the Electric Welding Institute of the Academy of Sciences of Ukrainian SSR in Kyiv. From 1945 to 1952 he was a Vice-President of the Academy of Sciences of Ukrainian SSR.\n Paton was a pioneer researcher of joining and welding technology. In order to make welding a reliable technological process, it was necessary to conduct comprehensive research regarding the mechanics of welded structures, the metallurgical processes involved, and the physics of the arc, as well as to develop welding equipment, tools, and techniques.\n Paton created methods used in the design of rational bridge spans, investigated the conditions of their operation, and suggested methods for restoring damaged bridges. He carried out research on the fundamentals of welding, how to calculate the strength of welded structures, and the mechanization of welding processes. He supervised the development of automatic submerged arc welding. During World War II Paton supervised the design and production of  equipment and technology for automated welding of special steels for tanks, bombs, and other military hardware.\n Paton supervised the wide implementation of welding in industry, including the design and production of assembly-line welding systems. He designed welded bridges and founded a domestic school of metal welding. Paton was awarded almost all of the highest Soviet government and scientific awards and prizes, and received the title of the Hero of Socialist Labour.\n ", "tags": ["1870 births", "1953 deaths", "Burials at Baikove Cemetery", "People from Nice", "French people of Russian descent", "History of Kyiv", "Bridge engineers", "Russian civil engineers", "Ukrainian bridge engineers", "Ukrainian civil engineers", "Heroes of Socialist Labour", "Soviet engineers", "20th-century Russian engineers", "Russian inventors", "Ukrainian engineers", "Ukrainian inventors", "TU Dresden alumni", "Russians in Ukraine", "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute", "Articles lacking sources from November 2011", "All articles lacking sources", "Biography with signature", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article does not cite any sources.
