He was brother of the lighthouse engineers Alan and Thomas Stevenson. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh then studied at the University of Edinburgh.

In addition he helped Richard Henry Brunton design lighthouses for Japan, inventing a novel method for allowing them to withstand earthquakes. His sons David Alan Stevenson and Charles Alexander Stevenson continued his work after his death, building nearly thirty further lighthouses. \n In the 1860s he lived at 25 Royal Terrace, Edinburgh.[3]\n Non-lighthouse engineering included the Edinburgh and Leith Sewerage Scheme and the widening of North Bridge in Edinburgh.[4]\n In 1868/9 he served as President of the Royal Scottish Society of the Arts.[2]\n He died in North Berwick on 17 July 1886. He is buried in Dean Cemetery in west Edinburgh.[5] The grave lies on the north wall of the original cemetery backing onto the first northern extension.\n In 1840 he married Elizabeth Mackay (1816-1871).
