{"name": "J. Max Bond Jr.", "content": "\nJ. Max Bond Jr. (1935[1] \u2013 February 18, 2009) was an American architect. He developed an interest in architecture based on experiences ranging from viewing a staircase at a dormitory at the Tuskegee Institute to views of North African construction styles on a visit to Tunisia. He became one of a small number of nationally prominent African-American architects.[2] He married writer Jean Carey Bond in 1961 and they had two children.[3]\n Bond was educated at Harvard University,[4] where he was awarded a bachelor's degree in 1955 and earned a master's degree three years later. During his time at Harvard, he was one of a group of eleven black students targeted by a cross-burning incident in front of their dormitory, Stoughton Hall.[5] He ignored advice from a Harvard faculty member to give up the professional pursuit of architecture due to his race, overcoming barriers in what was at the time a white profession.[2]\n He started his professional career in France with Andr\u00e9 Wogenscky. He moved back to New York City, working at the firms of Gruzen & Partners and at Pedersen & Tilney. He moved to Ghana  where he designed several government buildings, including the Bolgatanga Regional Library in an area near the border with Burkina Faso, which consisted of four buildings shaded by a common roof that was designed to provide natural ventilation and make air conditioning unnecessary.[2] He was in Ghana from 1964 until 1967.<ref.name=newa/>\n Back in the United States, he served as head of the Architects' Renewal Committee in Harlem (ARCH) in 1967 and 1968. In 1970, together with Donald P. Ryder, he founded the architectural firm of Bond Ryder & Associates which was responsible for the design of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta, and the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute in Birmingham, Alabama, as well as Harlem's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.[2]\n The firm merged with Davis, Brody & Associates after Ryder's retirement in 1990. Bond became a partner at the newly combined firm of Davis Brody Bond, bringing over nine architects to join the nearly 100 at Davis, Brody, which had been best known for its work at Manhattan residential developments at Riverbend Houses, Waterside Plaza and Zeckendorf Towers.[6] Bond was responsible for the museum component at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center site at the time of his death.[2]\n Bond served as chairman of the architecture division at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture and Planning from 1980 to 1984. He was dean from 1985 to 1992 at the City College of New York School of Architecture and Environmental Studies. He served as a member of the New York City Planning Commission from 1980 to 1986.[2]\n A resident of New York's Manhattan, Bond died of cancer at age 73 on February 18, 2009. He was survived by his wife, writer Jean Carey Bond, two children, three grandchildren, a sister and a brother.[2]\n His father was J. Max Bond Sr., President of the University of Liberia. His mother was Ruth Clement Bond, and his brother was Prof. George C. Bond (Columbia University/Teachers College).  His uncle was Horace Mann Bond, and his cousin was Julian Bond.\n ", "tags": ["1935 births", "2009 deaths", "20th-century American architects", "African-American architects", "Deaths from cancer in New York (state)", "City College of New York faculty", "Columbia University faculty", "Harvard Graduate School of Design alumni", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from July 2019", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-LCCN identifiers"], "raw": "American architect\n\nJ.
