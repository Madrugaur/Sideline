{"name": "Mark D. Maughmer", "content": "Mark D. Maughmer (born January 18, 1950) is a Professor of Aerospace Engineering in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University.  He is a widely published author known throughout the world as one of the leading aerodynamicists, especially in the areas of airfoil and winglet design and analysis, wing optimization, natural laminar flow aerodynamics, and subsonic, low turbulence wind-tunnel design and operation.[1]\n In 1987, Peter Masak called on Maughmer about designing winglets for his sailplane to improve performance. Others had attempted to apply Richard T. Whitcomb's NASA winglets to gliders, and though they did improve climb performance, this did not offset the parasite drag penalty in high speed cruise. Masak was convinced it was possible to overcome this hurdle, and Maughmer was willing to join his quest.\n By trial and error, they ultimately developed successful winglet designs for gliding competitions, and at the 1991 World Gliding Championships in Uvalde, Texas, the trophy for the highest speed went to a winglet equipped 15-meter class limited wingspan glider, exceeding the highest speed in the unlimited span Open Class, an exceptional result.[2]\n The winglets were originally retrofit to production sailplanes, but now most high-performance gliders are equipped from the factory with winglets, or some other wingtip device.[3] Maughmer has consulted with German sailplane designers on winglets, non-planar wing tips, and other aerodynamic improvements incorporated in several production sailplanes.[citation needed]\n He received his Ph.D. (Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering) from the University of Illinois in 1983, M.S. from Princeton University in 1975 and B.S. from the University of Illinois in 1972.
