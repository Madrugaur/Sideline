{"name": "V. Kumar Murty", "content": "Vijaya Kumar Murty FRSC (born 20 May 1956) is an Indo-Canadian mathematician working primarily in Number theory. He is currently the Director of Fields Institute[1](from 2019). Previously he was the department chair in the Mathematics Department at University of Toronto St. George.\n Murty obtained his BSc in 1977 from Carleton University and his PhD in mathematics in 1982 from Harvard University under John Tate.\n From 1982 to 1987 he held research positions at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, Concordia University, and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. In 1987, he was appointed as Associate Professor at the Downtown campus of the University of Toronto, and 1991 he was promoted to Full Professor. In 2001, he was deputed to the Mississauga campus to serve a two-year term as Associate Chair of Mathematics, and from 2004 to 2007 he served as the inaugural Chair of the newly-created Department of Mathematical and Computational Sciences at the Mississauga campus. Twice he was Chair of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Toronto Downtown campus (2008-2013 and 2014-2017). He is currently the Director of Fields Institute[1] (2019 - current).\n He and his brother, M.

He has served on the Canadian Mathematical Society Board of Directors, held vice-presidency at the Canadian Mathematical Society, and was elected Fields Institute Fellow in 2003. Murty received the Coxeter\u2013James Prize in 1991 from the Canadian Mathematical Society.[4] He was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in 1995.[5] In 1996, he, along with his brother, M.
