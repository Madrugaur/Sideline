{"name": "Penelope Maddy", "content": "Penelope Maddy (born 4 July 1950) is an American philosopher. She is a UCI Distinguished Professor of Logic and Philosophy of Science and of Mathematics at the University of California, Irvine.  She is well known for her influential work in the philosophy of mathematics, where she has worked on mathematical realism (especially set-theoretic realism) and mathematical naturalism.\n Maddy received her Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1979. Her dissertation, Set Theoretical Realism, was supervised by John P. Burgess.[2]\n Maddy's early work, culminating in Realism in Mathematics, defended Kurt G\u00f6del's position that mathematics is a true description of a mind-independent realm that we can access through our intuition.  However, she suggested that some mathematical entities are in fact concrete, unlike, notably, G\u00f6del, who assumed all mathematical objects are abstract.  She suggested that sets can be causally efficacious, and in fact share all the causal and spatiotemporal properties of their elements.  Thus, when one sees three cups on a table, one also sees the set.  She used contemporary work in cognitive science and psychology to support this position, pointing out that just as at a certain age we begin to see objects rather than mere sense perceptions, there is also a certain age at which we begin to see sets rather than just objects.\n In the 1990s, she moved away from this position, towards a position described in Naturalism in Mathematics.  Her \"naturalist\" position, like Quine's, suggests that since science is our most successful project so far for knowing about the world, philosophers should adopt the methods of science in their own discipline, and especially when discussing science.  As Maddy stated in an interview, \"If you're a 'naturalist', you think that science shouldn't be held to extra-scientific standards, that it doesn't require extra-scientific ratification.\"[3]  However, rather than a unified picture of the sciences like Quine's, she has a picture on which mathematics is separate.  This way, mathematics is neither supported nor undermined by the needs and goals of science, but is allowed to obey its own criteria.  This means that traditional metaphysical and epistemological concerns of the philosophy of mathematics are misplaced.  Like Wittgenstein, she suggests that many of these puzzles arise merely because of the application of language outside its proper domain of significance.\n She has been dedicated to understanding and explaining the methods that set theorists use in agreeing on axioms, especially those that go beyond ZFC.\n Maddy has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1998.[4]\nThe German Mathematical Society awarded her a Gauss Lectureship in 2006.\n ", "tags": ["1950 births", "Living people", "20th-century American philosophers", "21st-century American philosophers", "Philosophers of science", "Philosophers of mathematics", "American logicians", "Princeton University alumni", "University of California, Irvine faculty", "American women philosophers", "Women mathematicians", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Lakatos Award winners", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician and philosopher\nPenelope MaddyBorn4 July 1950Tulsa, OklahomaEducationPrinceton University (PhD, 1979)EraContemporary philosophyRegionWestern philosophySchoolAnalytic philosophyInstitutionsUniversity of California, IrvineThesisSet Theoretical Realism\u00a0(1979)Doctoral advisorJohn P.
