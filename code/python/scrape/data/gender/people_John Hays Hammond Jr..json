{"name": "John Hays Hammond Jr.", "content": "John Hays Hammond Jr. (April 13, 1888 \u2013 February 12, 1965) was an American inventor known as \"The Father of Radio Control\". Hammond\u2019s pioneering developments in electronic remote control  are the foundation for all modern radio remote control devices, including modern missile guidance systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAVs). Of Hammond\u2019s many individual inventions, the inventions which have seen the most significant application are the variable pitch or controlled pitch propellers and single dial radio tuning.[1][2][3] He was the son of mining engineer John Hays Hammond, Sr..\n Born in San Francisco, California, his family moved to South Africa and the Transvaal in 1893. His father was active as a mining engineer for Cecil Rhodes' mines in South Africa.  In 1898, the family moved to England, where young Hammond fell in love with castles and life in earlier times.  The family returned to the United States at the turn of the 20th century.\n At the age of twelve, Hammond accompanied his father on a business trip to Thomas Edison\u2019s laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey. Upon being introduced to Edison, the boy asked so many questions that the inventor gave him a personal tour of the complex and assumed the role of mentor.[citation needed] The two would remain in contact for the rest of Edison\u2019s life. While studying at the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University, Hammond became interested in the new study of radio waves and he was taken under the wing of Alexander Graham Bell. Bell also became his mentor and the two would remain close friends until Bell\u2019s death.\n After graduation from Yale in 1910, Hammond took a job in the U.S. Patent Office. His strategy was simple: having learned from Edison that \"inventing had to be a money-making proposition, where better to learn what fields were up-and-coming than in the Patent Office?\" After he became an authority on the patent process, he founded the Hammond Radio Research Laboratory on his father\u2019s estate in Gloucester, Massachusetts. In total, he is credited with more than 800 foreign and domestic patents on more than 400 inventions (the exact number of inventions is vague due to how credit was listed on the forms) mostly in the fields of radio control and naval weaponry.\n He served on the Board of Directors of RCA and a listing of his professional colleagues and society friends reads like a Who\u2019s Who  of the rich and famous. Aside from his inherited wealth, his inventions brought Hammond an additional fortune. Between the years 1926 and 1929, he built a castle (including a drawbridge) which became his home, laboratory, and a showplace for his collection of Roman, medieval, and Renaissance artifacts. Hammond was also interested in the mechanism and workings of the pipe organ, and had a huge organ installed in the castle's Great Hall.  Famous organists, including Richard Ellsasser and Virgil Fox, performed and made commercial recordings on this instrument, unfortunately no longer in operating condition (2015).  Overlooking Gloucester Harbor in the North Shore region of Massachusetts, Hammond Castle is now a museum which offers self-guided tours throughout half the year and hosts fundraising events on a regular basis.[4][5]\n Hammond was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal from The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1959.\n His castle was investigated by TAPS in 2012 for paranormal activity and this was shown on the TV show Ghost Hunters.[6]\n Hammond Castle was also featured on the PBS Reality Show FETCH! with Ruff Ruffman in Season One.\n Examples of Hammond's 400+ U.S. patents:\n 10/21/1919 \u2013 System of Teledynamic Control (1,275,741) \n5/20/1922 \u2013 System for Radio Control of Moving Bodies (1,420,258) \n11/6/1928 \u2013 Submarine sound transmission (1,500,243) \n3/18/1929 \u2013 Multi-channel radio system (1,717,662) \n12/29/1931 \u2013 Secret Radio Communication (1,838,762) \n5/19/1931 \u2013 Paravane Torpedo (1,806,346) \n12/14/1936 \u2013 Gaseous Detector of Radiant Energy (1,610,371) \n5/27/1941 \u2013 Variable Pitch Propeller Control (2,243,095) \n7/11/1944 \u2013 Radio Alarm System (2,343,499)\n ", "tags": ["1888 births", "1965 deaths", "People from San Francisco", "IEEE Medal of Honor recipients", "Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science alumni", "People from Gloucester, Massachusetts", "20th-century American inventors", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2015", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For other people named John Hammond, see John Hammond (disambiguation).\nJohn Hays Hammond Jr.May 22, 1922BornApril 13, 1888San Francisco, California, USADiedFebruary 12, 1965(1965-02-12) (aged\u00a076)New York, New York, USAAlma\u00a0materYale University (B.S., 1910)OccupationinventorSpouse(s)Irene E.
