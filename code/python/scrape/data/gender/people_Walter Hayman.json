{"name": "Walter Hayman", "content": "\n Walter Kurt Hayman FRS (6 January 1926 \u2013 1 January 2020) was a British mathematician known for contributions to complex analysis.[1] He was a professor at Imperial College London.[2]\n Hayman was born in Cologne, Germany, the son of Roman law professor Franz Haymann (1874-1947) and Ruth Therese Hensel, daughter of mathematician Kurt Hensel.[3] He was a great-grandson of acclaimed composer Fanny Mendelssohn. Because of his Jewish heritage, he left the Nazi regime in Germany, alone by train in 1938. He continued his schooling at Gordonstoun School,[4] and later at St John's College, Cambridge under John Edensor Littlewood and his doctoral advisor Mary Cartwright. He taught at King's College, Newcastle, and the University of Exeter.[5]\n In 1947, he married Margaret Riley Crann: together, they founded the British Mathematical Olympiad.[6]\n He is known for his asymptotic results in Bieberbach conjecture in 1955,[7] and for Hayman's alternatives in Nevanlinna Theory. His work with Wolfgang Fuchs gave a solution to an inverse problem of the Nevanlinna theory for entire functions, predating David Drasin's 1976 work.\n Hayman was elected to the Royal Society in 1956 and of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters in 1978:[8] he was elected \"Foreign member\" of the Accademia dei Lincei on 16 December 1985.[9] In 1992 he received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Mathematics and Science at Uppsala University, Sweden[10] In 1995 he was awarded the De Morgan Medal by the London Mathematical Society.[11] In 2008, an issue of the Journal Computational Methods and Function Theory was dedicated to him on the occasion of his 80th birthday.[12]\n ", "tags": ["1926 births", "2020 deaths", "20th-century British mathematicians", "21st-century British mathematicians", "People educated at Gordonstoun", "Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "German expatriates in the United Kingdom", "British people of German-Jewish descent", "Complex analysts", "Mathematical analysts", "Mathematics education in the United Kingdom", "Deans of the Royal College of Science", "De Morgan Medallists", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "EngvarB from August 2017", "Use dmy dates from August 2017", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 Italian-language sources (it)", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "British mathematician\n\n\nWalter HaymanBornWalter Kurt Hayman(1926-01-06)6 January 1926Cologne, GermanyDied1 January 2020(2020-01-01) (aged\u00a093)NationalityBritishEducationUniversity of CambridgeKnown\u00a0forTheory of subharmonic functionsUnivalent function theorySpouse(s)Margaret Hayman (n\u00e9e Crann)AwardsBerwick Prize (1955)Senior Berwick Prize (1964)De Morgan Medal (1995)Scientific careerFieldsComplex analysisInstitutionsKing's College, NewcastleUniversity of ExeterImperial College\nWebsitewww3.imperial.ac.uk/people/w.hayman\nWalter Kurt Hayman FRS (6 January 1926 \u2013 1 January 2020) was a British mathematician known for contributions to complex analysis.[1] He was a professor at Imperial College London.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and work\n2 Honours and awards\n3 Selected publications\n\n3.1 Papers\n3.2 Books\n\n\n4 Notes\n5 References\n\n5.1 Biographical references\n5.2 General references\n\n\n6 External links\n\n\nLife and work[edit]\nHayman was born in Cologne, Germany, the son of Roman law professor Franz Haymann (1874-1947) and Ruth Therese Hensel, daughter of mathematician Kurt Hensel.[3] He was a great-grandson of acclaimed composer Fanny Mendelssohn.
