She is known for her research in discrete geometry, geometric probability, and the theory of random graphs.[1]\nWith Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi and others, she was considered to be one of the members of the Hungarian School of Probability.[2]\n In connection to the Erd\u0151s distinct distances problem, Pal\u00e1sti studied the existence of point sets for which the \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\nth least frequent distance occurs \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n times. That is, in such points there is one distance that occurs only once, another distance that occurs exactly two times, a third distance that occurs exactly three times, etc. For instance, three points with this structure must form an isosceles triangle. Any \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n evenly-spaced points on a line or circular arc also have the same property, but Paul Erd\u0151s asked whether this is possible for points in general position (no three on a line, and no four on a circle). Pal\u00e1sti found an eight-point set with this property, and showed that for any number of points between three and eight (inclusive) there is a subset of the hexagonal lattice with this property. Pal\u00e1sti's eight-point example remains the largest known.[3][4][E]\n Another of Pal\u00e1sti's results in discrete geometry concerns the number of triangular faces in an arrangement of lines. When no three lines may cross at a single point, she and Zolt\u00e1n F\u00fcredi found sets of \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n lines, subsets of the diagonals of a regular \n\n\n\n2\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2n}\n\n-gon, having \n\n\n\nn\n(\nn\n\u2212\n3\n)\n\n/\n\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n(n-3)/3}\n\n triangles. This remains the best lower bound known for this problem, and differs from the upper bound by only \n\n\n\nO\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n)}\n\n triangles.[3][D]\n In geometric probability, Pal\u00e1sti is known for her conjecture on random sequential adsorption, also known in the one-dimensional case as \"the parking problem\". In this problem, one places non-overlapping balls within a given region, one at a time with random locations, until no more can be placed. Pal\u00e1sti conjectured that the average packing density in \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n-dimensional space could be computed as the \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\nth power of the one-dimensional density.[5] Although her conjecture led to subsequent research in the same area, it has been shown to be inconsistent with the actual average packing density in dimensions two through four.[6][A]\n Pal\u00e1sti's results in the theory of random graphs include bounds on the probability that a random graph has a Hamiltonian circuit, and on the probability that a random directed graph is strongly connected.[7][B][C]\n ", "tags": ["1924 births", "1991 deaths", "Hungarian mathematicians", "Women mathematicians", "Graph theorists", "Probability theorists", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian mathematician\nIlona Pal\u00e1sti (1924\u20131991) was a Hungarian mathematician who worked at the Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics.
