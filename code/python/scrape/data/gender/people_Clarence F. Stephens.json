{"name": "Clarence F. Stephens", "content": "Clarence Francis Stephens (July 24, 1917 \u2013 March 5, 2018) was the ninth African American to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics. He is credited with inspiring students and faculty at SUNY Potsdam to form the most successful United States undergraduate mathematics degree programs in the past century. Stephens was recognized by Mathematically Gifted & Black as a Black History Month 2018 Honoree.[1]\n One of six children, he was orphaned at the age of eight he was the 5 child to be born.[2]  For his early education, he attended Harbison Agricultural and Industrial Institute, a boarding school for African-Americans in Irmo, South Carolina under Dean R. W. Bouleware and later President Rev John G. Porter.\n Stephens graduated from Johnson C. Smith University in 1938 with a B.S. degree in mathematics. He received his M.S. (1939) and his Ph.D. (1944) from the University of Michigan. He was the 9th African American to receive a Ph.D in mathematics\u2013\u2013for a thesis on Non-Linear Difference Equations Analytic in a Parameter under James Nyswander.[2]\n After serving in the U.S. Navy (1942\u20131946) as a Teaching Specialist, Dr. Stephens joined the mathematics faculty of Prairie View A&M University. The next year (1947) he was invited to join the mathematics faculty at Morgan State University.\n As a Mathematics Association of America (MAA) biography explains, \u201cDr. Stephens' focus was on being a research mathematician, so he accepted the position in part because he would be near a research library at Johns Hopkins University. While at Morgan State University, Dr. Stephens became appalled at what a poor job was being done in general to teach and inspire students to learn mathematics. He changed his focus from being a researcher to achieving excellence, with desirable results, in teaching mathematics.\n In 1953, he received a one-year Ford Fellowship to study at Princeton University's Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.[3]\n Dr. Stephens remained at Morgan State until 1962, where is credited with initiating the program which led to five students achieving 91% to 99% on the graduate record exam in mathematics, three of these students (Earl R. Barnes, Arthur D. Grainger and Scott W. Williams) became the only three students of the same class at a Historically Black College to earn a PhD in mathematics.<Mathematicians of the African Diaspora/ref> Stephens accepted an appointment as professor of mathematics at SUNY Geneseo. In 1969 he left Geneseo to join the mathematics faculty at SUNY Potsdam, where he served as chair of the mathematics department until his retirement in 1987.\n The MAA biography reports that during Dr. Stephens\u2019 tenure at SUNY Potsdam \"the department became nationally known as a model of teaching excellence in mathematics. For several of these years the program was among the top producers of mathematics majors in the country. The teaching techniques that Professor Stephens introduced at Potsdam, and earlier at Morgan State, have been adopted by many mathematics departments across the country. They have been described in publications by the MAA, and recently in a book, Math Education At Its Best: The Potsdam Model, by Datta (Center for Teaching/Learning of Mathematics, 1993).\" He turned 100 in July 2017[4] and died in March 2018.[5]\n \n ", "tags": ["1917 births", "2018 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "African-American people", "African-American centenarians", "American centenarians", "Johnson C.
