{"name": "Philipp Apian", "content": "Philipp Apian (14 September 1531 \u2013 14 November 1589) was a German mathematician and medic. The son of Petrus Apianus (1495\u20131552), he is also known as the cartographer of Bavaria.\n He was born in Ingolstadt as Philipp Bienewitz (or Bennewitz). At age eleven, the son of mathematician, astronomer and cartographer Peter Apian started to study mathematics at the University of Ingolstadt. Later, aged 18, he studied in Burgundy, Paris and Bourges.\n Returning in 1552 he became a professor. As a Protestant he had to leave in 1569 due to Jesuits and the counter reformation. At the University of T\u00fcbingen he lectured for 14 years until he lost this position in 1583 for refusing to negate Calvinism.  He died in T\u00fcbingen.\n In 1554, Duke Albrecht of Bavaria ordered Apian to create a map of Bavaria for the Bairische Chronik of Johannes Aventinus written 1526 to 1533. Over the course of seven years, Apian travelled through Oberbayern and Niederbayern, Oberpfalz, Archbishopric Salzburg and Bishopric Eichst\u00e4tt. After two years work, a 5 x 5 meter sized map in scale 1:45.000 was finished, to be coloured by Bartel Refinger.\n The map, which had been in the residence's library since 1563, was destroyed by a fire in 1782.\n Smaller Bairische Landtafeln based on the map were ordered by Philipp Apian in 1566 from Jost Amman as 24 tables of scale 1:144.000. This second version was issued in 1568. It was considered the official map of Bavaria until the 19th century.[1]\n It is said that the accuracy was not surpassed until 19th century, and that Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte used them when invading Bavaria.\n Abraham Ortelius published them as ex tabula Philippi Apiani.\n ", "tags": ["1531 births", "1589 deaths", "16th-century German mathematicians", "German cartographers", "16th-century cartographers", "16th-century German writers", "16th-century male writers", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DSI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " Philipp Apian (painting by Hans Ulrich Alt, 1590)\n Philipp Apian (woodcut by Jochachim Lederlin, 1596)\nPhilipp Apian (14 September 1531 \u2013 14 November 1589) was a German mathematician and medic.
