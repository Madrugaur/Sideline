{"name": "Pellegrino Tibaldi", "content": "Pellegrino Tibaldi (Valsolda, 1527\u2013Milan, 1596), also known as Pellegrino di Tibaldo de Pellegrini, was an Italian mannerist architect, sculptor, and mural painter.\n Tibaldi was born in Puria di Valsolda, then part of the duchy of Milan, but grew up in Bologna. His father worked as stonemason. He may have apprenticed with Bagnacavallo or Innocenzo da Imola. His first documented painting was likely as at 15 years of age, a Marriage of Saint Catherine.\n In 1547, he went to Rome to study under Perin del Vaga.  He was employed in the decoration of the Sala del Consiglio of Castel Sant'Angelo.  When Perino died in 1547, Tibaldi became the leader in the large-scale fresco painting of the chambers and doorways (1547\u20131549).  The frescoes are described as Michelangelesque in influence.\n Other works were for Cardinal Giovanni Poggi in Bologna, and he carried out numerous commissions for him. Tibaldi painted frescoes of the Story of Ulysses in the Palazzo Poggi, scenes from the life of the Baptist in the Poggi chapel, and scenes from the Life of Moses in the Palazzo Sacchetti in Rome.  He constructed a chapel for his patron, in the church of S. Giacomo Maggiore, and painted for it a St. John preaching in the Wilderness, and the Division of the Elect from the Damned. The Cardinal Poggi next employed him in the erection of a chapel in the Basilica della Santa Casa, Loreto, where he painted the Nativity, the Presentation in the Temple, the Transfiguration and Decollation of St. John.\n He lived in Ancona between 1558 and 1561. Here he painted frescoes for Loggia dei Mercanti[1] and Palazzo Ferretti. In 1561, he met Cardinal Carlo Borromeo, who employed him in Milan mostly as architect in the nearly endless task of constructing the cathedral, working on various projects in the cathedral, the courtyard of the archiepiscopal palace (1564\u201370), San Fedele (1569\u20131579) and San Sebastiano (1577). In Milan he worked also as a civil architect, projecting the Spinola, Erba Odescalchi and Prospero Visconti palaces. In 1575 he was commissioned by Cardinal Tolomeo Gallio the construction of Villa d'Este on the shores of Lake Como.\n In 1586 he went to Spain, where he followed and replaced Federico Zuccari as main court painter. He painted in the lower cloisters of El Escorial at the request of King Philip II. His greatest work were frescoes in the library.[1][2][3] After nine years, he returned to Italy and was appointed architect of the Duomo of Milan until his death in Milan in 1592.\n Pellegrino's brother, Domenico Pellegrino Tibaldi was an engraver active in Bologna. Among his pupils were Orazio Samacchini,[2] Lorenzo Sabbatini,[3] and Girolamo Miruoli.[4] His son Domenico Tibaldi is known mainly as an architect in Bologna.\n ", "tags": ["1527 births", "1596 deaths", "People from the Province of Como", "16th-century Italian architects", "Italian Renaissance architects", "Architects from Milan", "Italian muralists", "16th-century Italian painters", "Italian male painters", "Painters from Milan", "Mannerist painters", "16th-century Italian sculptors", "Italian male sculptors", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "No local image but image on Wikidata", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "CS1 maint: location", "Wikipedia articles with AAG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DSI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Pellegrino Tibaldi (Alessandro)Born1527Puria di Valsolda, Como, ItalyDied1596 (aged\u00a068\u201369)Known\u00a0forPaintingMovementRenaissanceSpouse(s)Lenneke Mekelhold\n Holy Family with St. Elizabeth, at the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg.\nPellegrino Tibaldi (Valsolda, 1527\u2013Milan, 1596), also known as Pellegrino di Tibaldo de Pellegrini, was an Italian mannerist architect, sculptor, and mural painter.\n\nBiography[edit]\nTibaldi was born in Puria di Valsolda, then part of the duchy of Milan, but grew up in Bologna.
