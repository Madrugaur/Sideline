{"name": "Karen Parshall", "content": "Karen Hunger Parshall (born 1955, Virginia; n\u00e9e Karen Virginia Hunger) is an American historian of mathematics.  She is the Commonwealth Professor of History and Mathematics at the University of Virginia with a joint appointment in the Corcoran Department of History and Department of Mathematics.[1] From 2009 to 2012, Parshall was the Associate Dean for the Social Sciences in the College of Arts in Sciences at UVA, and from 2016 to 2019 she was the chair of the Corcoran Department of History.[1]\n Parshall studied Romance languages, such as French, and mathematics at the University of Virginia, where she earned her master's degree in mathematics in 1978. She earned her PhD in 1982 in the history of mathematics from the University of Chicago under the direction of the historian Allen G. Debus (1926\u20132009) and the mathematician Israel Herstein. The subject of her dissertation was the history of the  theory of algebras, especially the work of Joseph Wedderburn (The contributions of J. H. M. Wedderburn to the theory of algebras, 1900\u20131910).[1]\n From 1982 to 1987, Parshall was an assistant professor at Sweet Briar College and in 1987/88 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Since 1988 she has taught the history of mathematics, and also mathematics and the history of science, at the University of Virginia, where she became in 1988 an assistant professor, in 1993 an associate professor and in 1999 a professor. She was a visiting professor at the Australian National University in Canberra, at the \u00c9cole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (1985 and 2010) and at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris (2016).\n Parshall's academic specialty is the development of mathematics in the USA in the late 19th century and early 20th century (particularly the Chicago School).[2] As one example, she has studied the work of Leonard Dickson,[3] who was greatly influenced by contact with German mathematicians such as Felix Klein at the time of the Columbian Exposition of 1893.[4] She has also focused on the history of algebra. She edited the correspondence of James Joseph Sylvester published by Oxford University Press and wrote a biography of Sylvester.\n In the academic year 1996/97 Parshall was a Guggenheim Fellow.[5] In 1994 she was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Z\u00fcrich (Mathematics in National Contexts (1875\u20131900): An International Overview). Since 2002 she has been a  corresponding member of the Acad\u00e9mie internationale d\u2019histoire des sciences in Paris. From 1996 to 1999, she was editor of the journal Historia Mathematica. Parshall was in the governing body of the History of Science Society and from 1998 to 2001 of the American Mathematical Society (AMS).\n In 2012, she became an inaugural fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[6] She is the 2018 winner of the Albert Leon Whiteman Memorial Prize of the American Mathematical Society \"for her outstanding work in the history of mathematics, and in particular, for her work on the evolution of mathematics in the USA and on the history of algebra, as well as for her substantial contribution to the international life of her discipline through students, editorial work, and conferences.\"[7]\n In 2020, she was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in the Section on Mathematics.[8]\n ", "tags": ["1955 births", "Living people", "20th-century American historians", "21st-century American historians", "21st-century American women writers", "Historians of mathematics", "University of Virginia alumni", "University of Chicago alumni", "Sweet Briar College faculty", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign faculty", "University of Virginia faculty", "American women historians", "Women mathematicians", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American historian of mathematics\nKaren Hunger Parshall (born 1955, Virginia; n\u00e9e Karen Virginia Hunger) is an American historian of mathematics.
