{"name": "Ruth Lawrence", "content": "Ruth Elke Lawrence-Neimark (Hebrew: \u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05dc\u05e7\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05e1-\u05e0\u05d0\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e7\u200e, born 2 August 1971) is a British\u2013Israeli mathematician and an associate professor of mathematics at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and a researcher in knot theory and algebraic topology. Outside academia, she is best known for having been a child prodigy in mathematics.\n Ruth Lawrence was born in Brighton, England. Her parents, Harry Lawrence and Sylvia Greybourne, were both computer consultants. When Lawrence was five, her father gave up his job so that he could educate her at home.[1]\n At the age of nine, Lawrence gained an O-level in mathematics, setting a new age record (later surpassed in 2001 when Arran Fernandez successfully sat GCSE mathematics aged five).[2] Also at the age of nine she achieved a Grade A at A-level pure mathematics.[1]\n In 1981 Lawrence passed the Oxford University entrance examination in mathematics, joining St Hugh's College in 1983 at the age of twelve.\n At Oxford, her father continued to be actively involved in her education, accompanying her to all lectures and some tutorials. Lawrence completed her bachelor's degree in two years, instead of the normal three, and graduated in 1985 at the age of 13 with a starred first and special commendation. Attracting considerable press interest, she became the youngest British person to gain a first-class degree, and the youngest to graduate from the University of Oxford in modern times.[1]\n Lawrence followed her first degree with a bachelor's degree in physics in 1986 and a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree in mathematics at Oxford in June 1989, at the age of 17. Her doctoral thesis title was Homology representations of braid groups and her thesis adviser was Sir Michael Atiyah.[3]\n Lawrence and her father moved to America for Lawrence's first academic post, which was at Harvard University, where she became a junior fellow in 1990 at the age of 19. In 1993, she moved to the University of Michigan, where she became an associate professor with tenure in 1997.\n In 1998, Lawrence married Ariyeh Neimark, a mathematician at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and adopted the name Ruth Lawrence-Neimark. The following year, she moved to Israel with him and took up the post of associate professor of mathematics at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics, a part of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.[1]\n Lawrence's 1990 paper, \"Homological representations of the Hecke algebra\", in Communications in Mathematical Physics, introduced, among other things, certain novel linear representations of the braid group\u00a0\u2014 known as Lawrence\u2013Krammer representations. In papers published in 2000 and 2001, Daan Krammer and Stephen Bigelow established the faithfulness of Lawrence's representation. This result goes by the phrase \"braid groups are linear.\"[4]\n In 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[5]\n ", "tags": ["1971 births", "20th-century British mathematicians", "21st-century British mathematicians", "Alumni of St Hugh's College, Oxford", "English mathematicians", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Harvard Fellows", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty", "Israeli mathematicians", "Living people", "Topologists", "University of Michigan faculty", "British women mathematicians", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from November 2018", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "British\u2013Israeli mathematician\nRuth LawrenceRuth Lawrence, Berkeley 1991Born (1971-08-02) 2 August 1971 (age\u00a049)Brighton, EnglandAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Oxford (MA, DPhil)Known\u00a0forBeing a child prodigyLawrence\u2013Krammer representationAwardsFellow of the American Mathematical SocietyScientific careerFieldsTopology, knot theoryInstitutionsHebrew University of JerusalemUniversity of MichiganDoctoral advisorMichael Atiyah\n\nRuth Elke Lawrence-Neimark (Hebrew: \u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05dc\u05e7\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05e1-\u05e0\u05d0\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e7\u200e, born 2 August 1971) is a British\u2013Israeli mathematician and an associate professor of mathematics at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and a researcher in knot theory and algebraic topology.
