After earning a master's degree in statistics at the University of Texas at El Paso in 1988, she returned to mathematics for her doctoral studies, completing a Ph.D. at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1992.[4] Her dissertation, Generalized Convolutions, was supervised by Svetlozar Rachev.[5]\n She became an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 1992, but left academia in 1997 to work as a biostatistician for BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee. After visiting the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1999\u20132000, she took a research faculty position in 2000 at the Desert Research Institute, associated with the University of Nevada, Reno.
