{"name": "Susan Montgomery", "content": "M. Susan Montgomery (born 2 April 1943 in Lansing, MI) is a distinguished American mathematician whose current research interests concern noncommutative algebras:  in particular, Hopf algebras, their structure and representations,  and their actions on other algebras. Her early research was on group actions on rings.\n Montgomery received her B.A. in 1965 from the University of Michigan and her Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1969 under the supervision of I. N. Herstein.\n Upon receiving her Ph.D. from Chicago, Montgomery spent one year on the faculty at DePaul University.  Montgomery joined the faculty of the University of Southern California (USC) in 1970 and was promoted to the rank of Professor in 1982. She was chair of the Department of Mathematics at USC \nfrom 1996 to 1999.[1] Montgomery has spent sabbaticals at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the University of Leeds, the University of Wisconsin, the University of Munich, the University of New South Wales, the Mittag-Leffler Institute, and the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute.\n Montgomery wrote about a hundred research articles and several books, of which Hopf algebras and their actions on rings is her most cited work. This book includes a discussion of Hopf-Galois theory, an area to which Montgomery has significantly contributed, and an introduction to quantum group theory.\n Montgomery was awarded a Guggenheim Foundation[2] Fellowship in 1984 and a Raubenheimer Outstanding Faculty Award by USC in 1987.\n She gave an American Mathematical Society (AMS) Invited Address at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in 1984.  In 1995 she gave an Invited Address at the  Joint AMS-Israel Math Union Meeting in Jerusalem.[3] \nIn 2009, she gave a plenary lecture at the summer meeting of the Canadian Mathematical Society.[4] She has also given numerous lectures at meetings and universities around the world.\n Montgomery was the Principal Lecturer at the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) 1992 Conference on Hopf Algebras. Her CBMS monograph Hopf Algebras and their Actions on Rings[5] is highly cited.  She has written one other book and has edited five collections of research articles.\n She served as an editor for the Journal of Algebra for over 20 years. She was also an editor for the AMS Proceedings, AMS Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, and Advances in Mathematics, and currently is on the editorial boards of Algebras and Representation Theory[6] and of Algebra and Number Theory.[7]\n Montgomery has been very active in the American Mathematical Society, serving on the Board of Trustees from 1986\u20131996.[8] She has also served on the Council, the Policy Committee on Publications,[9] and on the Nominating Committee.[10] \nIn 2013 she was elected to a 3-year term as a Vice-President of the American Mathematical Society.[11]  She was also a member of the National Research Council's Board on Mathematical Sciences and Their Applications (BMSA), serving one year on the Executive Committee.\n Montgomery has been active in the Association for Women in Mathematics for 35 years. She was a member of the Executive Committee from 1975\u20131976. She served on the Nominating Committee in 1982 (as chair) and again in 2009.[12]  In 2011 she was selected to deliver the Association for Women in Mathematics Noether Lecture.[13][14]\n In 2012 she was selected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society[15][16] and a Fellow of the AAAS.[17][18]\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "People from Lansing, Michigan", "University of Chicago alumni", "University of Southern California faculty", "University of Michigan alumni", "Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "American women mathematicians", "1943 births", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "CS1 errors: requires URL", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nFor American bubblegum-blower, see Susan Montgomery Williams.\nM.
