Her research area is geometric group theory; in particular, she studies quasi-isometry invariants of groups.\n Dani received a B.Sc. degree in mathematics from the University of Mumbai in Mumbai, India.  She earned an M.S. in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 2001 and her Ph.D. in mathematics from Chicago in 2005.[1] Her dissertation \"Statistical properties of elements in infinite group\" was directed by Benson Farb.[2]\n After completing her Ph.D. at Chicago, Dani held postdoctoral positions at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma and Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Dani joined the tenure stream faculty at Louisiana State in 2009. She is currently an associate professor of mathematics at LSU.\n Dani delivered a series of invited lectures on geometric group theory at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California in June of 2015.[3]\n She served on the American Mathematical Society-Simons Travel Grants Committee from 2015 to 2017.
