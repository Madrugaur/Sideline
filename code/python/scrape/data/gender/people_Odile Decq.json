{"name": "Odile Decq", "content": "Odile Decq (born 1955 in Laval, France) is a French architect, urban planner and academic. She is the founder of the Paris firm, Studio Odile Decq[1] and the architecture school, Confluence Institute.[2] Decq is known for her unique, self-described goth appearance and style.[3]\n In the 1970s, Odile Decq first entered \u00c9cole R\u00e9gionale d'Architecture de Rennes. She was told by the first year director that she would never become an architect because she did not possess the right spirit. She completed two years at Rennes, then moved to Paris, where she enrolled at La Villette (formerly called UP6). Because of the Revolution of 1968, Decq spent a lot of time on strike, instead of in class.\n In order to finance her education, she began to work for writer Philippe Boudon. Boudon was writing about theory of architecture at that time, and was interested in Decq because of her studies in literature and linguistics. Decq began reading for Boudon, and later went on writing for him. After four years, Decq resigned from her job with Boudon to pursue her diploma. [2]\n She graduated in 1978 from \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'architecture de Paris-La Villette with a diploma in urban planning from the Paris Institute of Political Studies in 1979.\n Decq opened her own firm in 1979. Her future partner in the firm and in life,  Beno\u00eet Cornette, was studying medicine at the time. In 1985 Cornette earned a degree in architecture and the couple established the architecture firm ODBC.[4] The buildings they completed for the Banque Populaire de l\u2019Ouest in Rennes with Peter Rice in 1990 brought them numerous awards and international recognition. It was the first metal-construction office building in France.[4]\n Model building is especially important to her process. Decq and Beno\u00eet would create models with modular parts that could be moved in order to test the feasibility of various configurations.[4]\n Decq has stated that her philosophy on architecture is that a building \" has to be a place where people can move, live in good conditions, forget the hardness of the life outside, so it has to have a kind of humanistic approach...\"[5]\n She has \"been faithful to her fighting attitude while diversifying and radicalizing her research.\"[6] Being awarded the Golden Lion of Architecture during the Venice Biennale in 1996 acknowledged her early and unusual career. Other than just a style, an attitude or a process, Odile Decq\u2019s work materializes a complete universe that embraces urban planning, architecture, design and art. Her multidisciplinary approach was recently recognized with the Jane Drew Prize in 2016, and Architizer\u2019s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2017.[6]\n Since 1992, Odile Decq has been a professor at the \u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale d\u2019Architecture in Paris where she was elected head of the Department of Architecture in 2007. She left in 2012 and subsequently designed and opened her own school, Confluence Institute for Innovation and Creative Strategies in Architecture, in Lyon, France.[7] in 2014. Odile Decq co-founded and led the school along with architect Matteo Cainer.[8] She describes her approach to education as forcing students to take a strong position to foster their independence and ability to \"express themselves strongly and very clearly.\"[9]\n In 1998 Cornette died in a car accident at the age of 45. Decq continued to work under the firm ODBC, but in 2013 changed the name to Studio Odile Decq. The name change was prompted by her late husband still being credited with buildings that were solely her design.[10]\n ", "tags": ["1955 births", "Living people", "People from Laval, Mayenne", "21st-century French architects", "French women architects", "Sciences Po alumni", "Columbia University faculty", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al faculty", "Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Commandeurs of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres", "CS1 maint: others", "CS1 errors: dates", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with suppressed authority control identifiers"], "raw": "Odile DecqOdile Decq at GSAPPBorn1955 (age\u00a065\u201366)Laval, FranceNationalityFrenchOccupationArchitectPracticeStudio Odile Decq\nWebsitewww.odiledecq.com\nOdile Decq (born 1955 in Laval, France) is a French architect, urban planner and academic.
