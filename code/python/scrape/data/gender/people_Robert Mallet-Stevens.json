{"name": "Robert Mallet-Stevens", "content": "Robert Mallet-Stevens (March 24, 1886 \u2013 February 8, 1945) was an influential French architect and designer. \n Mallet-Stevens was born in Paris in a house called Maison-Laffitte (designed by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart in the 17th century). His father and his grandfather were art collectors in Paris and Brussels. He received his formal training at the \u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale d'Architecture in Paris, during which he wrote Guerande about relationships between the different forms of art.\n In 1924 Mallet-Stevens published a magazine called La Gazette Des 7 Arts and at the same time with the help of Ricciotto Canudo founded the Club des amis du 7\u00e8me art. A Paris street in the 16th arrondissement, Rue Mallet-Stevens, was built by him in the 1920s and has on it six houses designed by him.[1]\n A portfolio of 32 of Mallet-Stevens' designs was published under the title Une Cit\u00e9 Moderne in 1922.[2] In addition to designing shops, factories, a fire station in Paris, apartment buildings, private homes, and interiors, he was one of the first architects to show an interest in cinema. He designed film sets and his design for Marcel L'Herbier's silent film L'Inhumaine (1924) is considered a masterpiece.\n In 1929, surrealist photographer and filmmaker Man Ray made a film inspired by his design for the buildings named \"Villa Noailles\" entitled The Mysteries of the Ch\u00e2teau de D\u00e9.\n During his career he assembled a team of artisans and craftspeople who worked with him: interior designers, sculptors, master glaziers, lighting specialists, and ironsmiths.[3]  An example of his collaborative nature is provided by the Union des Artistes Moderne (UAM), formed in 1929 by a group of 25 dissidents of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes-D\u00e9corateurs (SAD), and presided over by Robert.\n Mallet-Stevens ordered that his archives be destroyed upon his death. His wishes were honored and his memory fell into obscurity. A French exhibit of his drawings, models, and actual works at the Centre Pompidou in 2005 sparked public interest in his contributions.\n ", "tags": ["20th-century French architects", "Artists from Paris", "1886 births", "1945 deaths", "Burials at Passy Cemetery", "\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale d'Architecture alumni", "Modernist architects from France", "Art Deco architects", "Articles with French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with suppressed authority control identifiers"], "raw": "French architect and designer\nRobert Mallet-StevensVilla CavroisBornMarch 24, 1886ParisDiedFebruary 8, 1945ParisNationalityFrenchOccupationArchitectBuildingsVilla CavroisVilla Noailles\n\n Villa Paul Poiret, 1921-1923\n Villa Noailles\n H\u00f4tel Martel rue Mallet-Stevens, 1926-1927\n Immeuble de rapport du 7 rue M\u00e9chain in ParisRobert Mallet-Stevens (March 24, 1886 \u2013 February 8, 1945) was an influential French architect and designer. \nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Legacy\n4 Buildings and projects\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nMallet-Stevens was born in Paris in a house called Maison-Laffitte (designed by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart in the 17th century).
