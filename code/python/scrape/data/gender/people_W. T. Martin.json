{"name": "W. T. Martin", "content": "William Ted Martin (June 4, 1911 \u2013 May 30, 2004), known as \"Ted Martin\", was an American mathematician, who worked on mathematical analysis, several complex variables, and probability theory. He is known for the Cameron\u2013Martin theorem and for his 1948 book Several complex variables, co-authored with Salomon Bochner.\n He was born on June 4, 1911 in Arkansas.\n W. T. Martin received his B.A. in mathematics from the University of Arkansas in 1930. He did graduate work at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, where he received his M.A. in 1931 and his Ph.D. in 1934 under the direction of Robert Carmichael.[1] He studied under a National Research Council postdoctoral fellowship at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton from 1934 to 1936.[2] In 1936 Martin became an instructor at MIT and in 1938 a faculty member there. He collaborated with several fellow MIT faculty members, notably Norbert Wiener, R. H. Cameron, Stefan Bergman, and Salomon Bochner. During the 1940s Martin and R. H. Cameron wrote a series of papers extending Norbert Wiener's early work on mathematical models of Brownian motion.[3] During the 1950s W. T. Martin wrote with Salomon Bochner a series of papers that proved basic results in the theory of several complex variables.\n Martin was the department head for the MIT mathematics department from 1947 to 1968. During this time he oversaw the hiring of 24 faculty members in the mathematics department. He initiated MIT's C. L. E. Moore Instructorship Program in 1949.[4] He spent his entire career at MIT, except for the years from 1943 to 1946, when he left MIT to become the head of the mathematics department of Syracuse University[5] and, in the academic year 1951\u20131952, when he was on sabbatical at the Institute for Advanced Study.[2] Martin did important editorial work and co-authored three influential books: Several complex variables (1948), Elementary differential equations (1956), and Differential space, quantum space, and prediction (1966).[5] Beginning in 1961, Martin involved himself in developing math curricula for English-speaking African nations, serving as chair of the Steering Committee of the Education Development Center's African Mathematics Program and visited Africa regularly from 1961 to 1975.[6]\n He retired to Block Island and died on May 30, 2004.[5]\n ", "tags": ["1911 births", "2004 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Probability theorists", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty", "Syracuse University faculty", "University of Arkansas alumni", "University of Illinois alumni", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nW.
