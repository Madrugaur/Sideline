{"name": "Lao Genevra Simons", "content": "Lao Genevra Simons (1870\u20131949) also referred to as Lao G. Simons, was an American mathematician, writer, and historian of mathematics known for her influential book Fabre and Mathematics and Other Essays. Simons was   head of the mathematics department at Hunter College in New York.\n Lao Genevra Simons was born on March 25, 1870 in San Jose, California. When Simons was six months old, her family moved west to New Jersey.[1]\n Upon retiring from Hunter College, Simons founded a $1000 scholarship for the university named after the mathematics honour society, Pi Mu Epsilon. A second graduate scholarship was created in her name, funded by friends, alumnae, and admirers, in the same year.[2]\n Simons died on November 25, 1949 in Greenwich, Connecticut at age 79 of natural causes.[1][2]\n As a child, Simons attended school in New Jersey. She later obtained a teaching certificate from the College for the Training of Teachers at Columbia University and later studied astronomy and mathematics for a year at Vassar College.[3]\n Simons earned a bachelor of science in 1908 from Columbia University; she attained a master\u2019s degree and a Ph.D. also from Columbia in 1912 and 1924 respectively.[3] Her Ph.D. was obtained with a major in education and a minor in mathematics. Simons' doctoral thesis was entitled Introduction of algebra into American schools in the eighteenth century.[4]\n After obtaining her teaching certificate she taught at a preparatory school in Connecticut, then taught elementary school for a year in South Orange, New Jersey.[3]\n Simons was hired at a mathematics professor at Hunter College in 1895. This appointment did not require a bachelor's degree, which Simons did not have at the time of her initial hiring. In 1916, she became an assistant professor and in 1925, she became an associate professor. Simons would later be promoted to professor and head of the mathematics department at Hunter College in 1928.[2]\n At Hunter College, Simons was Chairman of Student Activities from 1934, when the committee was initially founded, until 1940.[2] Simons taught elective courses in mathematics, including advanced classes in pure mathematics and classes in the history of mathematics, in addition to required classes; Simons was one of the first mathematics professors at Hunter to do so. Simons worked at Hunter College until her retirement in 1940.[3]\n Simons was elected a member of the American Mathematical Society in September 1923.[5] Simons was also a member of the Council of The History of Science Society.[6] As part of the Council, Simons was part of the committee on arrangements for the meeting and exhibition commemorating the bi-centenary of the death of Sir Isaac Newton.[7]\n Simons wrote articles about math history for Scripta Mathematica, The Mathematics Teacher, and the American Mathematical Monthly. Simons was an associate editor for Scripta Mathematica,[8] and from 1932, the founding year of the journal, to 1949 she served as its Book Review Editor.[3][2]\n ", "tags": ["1870 births", "1949 deaths", "People from San Jose, California", "20th-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "Historians of mathematics", "Columbia University alumni", "Hunter College faculty", "Vassar College alumni", "American women academics", "American women non-fiction writers", "20th-century American women writers", "20th-century American non-fiction writers", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician, writer\nLao Genevra SimonsBorn(1870-03-25)25 March 1870San Jose, California, United StatesDied25 November 1949(1949-11-25) (aged\u00a079)Greenwich, Connecticut, United StatesNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materColumbia UniversityKnown\u00a0forAuthor of Fabre and Mathematics and Other EssaysScientific careerFieldsMathematics, history of scienceInstitutionsHunter College\n\nLao Genevra Simons (1870\u20131949) also referred to as Lao G.
