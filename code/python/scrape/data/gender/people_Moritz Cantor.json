{"name": "Moritz Cantor", "content": "Moritz Benedikt Cantor (23 August 1829 \u2013 10 April 1920) was a German historian of mathematics.\n Cantor was born at Mannheim. He came from a Sephardi Jewish family that had emigrated to the Netherlands from Portugal, another branch of which had established itself in Russia. In his early youth, Moritz Cantor was not strong enough to go to school, and his parents decided to educate him at home. Later, however, he was admitted to an advanced class of the Gymnasium in Mannheim. From there he went to the University of Heidelberg in 1848, and soon after to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he studied under Gauss and Weber, and where Stern awakened in him a strong interest in historical research.\n After obtaining his Ph.D. at the University of Heidelberg in 1851, he went to Berlin, where he eagerly followed the lectures of Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet; and upon his return to Heidelberg in 1853, he was appointed privat-docent at the university. In 1863, he was promoted to the position of assistant professor, and in 1877 he became honorary professor.\n Cantor was one of the founders of the Kritische Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Chemie, Physik und Mathematik. In 1859 he became associated with Schl\u00f6milch as editor of the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik, taking charge of the historical and literary section.
