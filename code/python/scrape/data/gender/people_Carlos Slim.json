{"name": "Carlos Slim", "content": "\n Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa (Spanish pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8ka\u027elos ez\u02c8lim e\u02c8lu]; born January 28, 1940 in Mexico City) is a Mexican business magnate, investor and philanthropist.[2][3] From 2010 to 2013, Slim was ranked as the richest person in the world by the Forbes business magazine.[4][5] He derived his fortune from his extensive holdings in a considerable number of Mexican companies through his conglomerate, Grupo Carso.[6] As of April 2021, he was ranked at twenty-fourth richest person in the world according to Bloomberg L.P. listing of Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a net worth estimated at $53.1 billion.[1] He is the richest person in Latin America.[1]\n His conglomerate includes education, health care, industrial manufacturing, transportation, real estate, media, energy, hospitality, entertainment, high-technology, retail, sports and financial services.[2][3][7][8]  He accounts for 40% of the listings on the Mexican Stock Exchange,[7] while his net worth is equivalent to about 6 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product.[9] As of 2016, he is the largest single shareholder of The New York Times Company.\n Slim was born on January 28, 1940, in Mexico City,[10] to Juli\u00e1n Slim Haddad (born Khalil Salim Haddad Aglamaz) and Linda Hel\u00fa Atta, both Maronite Christians from Lebanon.[11][12][13] He decided at a young age that he wanted to be a businessman,[5][14]\nand received business lessons from his father, who taught him finance, management and accounting, teaching him how to read financial statements as well as the importance of keeping accurate financial records.[15]\n At the age of 11, Slim invested in a government savings bond that taught him about the concept of compound interest. He eventually saved every financial and business transaction he made into a personal ledger book, which he still keeps.[16]\nAt the age of 12, he made his first stock purchase, of shares in a Mexican bank.[17] By the age of 15, Slim had become a shareholder in Mexico's largest bank.[9] At the age of 17, he earned 200 pesos a week working for his father's company.[18] He went on to study civil engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he also concurrently taught algebra and linear programming.[19][20][21]\n Though Slim was a civil engineering major, he also displayed an interest in economics. He took economics courses in Chile once he finished his engineering degree.[14] Graduating as a civil engineering major, Slim has stated that his mathematical ability and his background of linear programming was a key factor in helping him gain an edge in the business world, especially when reading financial statements.[15][22][23]\n After graduating from college in 1961, Slim began his career as a stock trader in Mexico, often working 14-hour days.[5] In 1965, profits from Slim's private investments reached US$400,000,[24] allowing him to start the stock brokerage Inversora Burs\u00e1til.[21] In addition, he also began laying the financial groundwork for Grupo Carso.[25] In 1965 he also bought Jarritos del Sur. In 1966, worth US$40\u00a0million,[24][26] he founded Inmobiliaria Carso.\n Companies in the construction, soft drink, printing, real estate, bottling and mining industries were the focus of Slim's early burgeoning business career.[9]  He later expanded into numerous industries including auto parts, aluminium, airlines, chemicals, tobacco, manufacturing of cables and wires, paper and packaging, copper and mineral extraction, tires, cement, retail, hotels, beverage distributors, telecommunications and financial services where Slim's Grupo Financiero Inbursa \u2013 which sells insurance and invests the savings, mutual funds and pension plans of millions of ordinary Mexicans.[25][27]  By 1972, he had established or acquired a further seven businesses in these categories, including one which rented construction equipment. In 1976, he branched out by acquiring a 60 percent share of Galas de M\u00e9xico, a small printer of cigarette-pack labels for US$1\u00a0million, and in 1980, he consolidated his business interests by forming Grupo Galas as the parent company of a conglomerate that had interests in industry, construction, mining, retail, food, and tobacco.[19] In 1981, Slim acquired a majority stake in Cigarros la Tabacelera Mexicana (Cigatam), Mexico's second largest producer and marketer of cigarettes, at a reduced price.[5]\n In 1982, the Mexican economy contracted rapidly. As many banks were struggling and foreign investors were cutting back on investing and scurrying, Slim began investing heavily and bought many flagship companies at depressed valuations.[5] Buying troubled assets at depressed prices to resell them later at an attractive price is a business strategy that Slim has executed throughout his career.[9][28]\n Having a keen investment eye for value, Slim adhered to his value investment practices with a long history of buying stakes in companies he sees as undervalued.[29] Much of Slim's business dealings involved a simple strategy, which is to buy a business and hang on to it for its cash flow or eventually sell the stake at a greater profit in future, thereby netting the capital gains as well as reinvesting the initial principal into a new business.[30] In addition, his conglomerate structure allows Slim to purchase numerous stakes that it is made nearly recession proof if one or more sectors of the economy do not do well. \n From the mid 1960s to the early 1980s, Slim and his growing family lived a modest life, while earnings from Slim's many businesses were re-invested in expansion and more acquisitions. Slim acquired companies with strong returns on capital he believed were undervalued and overhauled their management. He diversified methodically in numerous industry sectors across the Mexican economy, investing in real estate, then a construction equipment company, and mining companies. The portfolio of Slim companies grew to include a printing company, a tobacco company and retail stores.[21]\n During the Mexican economic downturn before its recovery in 1985, Slim invested heavily. He bought all or a large percentage of numerous Mexican businesses, including Empresas Frisco, a mining and chemicals company producing silver, gold, copper, lead, and zinc from extracted ores, and also chemical products such as hydrofluoric acid and molybdenum for only $50 million, Industrias Nacobre, a manufacturer of copper products, Reynolds Aluminio, Compania Hulera Euzkadi, Mexico's largest tire maker, Bimex hotels, and majority share of Sanborn Hermanos food retailer, gift shop and restaurant chain. Slim spent US$13\u00a0million to buy insurance company Seguros de M\u00e9xico in 1984, and later absorbed the company into the firm, Seguros Inbursa.[21] The value of his stake in Seguros eventually became worth US$1.5\u00a0billion by 2007, after four spinoffs.[31] He also acquired a 40% and 50% interest in the Mexican arms of British American Tobacco and The Hershey Company, respectively as well as acquiring large blocks of Denny's and Firestone Tires. He moved into financial services as well, buying Seguros de M\u00e9xico and creating from it, along with other purchases such as Fianzas La Guardiana and Casa de Bolsa Inbursa, the Grupo Financiero Inbursa. Many of these acquisitions were financed by the revenues and cash flows from Cigatam, a tobacco business which he bought early in the economic downturn.[17][19]\n In 1988, Slim bought the Nacobre group of companies, which trades in copper and aluminum products, along with a chemicals business, Qu\u00edmica Fluor, and others.[19]\n Slim made a large fortune in the early 1990s when Mexico privatized its telecom industry and Grupo Carso acquired Telmex from the Mexican government.[9] In 1990 the Grupo Carso was floated as a public company initially in Mexico and then worldwide.[19] Grupo Carso also acquired majority ownership of Porcelanite, a tile making company in 1990. This investment was assigned to an associated company, but in 1995 Grupo Carso began growing its equity stake to 83 percent and subsequently made it a subsidiary.[17]\n Later in 1990, Slim acted in concert with France T\u00e9l\u00e9com and Southwestern Bell Corporation in order to buy the landline telephone company Telmex from the Mexican government, when Mexico began privatizing its national industries.[19] Slim was one of the initial investors of Telmex, the revenues of the company eventually formed the bulk of Slim's wealth.[30][32] By 2006, 90 percent of the telephone lines in Mexico were operated by Telmex, and his mobile telephone company, Telcel, which was created out of the Radiom\u00f3vil Dipsa company,[19] operated almost 80 percent of all the country's cellphones.[33] By 2012, Am\u00e9rica Movil, Slim's mobile telephone company, had taken over Telmex and made it into a privately held subsidiary.[30]\n In 1991, he acquired Hoteles Calinda (now OSTAR Grupo Hotelero), and in 1993, he increased his stakes in General Tire and Grupo Aluminio to the point where he had a majority interest.[19]\n In 1996, Grupo Carso was split into three companies: Carso Global Telecom, Grupo Carso, and Invercorporaci\u00f3n. In the following year, Slim bought the Mexican arm of Sears Roebuck.[19] In July 1997 Grupo Carso agreed in principle to sell Procter & Gamble de M\u00e9xico, a subsidiary of The Procter & Gamble Co., a manufacturing plant in Apizaco and the company's Lypps, Pampys, and other toilet-tissue brands for about US$170\u00a0million but kept its tissue-products company F\u00e1bricas de Papel Loreto y Pe\u00f1a Pobre.[17]\n In 1999, Slim began expanding his business interests beyond Latin America. Though the bulk of his holdings still remained in Mexico, he began setting his sights towards the United States for overseas investments.\n Slim became a prominent figure within the American business scene by 2003 when he began purchasing large stakes in a number of major US retailers such as Barnes & Noble, OfficeMax, Office Depot, Circuit City, Borders, and CompUSA.[34] Much of the reason behind Slim's international expansion was due to a running joke in the Mexican business scene where \"there was nothing left to acquire in Mexico\".[34]  He eyed towards investing the United States where he set up Telmex USA and also acquired a stake in Tracfone, a US cellular telephone company. At the same time, he established Carso Infraestructura y Construcci\u00f3n, S. A. (CICSA) as a construction and engineering company within Grupo Carso.[19] During the same year, Slim had heart surgery and subsequently passed on much of the day-to-day involvement in the businesses to his children and their spouses.[33]\n Am\u00e9rica Telecom, the holding company for Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, was incorporated in 2000. It took stakes in cellular telephone companies outside of Mexico, including the Brazilian ATL and Telecom Americas concerns, Techtel in Argentina, and others in Guatemala and Ecuador. In subsequent years, there were investment in Latin America, with companies in Colombia, Nicaragua, Peru, Chile, Honduras, and El Salvador, as well as a venture with Microsoft.\n In 2005 Slim invested in Volaris, a Mexican airline[19] and established Impulsora del Desarrollo y el Empleo en Am\u00e9rica Latina SAB de CV (using the acronym \"IDEAL\"\u2014roughly translated as \"Promoter of Development and Employment in Latin America\"), a Mexican construction and civil engineering company primarily engaged in not-for-profit infrastructure development.  Since 2006,  IDEAL won three infrastructure contracts yet it faces stiff competition from a number of other Mexican and Spanish construction companies. The number of contracts is fewer than its biggest local competitor, Empresas ICA. During the same period, Empresas obtained 18 Mexican projects valued at US$1.09\u00a0billion, including airports, toll roads, hospitals and oil platforms. Some of the projects IDEAL has been awarded include the Nezahualcoyotl development, which is a landfill that was acquired for US$150\u00a0million by Slim to develop a shopping mall, two schools, a hospital and a park on the site. Other contracts IDEAL has been awarded include a water-treatment plant contract, and a real estate partnership with the Mexican hospital chain Star M\u00e9dica. IDEAL is also betting on one of the poorest landfills surrounding Mexico City. Slim has also planned to purchase several toll roads offered by the Mexican government that it took over from private companies following the December 1994 currency devaluation.[35] Though speculation that the landfill will take about 12 years to yield a return, the development of a such poor area is revealed to promise handsome business profits over the years as Grupo Elektra, Mexico's largest consumer electronics retailer, sells 2,000 flat screen televisions a year at its store in the area, making it the third-best-selling outlet. Included in the development, IDEAL will also collect rent from a university, a hospital and a school that will be built around a mall, will have 178 stores, including Inditex's Zara fashion chain and Slim's Grupo Sanborns and the Mexican unit of Sears Holdings. A park in Nezahualcoyotl, the first of its kind will also be constructed. The park will comprise 34 soccer fields, 12 tennis, basketball and volleyball courts, a baseball field and a gym with a swimming pool.[7][35]\n In 2007, after having amassed a 50.1% stake in the Cigatam tobacco company, Slim reduced his holdings by selling a large portion of his equity to Philip Morris for US$1.1\u00a0billion, while in the same year also selling his entire interest in a tile company, Porcelanite, for US$800\u00a0million. He licensed the Saks name and opened the Mexican arm of Saks Fifth Avenue in Santa Fe, Mexico. During the same year, the estimated value of all of Slim's companies was at US$150\u00a0billion.[21] On December 8, 2007, Grupo Carso announced that the remaining 103 CompUSA stores would be either liquidated or sold, bringing an end to the struggling company,[36] although the IT tech part of CompUSA continued under the name Telvista with U.S. locations in Dallas, Texas (U.S. Corporate Office) and Danville, Virginia. Telvista has five centers in Mexico (three in Tijuana, one center in Mexicali, and one in M\u00e9xico City).[37] After 28 years, Slim became the Honorary Lifetime Chairman of the business.\n In 2008 Slim took a 6.4% stake valued at $27 million in the troubled New York Times Company, as the global recession and declining advertising revenues took a particularly heavy toll on print-based \"old media\" companies across the United States.[19] Slim increased his stake to 8% by 2012.[38] Slim's stake in the Times increased again to 16.8% of the company's Class A shares on January 20, 2015 when he exercised stock options to purchase 15.9 million shares, making him the largest shareholder in the company.[39][40] The New York Times Company's Class A shares are available for purchase by the public and offer less control over the company than Class B shares, which are privately held.[39] According to the company's 2016 annual filings, Slim owned 17.4% of the company's Class A shares, and none of the company's Class B shares.[41]\n Slim built Plaza Carso in Mexico City, where most of his ventures share a common headquarters address.[42]\n In 2012 Slim sold the broadcast rights for the Leon games to Telemundo in the United States, and the cable channel Fox Sports in Mexico and the rest of Latin America and to the website mediotiempo.com. The games are also broadcast on the Internet through UNO TV, offered by Telmex. Slim has been involved with broadcasting sports outside Mexico to larger markets such as the United States. In March 2012, Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil acquired the broadcast rights for the Olympic Games in Sochi 2014 and the Brazil 2016 for Latin America.[43]\n In March 2012, Slim, along with American television host Larry King, established Ora TV, an on-demand digital television network that produces and distributes television shows including Larry King Now, Politicking with Larry King, Recessionista, and Jesse Ventura Uncensored.[44]\n In September 2012, Slim bought 30% stakes in Pachuca and Le\u00f3n, two Mexican soccer teams through his telecommunications company America Movil. In December 2012, he bought all the shares of the second division team Estudiantes Tecos.[45] Slim has also completed business deals for the television rights to games of the Leon soccer team. His company America Movil purchased 30 percent of the team along with transmission rights as Slim doesn't have the rights to transmit content by broadcast television or cable TV as well as putting him in competition with Televisa and TV Azteca, two television companies with rights to the rest of Mexican soccer's first division.[46]\n In 2013, Slim's company, Grupo Carso opened Mexico City's Telcel Theater, which operates in conjunction with his entertainment company, Grupo CIE (Corporaci\u00f3n Interamericana de Entretenimiento), Mexico's equivalent of Live Nation.[47]\n In April 2013, Slim entered the business of managing Mexican prisons to expand the investments of his construction-finance company. Ideal acquired stakes in two federal prisons from Desarrolladora Homex SAB, a Mexican homebuilder where Slim's companies are to receive 4 billion pesos (US$326\u00a0million) within the agreement. The company run by his son, Marco Antonio Slim, added the prisons to its portfolio of infrastructure assets among which include toll roads, hydroelectric dams, and water-treatment plants.[48]\n In July 2013, Slim's company America Movill invested US$40\u00a0million in Shazam, a British commercial mobile phone-based music identification service for an undisclosed share of ownership. America Movil partnered with the company to aid its growth into advertising and television and help the audio recognition service expand in Latin America.[49][50]\n In November 2013, Slim invested US$60 million in the Israeli startup Mobli, a company that deals with connections between people and communities corralled according to different interests.\n In December 2013, Slim's private equity fund, Sinca Inbursa, sold its stake in Mexican pharmaceutical company Landsteiner Scientific. Slim had acquired a 27.51 stake in the company in June 2008, which represented 6.6 percent of Sinca's investment portfolio. The private equity fund's investments are mainly in transportation and infrastructure and the fund had a total market cap of 5.152 billion pesos at the end of 2012.[51]\n Slim was criticized by the Dutch minister of economic affairs, Henk Kamp, in 2013 for attempting to expand his telecom empire beyond the Americas by Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil's buy-out offer to KPN, a Dutch landline and mobile telecommunications company privatized in the 1990s, by stating \"an acquisition of KPN by a 'foreign company' could have consequences for the Netherlands' national security\".[52] Two years after Slim's failed bid to take over the company mainly due to political intervention and Slim's paucity of interest in purchasing the company, Slim's America Movil SAB began offering 2.25\u00a0billion euros of bonds that can be converted into shares of Royal KPN NV. America Movil now controls a 21.1 percent stake of KPN with a market value of 3.1\u00a0billion euros as of May 20, 2015. Slim has been slowly decreasing his holdings since he was forced to withdraw a 7.2-billion-euro bid for the Dutch phone line carrier in 2013 after negotiations broke down and KPN's preference share foundation blocked the takeover attempt.[53]\n Slim has also set his sights within the energy industry as well. In 2011, Slim began buying a 70 percent stake in Geoprocesados SA's Tabasco Oil Co., gaining access to the Colombian oil market as the country seeks to boost crude and natural-gas output.[54] Slim began seeking to boost his oil investments in Colombia because of the country's open policies on exploration as well as furthering its commitment to double output by 2020.[55] Investors have also been drawn to Colombia because of improved security as well as a clear government regulatory framework for oil drilling.[56] In 2013, Mexico's national oil and gas company Pemex hired an offshore drilling rig from the Carso Group. Under the agreement, Pemex will operate the rig on a seven-year contract and will pay US$415\u00a0million. The rig is owned by Operadora Cicsa, a subsidiary of Carso Group.[57] The relationship between Pemex and Slim rans back as early as in 2006, where NOC hired CICSA for the drilling and completion of over 60 wells in the southern region\u200d\u2014\u200ccovering the Cinco Presidentes, Macuspana-Muspac, Samaria-Luna and Bellota-Jujo assets \u2013 and for the expansion of a petrochemical plant in Veracruz. Carso's infrastructure and construction subsidiary has been awarded with several oil well development contracts in Pemex's main assets\u200d\u2014\u200cincluding Chicontepec\u200d\u2014\u200cas well as tenders for the construction of natural gas pipelines and marine platforms. With the 2008 Pemex Law reform, the creation of integrated service contracts and the perspectives for a future energy reform, Slim has begun seizing business and investment opportunities in Mexico's oil and gas industry.  CICSA's pipe manufacturing division Swepomex into a marine platform provider. CICSA has also acquired majority shares in Oklahoma contractor Bronco Drilling, along with minority participations in Houston drilling company Allis Chalmers Energy. Slim controls a 15 percent stake in Bronco, with warrants that could boost the stake to 20 percent. He also has a 2.9 percent stake in Allis-Chalmers.[56] 15% of the country's main gas operator, Gas Natural Mexico now belong to Sinca Inbursa, a private equity fund controlled by Slim.[51] Slim Hel\u00fa has also maintained an important business presence in Spanish oil company Repsol and its Argentinian subsidiary YPF, Argentina's largest oil company, where Slim has an 8.4 percent stake.[3][29]\n On April 23, 2014, Slim took control of Telekom Austria, Austria's biggest phone carrier, which has telcos in countries such as Bulgaria, Croatia and Belarus, under a 10-year agreement, was Slim's first successful business acquisition in Europe. In a syndicate holding structure the Austrian state holding company OIAG's 28 percent are combined with Slim's 27 percent ownership. America Movil will spend as much as US$2\u00a0billion to buy out minority shareholders in a mandatory public offer and invest up to 1\u00a0billion euros (US$1.38\u00a0billion) into the company, which it sees as \"platform for expansion into central and eastern Europe\". Labor representatives boycotted attending the OIAG supervisory board meeting for 12 hours criticizing lack of explicit job guarantees.[58]\n In July 2014, Slim invested in WellAware, a Texas-based oil and gas software developer, this investment was also made with former Republican vice president Dick Cheney. External funding was provided by Activant Capital Group and Slim, along with participation from strategic investors and WellAware board members Ed Whitacre. When Mexico eventually prepared to open its oil and gas sectors to domestic and foreign private capital for the first time in 75 years, it has been widely speculated that Slim will play a major role toward contributing to Mexico's new energy landscape. Slim's investment in WellAware, whose software allows oil and gas companies to track wells and pipelines remotely and collates data for making forecasts, adds to a number of oil-related investments that he has been making in the past years in Mexico, Latin America and the United States.[59]\n In January 2015, Grupo Carso publicly launched Claro Musica, an online music service that is a Latin American equivalent of iTunes and Spotify. Slim and his son increased their presence in Mexico's music industry, particularly in the retail music industry since 2013. Sanborn's, the Mexican retail department store chain owned by Slim contains an extensive music section and 170 locations in Mexico as well as controlling a majority stake in Mixup, Mexico's most successful retail music store that comprises a chain 117-store Mexican retailers along with an online iShop through a selling partnership with Apple. Mixup also generated more than US$320\u00a0million in revenue in 2014.[47]\n In March 2015, Slim began to set his sights on Spain, purchasing Spanish real estate at rock-bottom prices within the ailing Spanish economy. Slim has also been buying up stakes in various troubled Spanish corporations while eyeing various investments across Europe. Slim's investment company, Inmobiliaria Carso, announced it will buy a stake in the Spanish banking conglomerate Bankia, which couples with Slim's other purchase of Realia, a Spanish real estate company, where Slim is the second largest shareholder holding a 25% equity stake, behind Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas, a construction company where Slim is also a minor shareholder.[60][61]\n On April 15, 2015, Slim formed his own oil company called Carso Oil & Gas. The company was established after shareholders of the subsidiaries of Slim's business conglomerate, Grupo Carso, voted in February 2015 to merge Carso Infraestructura, Construccion y Perforacion and Condumex Perforaciones into Carso Oil & Gas. A report that was released by the new company listed its assets at 3.5\u00a0billion pesos (approximately US$230\u00a0million), placed within 17.7\u00a0million shares. Upon formation of the company, Slim remained sanguine about the company and Mexico's burgeoning energy sector where the state monopoly ceased to exist once held by state-owned oil company Pemex and opening the sector for private investors.[citation needed]\n On July 25, 2015, Slim's investment group Control Empresarial de Capitales invested in IMatchative, a technology startup that ranks the world's hedge funds creating in-depth behavioral profiles and business analytics. The company creates proprietary behavioral profiles of the top hedge fund managers using everything from divorce records to political donations incorporated in their profiles and fund analysis. Limited partners pay US$30,000 per subscription while hedge fund managers pay half the price and also sign up for a free version of the products the company offers.[62]\n On September 8, 2015, one of Slim's companies announced that Philosophy Jr. Studio, a fashion line for young women, will expand into a standalone retailer chain that will compete with elite fashion retailers across the globe.  Although the style of the new fashion line and the number of yearly collections has not been made public, Philosophy Jr. Studio is expected to compete with a myriad of well-known multinational fast fashion retailers such as H&M, Forever 21, Zara and C&A. The fashion line will be offered at individual brick and mortar boutiques at two shopping malls in Mexico City. With a US$20\u00a0million seed investment, Slim's plan is to have 100 standalone stores by 2017.[needs update] The brand was established in 2011 and has been sold at Sears Mexico, a unit of Grupo Sanborns, the restaurant, retail, and pharmacy chain owned by Slim.[63]\n Slim's father, Khalil Salim Haddad Aglamaz, was born on July 17, 1888[64] in Jezzine, Lebanon (then part of the Ottoman Empire). In 1902, at the age of 14, Haddad emigrated to Mexico alone, and later changed his name to Juli\u00e1n Slim Haddad.[11]\nIt was not uncommon for Lebanese children to be sent abroad before they reached the age of 15 to avoid being conscripted into the Ottoman Army, and four of Haddad's older brothers were already living in Mexico at the time of his arrival.[19]\n In 1911 Juli\u00e1n established a dry goods store, La Estrella de Oriente (The Star of the Orient). La Estrella de Oriente was an important dry goods store located on Venustiano Carranza where it had merchandise worth more than $100,000 by January 21, 1921, only ten years after the business was founded.[20] By 1921, he had begun investing in real estate in the flourishing commercial district of Mexico City where Juli\u00e1n would acquire prime real estate at fire sale prices and in Zocalo District during the 1910\u201317 Mexican Revolution.[5][9] By 1922, Juli\u00e1n's net worth reached $1,012,258 pesos and was diversified within various assets including real estate, businesses and various stocks.[20]\n In August 1926, Juli\u00e1n Slim married Linda Hel\u00fa Atta. Linda was born in Parral, Chihuahua, of Lebanese parents who had immigrated to Mexico in the late 19th century. Upon immigrating to Mexico, her parents had founded one of the first Arabic-language magazines for the Lebanese-Mexican community, using a printing press they had brought with them.[19]\nJulian and Linda had six children: Nour, Alma, Juli\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9, Carlos and Linda. Juli\u00e1n senior died in 1953, when Carlos was 13 years old.[19]\n Julian's business ventures became the source of considerable wealth for himself and his family.[19] As a result of financial prosperity of these ventures, Julian soon became a prominent and wealthy businessman, where he was able to make investments during bad economic cycles due to Mexico's frequent economic downturns.[25] Juli\u00e1n was known for his business savvy, strong work ethic, and commitment to traditional Lebanese moral values. Having a deep understanding of business that was considered ahead of his time, one of Juli\u00e1n's many pioneering business concepts was an efficient business as one that sold large volumes at smaller margins, and with payment facilities, factors that are prevalent in many large discount stores today.[20]\n In February 2011, Julian, the oldest brother of Carlos, died aged 74. He was a businessman, and worked in one of Mexico's top intelligence agencies.[65][66]\n Carlos Slim was married to Soumaya Domit from 1967 until her death in 1999. Among her interests were various philanthropic projects, including the creation of a legal framework for organ donation.[19] Slim has six children: Carlos, Marco Antonio, Patrick, Soumaya, Vanessa, and Johanna. Slim's fortune has given rise to a family business empire and he often acquires shares on behalf of himself and his children. His three older sons serve in key positions in the companies controlled by Slim where most are involved in the day-to-day running of Slim's business empire.[2][7][15][67] Slim underwent heart surgery in 1999.[33] In high school, Slim's favorite subjects were history, cosmography, and mathematics.[15] Slim and his wife had a very happy marriage, and he indicated that he does not intend to remarry.[68]\n In his office, Slim does not keep a computer and instead prefers to keep all his financial data in hand-written notebooks.[15][9] Due to the vast size of his business empire, Slim often jokes that he cannot keep track of all the companies he manages.[6] Carlos Slim is a Maronite Catholic,[69][70] and he is one of the prominent backers of Legion of Christ, a Roman Catholic religious institute.[71][72]\n On January 25, 2021, it was reported that Slim had contracted COVID-19.[73]\n On March 29, 2007, Slim surpassed American investor Warren Buffett as the world's second richest person with an estimated net worth of US$53.1\u00a0billion compared with Buffett's US$52.4\u00a0billion.[74]\n On August 4, 2007, The Wall Street Journal ran a cover story profiling Slim. The article said, \"While the market value of his stake in publicly traded companies could decline at any time, at the moment he is probably wealthier than Bill Gates\".[75] According to The Wall Street Journal, Slim credits part of his ability to \"discover investment opportunities\" early to the writings of his friend, futurist author Alvin Toffler.[75]\n On August 8, 2007, Fortune magazine reported that Slim had overtaken Gates as the world's richest person. Slim's estimated fortune soared to US$59\u00a0billion, based on the value of his public holdings at the end of July. Gates' net worth was estimated to be at least US$58\u00a0billion.[75][76]\n On March 5, 2008, Forbes ranked Slim as the world's second-richest person, behind Warren Buffett and ahead of Bill Gates.[4]\nOn March 11, 2009, Forbes ranked Slim as the world's third-richest person, behind Gates and Buffett and ahead of Larry Ellison.[4]\n On March 10, 2010, Forbes once again reported that Slim had overtaken Gates as the world's richest person, with a net worth of US$53.5\u00a0billion. At the time, Gates and Buffett had a net worth of US$53\u00a0billion and US$47\u00a0billion respectively.[4] He was the first Mexican to top the list.[77] It was the first time in 16 years that the person on top of the list was not from the United States.[78] It was also the first time the person at the top of the list was from an \"emerging economy\".[79] Between 2008 and 2010, Slim more than doubled his net worth from $35 to $75\u00a0billion.[7]\n In March 2011 Forbes stated that Slim had maintained his position as the wealthiest person in the world, with his fortune estimated at US$74\u00a0billion.[4]\n In December 2012, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa remained the world's richest person with an estimated net worth of US$75.5\u00a0billion.[80]\n On March 5, 2013, Forbes stated that Slim was still maintaining his first-place position as the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$73\u00a0billion.[4] On May 16, 2013, Bloomberg L.P. ranked Slim the second-richest person in the world, after Bill Gates.[81]\n On July 15, 2014, Forbes announced that Slim had reclaimed the position of the wealthiest person in the world, with a fortune of US$79.6\u00a0billion.[82]\n In September 2014, Forbes listed Slim as number 1 on its list of billionaires with a net worth of US$81.6\u00a0billion.[4]\n As of December 2016 his net worth was US$48.1 billion.[4]\n In 2017, his net worth was reported to be $54.5 billion.[83]\n In 2019, his net worth was said to be at least $58.1 billion, making him the richest man in Mexico. [84]\n In October 2020, his net worth was estimated at $53.7 billion.[85]\n Slim lives in a 6-bedroom home in the Lomas de Chapultepec district of Mexico City,[86] close to where he grew up, that has been his residence for over 40\u00a0years. Slim's real estate holding company Inmobiliaria Carso develops, invests, owns and operates many residential and commercial properties across Mexico. The company owns over 20 shopping centers, including ten in Mexico City, and operates stores in the country under U.S. brands including the Mexican arms of Saks Fifth Avenue, Sears and the Coffee Factory. Slim has been making private real estate investments around the world, particularly in the United States. He has been reported to have acquired 417 Fifth Avenue, an 11-story office tower for US$140\u00a0million and also a piece of the former New York Times building on West 43rd street. He controls approximately 8 acres of prime Beverly Hills real estate at the corner of Wilshire and Santa Monica Boulevards.[2]\n In May 2014, Slim opened Inbursa Aquarium, Latin America's largest aquarium.[6] Slim owns the Duke Seamans mansion, a 1901 beaux arts house on 5th Avenue in New York City, which he bought for $44 million in 2010. The mansion is 20,000 square feet and has 12 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, and a doctor's office in the basement.[2][87] In May 2015, he listed the property for sale at $80 million, nearly twice what he had paid.[28] In April 2015, Slim bought the Marquette Building in Detroit and purchased PepsiCo Americas Beverages headquarters in Somers, New York for US$87\u00a0million. Slim owns a second mansion in New York City at 10 W. 56th St, which he leased early in 2015 to the John Barrett Salon for US$1.5\u00a0million annually. The property was bought in 2011 for US$15.5\u00a0million.[28]\n Slim's growing fortune has been a subject of controversy, because it has been amassed in a developing country where average per capita income does not surpass US$14,500 a year, and nearly 17% of the population lives in poverty.[88] Critics claim that Slim is a monopolist, pointing to Telmex's control of 90% of the Mexican landline telephone market. Slim's wealth is the equivalent of roughly 5% of Mexico's annual economic output.[89] Telmex, of which 49.1% is owned by Slim and his family, charges among the highest usage fees in the world, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.[90] The average Mexican spends 1.50 pesos per day on Slim's goods and services for a total of roughly US$140\u00a0million a day and the Federal Telecommunications Institute, a new Mexican government anti-monopoly watchdog said in April 2014 that Slim's telecom businesses are monopolies.[6] Slim's business presence in Mexico alone is so broad that many Mexicans find it appropriate to call the country \"Slimlandia\" as it is almost impossible to go a day in Mexico without contributing to Slim's wealth.[7]\n According to Celso Garrido, economist at the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Slim's domination of Mexico's conglomerates prevents the growth of smaller companies, resulting in a shortage of paying jobs, forcing many Mexicans to seek better lives in the U.S.[91]\n In response to the criticism, Slim has stated, \"When you live for others' opinions, you are dead. I don't want to live thinking about how I'll be remembered [by Mexican people],\" claiming indifference about his position on Forbes list of the world's richest people. He has said he has no interest in becoming the world's richest person. When asked to explain his sudden increase in wealth at a press conference soon after Forbes annual rankings were published, he said, \"The stock market goes up\u00a0... and down\", and noted that his fortune could quickly drop.[89]\n Slim has been publicly skeptical of The Giving Pledge by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett giving away at least half of their fortunes. But\u2014according to his spokesman\u2014he devoted US$4\u00a0billion, or roughly 5%, to his Carlos Slim foundation as of 2011.[92] Though Slim has not gone as far as Gates and Buffett in pledging more than half of his fortune, Slim has expressed firm support for philanthropy and has advised budding entrepreneurs that businessmen must do more than give\u200d\u2014\u200cthey \"should participate in solving problems\".[9]  Slim has channeled his philanthropic endeavors into many initiatives such as funding a genomic medicine research project, subsidizing numerous arts and education projects in Mexico City, including the Museo Soumaya (named after his late wife), which displays his art collection for no admission fee.[9]\n Slim founded three nonprofit foundations concentrating on Mexico City: one for the arts, education, and health care; one for sports; and one for downtown restoration.\n Established in 1986 Fundaci\u00f3n Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa sponsors the Museo Soumaya in Mexico City, named after Slim's late wife, Soumaya Domit, opened 2011. It holds 66,000 pieces, including religious relics, contains the world's second-largest collection of Rodin sculptures, including The Kiss, the largest Salvador Dal\u00ed collection in Latin America, works by Leonardo da Vinci, Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and coins from the viceroys of Spain.[93] The inauguration in 2011 was attended by the President of Mexico, Nobel Prize laureates, writers and other celebrities.[94]\n After stating that he had donated US$4\u00a0billion of dividends to Fundaci\u00f3n Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa, US$2\u00a0billion in 2006, and another US$2\u00a0billion in 2010, Slim was ranked fifth in Forbes' World's Biggest Givers in May 2011.[92] Education and health care projects have included $100 million to perform 50,000 cataract surgeries in Peru through the Clinton Initiative, a US$20\u00a0million fund to strengthen small and medium-size businesses in Colombia, and a digital education program for youth in Mexico, US$150\u00a0million for programs in nutrition and disease prevention in Central America with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the government of Spain, US$50\u00a0million to work with the World Wildlife Fund on restoration of six areas for species in Mexico, including the monarch butterfly and US$100\u00a0million on education programs for young people through Colombian singer Shakira's Alas Foundation.[92]\n In 1995 Slim established Fundaci\u00f3n Telmex, a broad-ranging philanthropic foundation, which as he announced in 2007 had been provided with an asset base of US$4\u00a0billion to establish Carso Institutes for Health, Sports and Education. Furthermore, it was to work in support of an initiative of Bill Clinton to aid the people of Latin America.[19] Because Mexican foundations are not required to publish their financial information, it is not possible to confirm Slim's claims of charitable giving through a public source.[92] The foundation has organized Copa Telmex, an amateur sports tournament, recognized in 2007 and 2008 by Guinness World Records as having the most participants of any such tournament in the world. Together with Fundaci\u00f3n Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa, Telmex announced in 2008 that it was to invest more than US$250\u00a0million in Mexican sports programs, from grass-roots level to Olympic standard.[19] Telmex sponsored the Sauber F1 team for the 2011 season.[95]\n[96] Telmex donated at least $1 million to the Clinton Foundation.[97]\n In 2000, Slim and ex-broadcaster Jacobo Zabludowsky organized the Fundaci\u00f3n del Centro Hist\u00f3rico de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico A.C. (Mexico City Historic Center Foundation) to revitalize and rescue Mexico City's historic downtown area to enable more people to live, work and find entertainment there.[19] He has been Chair of the Council for the Restoration of the Historic Downtown of Mexico City since 2001.[98]\n In 2011, he, along with the president of Mexico, Mexico City mayor, and Mexico City archbishop, inaugurated the first phase of Plaza Mariana close to Basilica de Guadalupe.[99] The complex, whose construction was funded by Slim, includes an evangelization center, museum, columbarium, health center, and market.[100]\n \n ", "tags": ["1940 births", "Businesspeople from Mexico City", "Businesspeople in metals", "Mexican mining businesspeople", "Living people", "Mexican billionaires", "Mexican businesspeople in retailing", "Mexican businesspeople in the oil industry", "Mexican chief executives", "Mexican company founders", "Mexican Eastern Catholics", "Mexican expatriates in the United States", "Mexican football chairmen and investors", "Mexican investors", "Mexican Maronites", "Mexican mass media owners", "Mexican people of Lebanese descent", "Mexican philanthropists", "Mexican stock traders", "Mexican telecommunications industry businesspeople", "Mexican venture capitalists", "National Autonomous University of Mexico alumni", "Recipients of the National Order of the Cedar", "Samsung people", "Slim family", "The New York Times people", "Pages with non-numeric formatnum arguments", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "All articles lacking reliable references", "Articles lacking reliable references from April 2011", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from June 2016", "CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)", "CS1 maint: location", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia pending changes protected pages", "Use mdy dates from November 2020", "Articles containing potentially dated statements from April 2021", "All articles containing potentially dated statements", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles that are excessively detailed from November 2020", "All articles that are excessively detailed", "Wikipedia articles with style issues from November 2020", "All articles with style issues", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from October 2020", "Wikipedia articles in need of updating from November 2020", "All Wikipedia articles in need of updating", "Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch", "Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata", "Pages using Sister project links with default search", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Mexican business magnate, investor, and philanthropist\nFor his son, see Carlos Slim Domit.\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Slim and the second or maternal family name is  Hel\u00fa.\n\n\nCarlos Slim Hel\u00faSlim in December 2018Born (1940-01-28) January 28, 1940 (age\u00a081)Mexico City, MexicoNationalityMexicanEducationCivil engineeringAlma\u00a0materUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xicoKnown\u00a0for\nCEO of Telmex, Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, and Grupo Carso\nWorld's richest person, 2010\u201313\nNet\u00a0worthUS$ 53.1 billion (As of 1\u00a0April\u00a02021[update])[1]Spouse(s)Soumaya Domit (m. 1967\u20131999;

He eventually saved every financial and business transaction he made into a personal ledger book, which he still keeps.[16]\nAt the age of 12, he made his first stock purchase, of shares in a Mexican bank.[17] By the age of 15, Slim had become a shareholder in Mexico's largest bank.[9] At the age of 17, he earned 200 pesos a week working for his father's company.[18] He went on to study civil engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he also concurrently taught algebra and linear programming.[19][20][21]\nThough Slim was a civil engineering major, he also displayed an interest in economics. He took economics courses in Chile once he finished his engineering degree.[14] Graduating as a civil engineering major, Slim has stated that his mathematical ability and his background of linear programming was a key factor in helping him gain an edge in the business world, especially when reading financial statements.[15][22][23]\n\nBusiness career[edit]\n1960s[edit]\nAfter graduating from college in 1961, Slim began his career as a stock trader in Mexico, often working 14-hour days.[5] In 1965, profits from Slim's private investments reached US$400,000,[24] allowing him to start the stock brokerage Inversora Burs\u00e1til.[21] In addition, he also began laying the financial groundwork for Grupo Carso.[25] In 1965 he also bought Jarritos del Sur. In 1966, worth US$40\u00a0million,[24][26] he founded Inmobiliaria Carso.\n\n1970s[edit]\nCompanies in the construction, soft drink, printing, real estate, bottling and mining industries were the focus of Slim's early burgeoning business career.[9]  He later expanded into numerous industries including auto parts, aluminium, airlines, chemicals, tobacco, manufacturing of cables and wires, paper and packaging, copper and mineral extraction, tires, cement, retail, hotels, beverage distributors, telecommunications and financial services where Slim's Grupo Financiero Inbursa \u2013 which sells insurance and invests the savings, mutual funds and pension plans of millions of ordinary Mexicans.[25][27]  By 1972, he had established or acquired a further seven businesses in these categories, including one which rented construction equipment. In 1976, he branched out by acquiring a 60 percent share of Galas de M\u00e9xico, a small printer of cigarette-pack labels for US$1\u00a0million, and in 1980, he consolidated his business interests by forming Grupo Galas as the parent company of a conglomerate that had interests in industry, construction, mining, retail, food, and tobacco.[19] In 1981, Slim acquired a majority stake in Cigarros la Tabacelera Mexicana (Cigatam), Mexico's second largest producer and marketer of cigarettes, at a reduced price.[5]\n\n1980s[edit]\nIn 1982, the Mexican economy contracted rapidly. As many banks were struggling and foreign investors were cutting back on investing and scurrying, Slim began investing heavily and bought many flagship companies at depressed valuations.[5] Buying troubled assets at depressed prices to resell them later at an attractive price is a business strategy that Slim has executed throughout his career.[9][28]\nHaving a keen investment eye for value, Slim adhered to his value investment practices with a long history of buying stakes in companies he sees as undervalued.[29] Much of Slim's business dealings involved a simple strategy, which is to buy a business and hang on to it for its cash flow or eventually sell the stake at a greater profit in future, thereby netting the capital gains as well as reinvesting the initial principal into a new business.[30] In addition, his conglomerate structure allows Slim to purchase numerous stakes that it is made nearly recession proof if one or more sectors of the economy do not do well. \nFrom the mid 1960s to the early 1980s, Slim and his growing family lived a modest life, while earnings from Slim's many businesses were re-invested in expansion and more acquisitions. Slim acquired companies with strong returns on capital he believed were undervalued and overhauled their management. He diversified methodically in numerous industry sectors across the Mexican economy, investing in real estate, then a construction equipment company, and mining companies. The portfolio of Slim companies grew to include a printing company, a tobacco company and retail stores.[21]\nDuring the Mexican economic downturn before its recovery in 1985, Slim invested heavily. He bought all or a large percentage of numerous Mexican businesses, including Empresas Frisco, a mining and chemicals company producing silver, gold, copper, lead, and zinc from extracted ores, and also chemical products such as hydrofluoric acid and molybdenum for only $50 million, Industrias Nacobre, a manufacturer of copper products, Reynolds Aluminio, Compania Hulera Euzkadi, Mexico's largest tire maker, Bimex hotels, and majority share of Sanborn Hermanos food retailer, gift shop and restaurant chain. Slim spent US$13\u00a0million to buy insurance company Seguros de M\u00e9xico in 1984, and later absorbed the company into the firm, Seguros Inbursa.[21] The value of his stake in Seguros eventually became worth US$1.5\u00a0billion by 2007, after four spinoffs.[31] He also acquired a 40% and 50% interest in the Mexican arms of British American Tobacco and The Hershey Company, respectively as well as acquiring large blocks of Denny's and Firestone Tires. He moved into financial services as well, buying Seguros de M\u00e9xico and creating from it, along with other purchases such as Fianzas La Guardiana and Casa de Bolsa Inbursa, the Grupo Financiero Inbursa. Many of these acquisitions were financed by the revenues and cash flows from Cigatam, a tobacco business which he bought early in the economic downturn.[17][19]\nIn 1988, Slim bought the Nacobre group of companies, which trades in copper and aluminum products, along with a chemicals business, Qu\u00edmica Fluor, and others.[19]\n\n1990s[edit]\nSlim made a large fortune in the early 1990s when Mexico privatized its telecom industry and Grupo Carso acquired Telmex from the Mexican government.[9] In 1990 the Grupo Carso was floated as a public company initially in Mexico and then worldwide.[19] Grupo Carso also acquired majority ownership of Porcelanite, a tile making company in 1990. This investment was assigned to an associated company, but in 1995 Grupo Carso began growing its equity stake to 83 percent and subsequently made it a subsidiary.[17]\nLater in 1990, Slim acted in concert with France T\u00e9l\u00e9com and Southwestern Bell Corporation in order to buy the landline telephone company Telmex from the Mexican government, when Mexico began privatizing its national industries.[19] Slim was one of the initial investors of Telmex, the revenues of the company eventually formed the bulk of Slim's wealth.[30][32] By 2006, 90 percent of the telephone lines in Mexico were operated by Telmex, and his mobile telephone company, Telcel, which was created out of the Radiom\u00f3vil Dipsa company,[19] operated almost 80 percent of all the country's cellphones.[33] By 2012, Am\u00e9rica Movil, Slim's mobile telephone company, had taken over Telmex and made it into a privately held subsidiary.[30]\nIn 1991, he acquired Hoteles Calinda (now OSTAR Grupo Hotelero), and in 1993, he increased his stakes in General Tire and Grupo Aluminio to the point where he had a majority interest.[19]\nIn 1996, Grupo Carso was split into three companies: Carso Global Telecom, Grupo Carso, and Invercorporaci\u00f3n. In the following year, Slim bought the Mexican arm of Sears Roebuck.[19] In July 1997 Grupo Carso agreed in principle to sell Procter & Gamble de M\u00e9xico, a subsidiary of The Procter & Gamble Co., a manufacturing plant in Apizaco and the company's Lypps, Pampys, and other toilet-tissue brands for about US$170\u00a0million but kept its tissue-products company F\u00e1bricas de Papel Loreto y Pe\u00f1a Pobre.[17]\nIn 1999, Slim began expanding his business interests beyond Latin America. Though the bulk of his holdings still remained in Mexico, he began setting his sights towards the United States for overseas investments.\n\n2000s[edit]\nSlim became a prominent figure within the American business scene by 2003 when he began purchasing large stakes in a number of major US retailers such as Barnes & Noble, OfficeMax, Office Depot, Circuit City, Borders, and CompUSA.[34] Much of the reason behind Slim's international expansion was due to a running joke in the Mexican business scene where \"there was nothing left to acquire in Mexico\".[34]  He eyed towards investing the United States where he set up Telmex USA and also acquired a stake in Tracfone, a US cellular telephone company. At the same time, he established Carso Infraestructura y Construcci\u00f3n, S. A. (CICSA) as a construction and engineering company within Grupo Carso.[19] During the same year, Slim had heart surgery and subsequently passed on much of the day-to-day involvement in the businesses to his children and their spouses.[33]\nAm\u00e9rica Telecom, the holding company for Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, was incorporated in 2000. It took stakes in cellular telephone companies outside of Mexico, including the Brazilian ATL and Telecom Americas concerns, Techtel in Argentina, and others in Guatemala and Ecuador. In subsequent years, there were investment in Latin America, with companies in Colombia, Nicaragua, Peru, Chile, Honduras, and El Salvador, as well as a venture with Microsoft.\nIn 2005 Slim invested in Volaris, a Mexican airline[19] and established Impulsora del Desarrollo y el Empleo en Am\u00e9rica Latina SAB de CV (using the acronym \"IDEAL\"\u2014roughly translated as \"Promoter of Development and Employment in Latin America\"), a Mexican construction and civil engineering company primarily engaged in not-for-profit infrastructure development.  Since 2006,  IDEAL won three infrastructure contracts yet it faces stiff competition from a number of other Mexican and Spanish construction companies. The number of contracts is fewer than its biggest local competitor, Empresas ICA. During the same period, Empresas obtained 18 Mexican projects valued at US$1.09\u00a0billion, including airports, toll roads, hospitals and oil platforms. Some of the projects IDEAL has been awarded include the Nezahualcoyotl development, which is a landfill that was acquired for US$150\u00a0million by Slim to develop a shopping mall, two schools, a hospital and a park on the site. Other contracts IDEAL has been awarded include a water-treatment plant contract, and a real estate partnership with the Mexican hospital chain Star M\u00e9dica. IDEAL is also betting on one of the poorest landfills surrounding Mexico City. Slim has also planned to purchase several toll roads offered by the Mexican government that it took over from private companies following the December 1994 currency devaluation.[35] Though speculation that the landfill will take about 12 years to yield a return, the development of a such poor area is revealed to promise handsome business profits over the years as Grupo Elektra, Mexico's largest consumer electronics retailer, sells 2,000 flat screen televisions a year at its store in the area, making it the third-best-selling outlet. Included in the development, IDEAL will also collect rent from a university, a hospital and a school that will be built around a mall, will have 178 stores, including Inditex's Zara fashion chain and Slim's Grupo Sanborns and the Mexican unit of Sears Holdings. A park in Nezahualcoyotl, the first of its kind will also be constructed. The park will comprise 34 soccer fields, 12 tennis, basketball and volleyball courts, a baseball field and a gym with a swimming pool.[7][35]\n\n Arriving to the Presidential Palace for a meeting with Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on October 24, 2007\nIn 2007, after having amassed a 50.1% stake in the Cigatam tobacco company, Slim reduced his holdings by selling a large portion of his equity to Philip Morris for US$1.1\u00a0billion, while in the same year also selling his entire interest in a tile company, Porcelanite, for US$800\u00a0million. He licensed the Saks name and opened the Mexican arm of Saks Fifth Avenue in Santa Fe, Mexico. During the same year, the estimated value of all of Slim's companies was at US$150\u00a0billion.[21] On December 8, 2007, Grupo Carso announced that the remaining 103 CompUSA stores would be either liquidated or sold, bringing an end to the struggling company,[36] although the IT tech part of CompUSA continued under the name Telvista with U.S. locations in Dallas, Texas (U.S. Corporate Office) and Danville, Virginia. Telvista has five centers in Mexico (three in Tijuana, one center in Mexicali, and one in M\u00e9xico City).[37] After 28 years, Slim became the Honorary Lifetime Chairman of the business.\nIn 2008 Slim took a 6.4% stake valued at $27 million in the troubled New York Times Company, as the global recession and declining advertising revenues took a particularly heavy toll on print-based \"old media\" companies across the United States.[19] Slim increased his stake to 8% by 2012.[38] Slim's stake in the Times increased again to 16.8% of the company's Class A shares on January 20, 2015 when he exercised stock options to purchase 15.9 million shares, making him the largest shareholder in the company.[39][40] The New York Times Company's Class A shares are available for purchase by the public and offer less control over the company than Class B shares, which are privately held.[39] According to the company's 2016 annual filings, Slim owned 17.4% of the company's Class A shares, and none of the company's Class B shares.[41]\nSlim built Plaza Carso in Mexico City, where most of his ventures share a common headquarters address.[42]\n\n2010s[edit]\nThis section may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience.

The games are also broadcast on the Internet through UNO TV, offered by Telmex. Slim has been involved with broadcasting sports outside Mexico to larger markets such as the United States. In March 2012, Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil acquired the broadcast rights for the Olympic Games in Sochi 2014 and the Brazil 2016 for Latin America.[43]\nIn March 2012, Slim, along with American television host Larry King, established Ora TV, an on-demand digital television network that produces and distributes television shows including Larry King Now, Politicking with Larry King, Recessionista, and Jesse Ventura Uncensored.[44]\nIn September 2012, Slim bought 30% stakes in Pachuca and Le\u00f3n, two Mexican soccer teams through his telecommunications company America Movil. In December 2012, he bought all the shares of the second division team Estudiantes Tecos.[45] Slim has also completed business deals for the television rights to games of the Leon soccer team. His company America Movil purchased 30 percent of the team along with transmission rights as Slim doesn't have the rights to transmit content by broadcast television or cable TV as well as putting him in competition with Televisa and TV Azteca, two television companies with rights to the rest of Mexican soccer's first division.[46]\nIn 2013, Slim's company, Grupo Carso opened Mexico City's Telcel Theater, which operates in conjunction with his entertainment company, Grupo CIE (Corporaci\u00f3n Interamericana de Entretenimiento), Mexico's equivalent of Live Nation.[47]\nIn April 2013, Slim entered the business of managing Mexican prisons to expand the investments of his construction-finance company. Ideal acquired stakes in two federal prisons from Desarrolladora Homex SAB, a Mexican homebuilder where Slim's companies are to receive 4 billion pesos (US$326\u00a0million) within the agreement. The company run by his son, Marco Antonio Slim, added the prisons to its portfolio of infrastructure assets among which include toll roads, hydroelectric dams, and water-treatment plants.[48]\nIn July 2013, Slim's company America Movill invested US$40\u00a0million in Shazam, a British commercial mobile phone-based music identification service for an undisclosed share of ownership. America Movil partnered with the company to aid its growth into advertising and television and help the audio recognition service expand in Latin America.[49][50]\nIn November 2013, Slim invested US$60 million in the Israeli startup Mobli, a company that deals with connections between people and communities corralled according to different interests.\nIn December 2013, Slim's private equity fund, Sinca Inbursa, sold its stake in Mexican pharmaceutical company Landsteiner Scientific. Slim had acquired a 27.51 stake in the company in June 2008, which represented 6.6 percent of Sinca's investment portfolio. The private equity fund's investments are mainly in transportation and infrastructure and the fund had a total market cap of 5.152 billion pesos at the end of 2012.[51]\nSlim was criticized by the Dutch minister of economic affairs, Henk Kamp, in 2013 for attempting to expand his telecom empire beyond the Americas by Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil's buy-out offer to KPN, a Dutch landline and mobile telecommunications company privatized in the 1990s, by stating \"an acquisition of KPN by a 'foreign company' could have consequences for the Netherlands' national security\".[52] Two years after Slim's failed bid to take over the company mainly due to political intervention and Slim's paucity of interest in purchasing the company, Slim's America Movil SAB began offering 2.25\u00a0billion euros of bonds that can be converted into shares of Royal KPN NV. America Movil now controls a 21.1 percent stake of KPN with a market value of 3.1\u00a0billion euros as of May 20, 2015. Slim has been slowly decreasing his holdings since he was forced to withdraw a 7.2-billion-euro bid for the Dutch phone line carrier in 2013 after negotiations broke down and KPN's preference share foundation blocked the takeover attempt.[53]\nSlim has also set his sights within the energy industry as well. In 2011, Slim began buying a 70 percent stake in Geoprocesados SA's Tabasco Oil Co., gaining access to the Colombian oil market as the country seeks to boost crude and natural-gas output.[54] Slim began seeking to boost his oil investments in Colombia because of the country's open policies on exploration as well as furthering its commitment to double output by 2020.[55] Investors have also been drawn to Colombia because of improved security as well as a clear government regulatory framework for oil drilling.[56] In 2013, Mexico's national oil and gas company Pemex hired an offshore drilling rig from the Carso Group. Under the agreement, Pemex will operate the rig on a seven-year contract and will pay US$415\u00a0million. The rig is owned by Operadora Cicsa, a subsidiary of Carso Group.[57] The relationship between Pemex and Slim rans back as early as in 2006, where NOC hired CICSA for the drilling and completion of over 60 wells in the southern region\u200d\u2014\u200ccovering the Cinco Presidentes, Macuspana-Muspac, Samaria-Luna and Bellota-Jujo assets \u2013 and for the expansion of a petrochemical plant in Veracruz. Carso's infrastructure and construction subsidiary has been awarded with several oil well development contracts in Pemex's main assets\u200d\u2014\u200cincluding Chicontepec\u200d\u2014\u200cas well as tenders for the construction of natural gas pipelines and marine platforms. With the 2008 Pemex Law reform, the creation of integrated service contracts and the perspectives for a future energy reform, Slim has begun seizing business and investment opportunities in Mexico's oil and gas industry.  CICSA's pipe manufacturing division Swepomex into a marine platform provider. CICSA has also acquired majority shares in Oklahoma contractor Bronco Drilling, along with minority participations in Houston drilling company Allis Chalmers Energy. Slim controls a 15 percent stake in Bronco, with warrants that could boost the stake to 20 percent. He also has a 2.9 percent stake in Allis-Chalmers.[56] 15% of the country's main gas operator, Gas Natural Mexico now belong to Sinca Inbursa, a private equity fund controlled by Slim.[51] Slim Hel\u00fa has also maintained an important business presence in Spanish oil company Repsol and its Argentinian subsidiary YPF, Argentina's largest oil company, where Slim has an 8.4 percent stake.[3][29]\nOn April 23, 2014, Slim took control of Telekom Austria, Austria's biggest phone carrier, which has telcos in countries such as Bulgaria, Croatia and Belarus, under a 10-year agreement, was Slim's first successful business acquisition in Europe. In a syndicate holding structure the Austrian state holding company OIAG's 28 percent are combined with Slim's 27 percent ownership. America Movil will spend as much as US$2\u00a0billion to buy out minority shareholders in a mandatory public offer and invest up to 1\u00a0billion euros (US$1.38\u00a0billion) into the company, which it sees as \"platform for expansion into central and eastern Europe\". Labor representatives boycotted attending the OIAG supervisory board meeting for 12 hours criticizing lack of explicit job guarantees.[58]\nIn July 2014, Slim invested in WellAware, a Texas-based oil and gas software developer, this investment was also made with former Republican vice president Dick Cheney. External funding was provided by Activant Capital Group and Slim, along with participation from strategic investors and WellAware board members Ed Whitacre. When Mexico eventually prepared to open its oil and gas sectors to domestic and foreign private capital for the first time in 75 years, it has been widely speculated that Slim will play a major role toward contributing to Mexico's new energy landscape. Slim's investment in WellAware, whose software allows oil and gas companies to track wells and pipelines remotely and collates data for making forecasts, adds to a number of oil-related investments that he has been making in the past years in Mexico, Latin America and the United States.[59]\nIn January 2015, Grupo Carso publicly launched Claro Musica, an online music service that is a Latin American equivalent of iTunes and Spotify. Slim and his son increased their presence in Mexico's music industry, particularly in the retail music industry since 2013. Sanborn's, the Mexican retail department store chain owned by Slim contains an extensive music section and 170 locations in Mexico as well as controlling a majority stake in Mixup, Mexico's most successful retail music store that comprises a chain 117-store Mexican retailers along with an online iShop through a selling partnership with Apple. Mixup also generated more than US$320\u00a0million in revenue in 2014.[47]\nIn March 2015, Slim began to set his sights on Spain, purchasing Spanish real estate at rock-bottom prices within the ailing Spanish economy. Slim has also been buying up stakes in various troubled Spanish corporations while eyeing various investments across Europe. Slim's investment company, Inmobiliaria Carso, announced it will buy a stake in the Spanish banking conglomerate Bankia, which couples with Slim's other purchase of Realia, a Spanish real estate company, where Slim is the second largest shareholder holding a 25% equity stake, behind Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas, a construction company where Slim is also a minor shareholder.[60][61]\nOn April 15, 2015, Slim formed his own oil company called Carso Oil & Gas. The company was established after shareholders of the subsidiaries of Slim's business conglomerate, Grupo Carso, voted in February 2015 to merge Carso Infraestructura, Construccion y Perforacion and Condumex Perforaciones into Carso Oil & Gas. A report that was released by the new company listed its assets at 3.5\u00a0billion pesos (approximately US$230\u00a0million), placed within 17.7\u00a0million shares. Upon formation of the company, Slim remained sanguine about the company and Mexico's burgeoning energy sector where the state monopoly ceased to exist once held by state-owned oil company Pemex and opening the sector for private investors.[citation needed]\nOn July 25, 2015, Slim's investment group Control Empresarial de Capitales invested in IMatchative, a technology startup that ranks the world's hedge funds creating in-depth behavioral profiles and business analytics. The company creates proprietary behavioral profiles of the top hedge fund managers using everything from divorce records to political donations incorporated in their profiles and fund analysis. Limited partners pay US$30,000 per subscription while hedge fund managers pay half the price and also sign up for a free version of the products the company offers.[62]\nOn September 8, 2015, one of Slim's companies announced that Philosophy Jr. Studio, a fashion line for young women, will expand into a standalone retailer chain that will compete with elite fashion retailers across the globe.  Although the style of the new fashion line and the number of yearly collections has not been made public, Philosophy Jr. Studio is expected to compete with a myriad of well-known multinational fast fashion retailers such as H&M, Forever 21, Zara and C&A. The fashion line will be offered at individual brick and mortar boutiques at two shopping malls in Mexico City. With a US$20\u00a0million seed investment, Slim's plan is to have 100 standalone stores by 2017.[needs update] The brand was established in 2011 and has been sold at Sears Mexico, a unit of Grupo Sanborns, the restaurant, retail, and pharmacy chain owned by Slim.[63]\n\nFamily and personal life[edit]\nSlim's father, Khalil Salim Haddad Aglamaz, was born on July 17, 1888[64] in Jezzine, Lebanon (then part of the Ottoman Empire). In 1902, at the age of 14, Haddad emigrated to Mexico alone, and later changed his name to Juli\u00e1n Slim Haddad.[11]\nIt was not uncommon for Lebanese children to be sent abroad before they reached the age of 15 to avoid being conscripted into the Ottoman Army, and four of Haddad's older brothers were already living in Mexico at the time of his arrival.[19]\nIn 1911 Juli\u00e1n established a dry goods store, La Estrella de Oriente (The Star of the Orient). La Estrella de Oriente was an important dry goods store located on Venustiano Carranza where it had merchandise worth more than $100,000 by January 21, 1921, only ten years after the business was founded.[20] By 1921, he had begun investing in real estate in the flourishing commercial district of Mexico City where Juli\u00e1n would acquire prime real estate at fire sale prices and in Zocalo District during the 1910\u201317 Mexican Revolution.[5][9] By 1922, Juli\u00e1n's net worth reached $1,012,258 pesos and was diversified within various assets including real estate, businesses and various stocks.[20]\nIn August 1926, Juli\u00e1n Slim married Linda Hel\u00fa Atta. Linda was born in Parral, Chihuahua, of Lebanese parents who had immigrated to Mexico in the late 19th century. Upon immigrating to Mexico, her parents had founded one of the first Arabic-language magazines for the Lebanese-Mexican community, using a printing press they had brought with them.[19]\nJulian and Linda had six children: Nour, Alma, Juli\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9, Carlos and Linda. Juli\u00e1n senior died in 1953, when Carlos was 13 years old.[19]\nJulian's business ventures became the source of considerable wealth for himself and his family.[19] As a result of financial prosperity of these ventures, Julian soon became a prominent and wealthy businessman, where he was able to make investments during bad economic cycles due to Mexico's frequent economic downturns.[25] Juli\u00e1n was known for his business savvy, strong work ethic, and commitment to traditional Lebanese moral values. Having a deep understanding of business that was considered ahead of his time, one of Juli\u00e1n's many pioneering business concepts was an efficient business as one that sold large volumes at smaller margins, and with payment facilities, factors that are prevalent in many large discount stores today.[20]\nIn February 2011, Julian, the oldest brother of Carlos, died aged 74. He was a businessman, and worked in one of Mexico's top intelligence agencies.[65][66]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nCarlos Slim was married to Soumaya Domit from 1967 until her death in 1999. Among her interests were various philanthropic projects, including the creation of a legal framework for organ donation.[19] Slim has six children: Carlos, Marco Antonio, Patrick, Soumaya, Vanessa, and Johanna. Slim's fortune has given rise to a family business empire and he often acquires shares on behalf of himself and his children. His three older sons serve in key positions in the companies controlled by Slim where most are involved in the day-to-day running of Slim's business empire.[2][7][15][67] Slim underwent heart surgery in 1999.[33] In high school, Slim's favorite subjects were history, cosmography, and mathematics.[15] Slim and his wife had a very happy marriage, and he indicated that he does not intend to remarry.[68]\nIn his office, Slim does not keep a computer and instead prefers to keep all his financial data in hand-written notebooks.[15][9] Due to the vast size of his business empire, Slim often jokes that he cannot keep track of all the companies he manages.[6] Carlos Slim is a Maronite Catholic,[69][70] and he is one of the prominent backers of Legion of Christ, a Roman Catholic religious institute.[71][72]\nOn January 25, 2021, it was reported that Slim had contracted COVID-19.[73]\n\nPersonal fortune[edit]\nWealth[edit]\nOn March 29, 2007, Slim surpassed American investor Warren Buffett as the world's second richest person with an estimated net worth of US$53.1\u00a0billion compared with Buffett's US$52.4\u00a0billion.[74]\nOn August 4, 2007, The Wall Street Journal ran a cover story profiling Slim. The article said, \"While the market value of his stake in publicly traded companies could decline at any time, at the moment he is probably wealthier than Bill Gates\".[75] According to The Wall Street Journal, Slim credits part of his ability to \"discover investment opportunities\" early to the writings of his friend, futurist author Alvin Toffler.[75]\nOn August 8, 2007, Fortune magazine reported that Slim had overtaken Gates as the world's richest person. Slim's estimated fortune soared to US$59\u00a0billion, based on the value of his public holdings at the end of July. Gates' net worth was estimated to be at least US$58\u00a0billion.[75][76]\nOn March 5, 2008, Forbes ranked Slim as the world's second-richest person, behind Warren Buffett and ahead of Bill Gates.[4]\nOn March 11, 2009, Forbes ranked Slim as the world's third-richest person, behind Gates and Buffett and ahead of Larry Ellison.[4]\nOn March 10, 2010, Forbes once again reported that Slim had overtaken Gates as the world's richest person, with a net worth of US$53.5\u00a0billion. At the time, Gates and Buffett had a net worth of US$53\u00a0billion and US$47\u00a0billion respectively.[4] He was the first Mexican to top the list.[77] It was the first time in 16 years that the person on top of the list was not from the United States.[78] It was also the first time the person at the top of the list was from an \"emerging economy\".[79] Between 2008 and 2010, Slim more than doubled his net worth from $35 to $75\u00a0billion.[7]\nIn March 2011 Forbes stated that Slim had maintained his position as the wealthiest person in the world, with his fortune estimated at US$74\u00a0billion.[4]\nIn December 2012, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa remained the world's richest person with an estimated net worth of US$75.5\u00a0billion.[80]\nOn March 5, 2013, Forbes stated that Slim was still maintaining his first-place position as the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$73\u00a0billion.[4] On May 16, 2013, Bloomberg L.P. ranked Slim the second-richest person in the world, after Bill Gates.[81]\nOn July 15, 2014, Forbes announced that Slim had reclaimed the position of the wealthiest person in the world, with a fortune of US$79.6\u00a0billion.[82]\nIn September 2014, Forbes listed Slim as number 1 on its list of billionaires with a net worth of US$81.6\u00a0billion.[4]\nAs of December 2016 his net worth was US$48.1 billion.[4]\nIn 2017, his net worth was reported to be $54.5 billion.[83]\nIn 2019, his net worth was said to be at least $58.1 billion, making him the richest man in Mexico. [84]\nIn October 2020, his net worth was estimated at $53.7 billion.[85]\n\nReal estate[edit]\nSlim lives in a 6-bedroom home in the Lomas de Chapultepec district of Mexico City,[86] close to where he grew up, that has been his residence for over 40\u00a0years. Slim's real estate holding company Inmobiliaria Carso develops, invests, owns and operates many residential and commercial properties across Mexico. The company owns over 20 shopping centers, including ten in Mexico City, and operates stores in the country under U.S. brands including the Mexican arms of Saks Fifth Avenue, Sears and the Coffee Factory. Slim has been making private real estate investments around the world, particularly in the United States. He has been reported to have acquired 417 Fifth Avenue, an 11-story office tower for US$140\u00a0million and also a piece of the former New York Times building on West 43rd street. He controls approximately 8 acres of prime Beverly Hills real estate at the corner of Wilshire and Santa Monica Boulevards.[2]\nIn May 2014, Slim opened Inbursa Aquarium, Latin America's largest aquarium.[6] Slim owns the Duke Seamans mansion, a 1901 beaux arts house on 5th Avenue in New York City, which he bought for $44 million in 2010. The mansion is 20,000 square feet and has 12 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, and a doctor's office in the basement.[2][87] In May 2015, he listed the property for sale at $80 million, nearly twice what he had paid.[28] In April 2015, Slim bought the Marquette Building in Detroit and purchased PepsiCo Americas Beverages headquarters in Somers, New York for US$87\u00a0million. Slim owns a second mansion in New York City at 10 W. 56th St, which he leased early in 2015 to the John Barrett Salon for US$1.5\u00a0million annually. The property was bought in 2011 for US$15.5\u00a0million.[28]\n\nReactions[edit]\nSlim's growing fortune has been a subject of controversy, because it has been amassed in a developing country where average per capita income does not surpass US$14,500 a year, and nearly 17% of the population lives in poverty.[88] Critics claim that Slim is a monopolist, pointing to Telmex's control of 90% of the Mexican landline telephone market. Slim's wealth is the equivalent of roughly 5% of Mexico's annual economic output.[89] Telmex, of which 49.1% is owned by Slim and his family, charges among the highest usage fees in the world, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.[90] The average Mexican spends 1.50 pesos per day on Slim's goods and services for a total of roughly US$140\u00a0million a day and the Federal Telecommunications Institute, a new Mexican government anti-monopoly watchdog said in April 2014 that Slim's telecom businesses are monopolies.[6] Slim's business presence in Mexico alone is so broad that many Mexicans find it appropriate to call the country \"Slimlandia\" as it is almost impossible to go a day in Mexico without contributing to Slim's wealth.[7]\nAccording to Celso Garrido, economist at the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Slim's domination of Mexico's conglomerates prevents the growth of smaller companies, resulting in a shortage of paying jobs, forcing many Mexicans to seek better lives in the U.S.[91]\nIn response to the criticism, Slim has stated, \"When you live for others' opinions, you are dead. I don't want to live thinking about how I'll be remembered [by Mexican people],\" claiming indifference about his position on Forbes list of the world's richest people. He has said he has no interest in becoming the world's richest person. When asked to explain his sudden increase in wealth at a press conference soon after Forbes annual rankings were published, he said, \"The stock market goes up\u00a0... and down\", and noted that his fortune could quickly drop.[89]\n\nPhilanthropy[edit]\nSlim has been publicly skeptical of The Giving Pledge by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett giving away at least half of their fortunes. But\u2014according to his spokesman\u2014he devoted US$4\u00a0billion, or roughly 5%, to his Carlos Slim foundation as of 2011.[92] Though Slim has not gone as far as Gates and Buffett in pledging more than half of his fortune, Slim has expressed firm support for philanthropy and has advised budding entrepreneurs that businessmen must do more than give\u200d\u2014\u200cthey \"should participate in solving problems\".[9]  Slim has channeled his philanthropic endeavors into many initiatives such as funding a genomic medicine research project, subsidizing numerous arts and education projects in Mexico City, including the Museo Soumaya (named after his late wife), which displays his art collection for no admission fee.[9]\nSlim founded three nonprofit foundations concentrating on Mexico City: one for the arts, education, and health care; one for sports; and one for downtown restoration.\n\nFundaci\u00f3n Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa[edit]\nEstablished in 1986 Fundaci\u00f3n Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa sponsors the Museo Soumaya in Mexico City, named after Slim's late wife, Soumaya Domit, opened 2011. It holds 66,000 pieces, including religious relics, contains the world's second-largest collection of Rodin sculptures, including The Kiss, the largest Salvador Dal\u00ed collection in Latin America, works by Leonardo da Vinci, Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and coins from the viceroys of Spain.[93] The inauguration in 2011 was attended by the President of Mexico, Nobel Prize laureates, writers and other celebrities.[94]\nAfter stating that he had donated US$4\u00a0billion of dividends to Fundaci\u00f3n Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa, US$2\u00a0billion in 2006, and another US$2\u00a0billion in 2010, Slim was ranked fifth in Forbes' World's Biggest Givers in May 2011.[92] Education and health care projects have included $100 million to perform 50,000 cataract surgeries in Peru through the Clinton Initiative, a US$20\u00a0million fund to strengthen small and medium-size businesses in Colombia, and a digital education program for youth in Mexico, US$150\u00a0million for programs in nutrition and disease prevention in Central America with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the government of Spain, US$50\u00a0million to work with the World Wildlife Fund on restoration of six areas for species in Mexico, including the monarch butterfly and US$100\u00a0million on education programs for young people through Colombian singer Shakira's Alas Foundation.[92]\n\nFundaci\u00f3n Telmex[edit]\nIn 1995 Slim established Fundaci\u00f3n Telmex, a broad-ranging philanthropic foundation, which as he announced in 2007 had been provided with an asset base of US$4\u00a0billion to establish Carso Institutes for Health, Sports and Education. Furthermore, it was to work in support of an initiative of Bill Clinton to aid the people of Latin America.[19] Because Mexican foundations are not required to publish their financial information, it is not possible to confirm Slim's claims of charitable giving through a public source.[92] The foundation has organized Copa Telmex, an amateur sports tournament, recognized in 2007 and 2008 by Guinness World Records as having the most participants of any such tournament in the world. Together with Fundaci\u00f3n Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa, Telmex announced in 2008 that it was to invest more than US$250\u00a0million in Mexican sports programs, from grass-roots level to Olympic standard.[19] Telmex sponsored the Sauber F1 team for the 2011 season.[95]\n[96] Telmex donated at least $1 million to the Clinton Foundation.[97]\n\nFundaci\u00f3n del Centro Hist\u00f3rico de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico A.C.[edit]\nIn 2000, Slim and ex-broadcaster Jacobo Zabludowsky organized the Fundaci\u00f3n del Centro Hist\u00f3rico de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico A.C. (Mexico City Historic Center Foundation) to revitalize and rescue Mexico City's historic downtown area to enable more people to live, work and find entertainment there.[19] He has been Chair of the Council for the Restoration of the Historic Downtown of Mexico City since 2001.[98]\nIn 2011, he, along with the president of Mexico, Mexico City mayor, and Mexico City archbishop, inaugurated the first phase of Plaza Mariana close to Basilica de Guadalupe.[99] The complex, whose construction was funded by Slim, includes an evangelization center, museum, columbarium, health center, and market.[100]\n\nAwards[edit]\nEntrepreneurial Merit Medal of Honor in 1985 from Mexico's Chamber of Commerce.\nCommander in the Belgian Order of Leopold II\nGolden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1994[101]\nCEO of the year in 2003 by Latin Trade magazine\nCEO of the decade in 2004 by Latin Trade magazine\nFundacion Telmex received in 2007 the National Sports Prize of Mexico for sports promotion\nIn 2008 his philanthropy was recognized with the award of The National Order of the Cedar by the Lebanese government.[19]\nIn 2011 the Hispanic Society of America awarded Fundacion Carlos Slim the Sorolla Medal for its contribution to the arts and culture[102]\nOn May 20, 2012. Slim was awarded an honorary doctorate in public service from George Washington University.[103]\nOn March 21, 2020, he was awarded the Queen Sof\u00eda Spanish Institute Sophia Award for Excellence at an awards luncheon.[104]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"Bloomberg Billionaires Index: Carlos Slim\".
