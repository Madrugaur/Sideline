Zeilberger gave the first proof of the alternating sign matrix conjecture, noteworthy not only for its mathematical content, but also for the fact that Zeilberger recruited nearly a hundred volunteer checkers to \"pre-referee\" the paper. In 2011, together with Manuel Kauers and Christoph Koutschan, Zeilberger proved the q-TSPP conjecture, which was independently stated in 1983 by George Andrews and David P.

In 2004, Zeilberger was awarded the Euler Medal; the citation refers to him as \"a champion of using computers and algorithms to do mathematics quickly and efficiently\".[11] In 2016 he received, together with Manuel Kauers and Christoph Koutschan, the David P.
