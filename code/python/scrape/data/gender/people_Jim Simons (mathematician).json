{"name": "Jim Simons (mathematician)", "content": "\n James Harris Simons (/\u02c8sa\u026am\u0259nz/; born 25 April 1938) is an American mathematician, billionaire hedge fund manager, and philanthropist.[4] He is the founder of Renaissance Technologies, a quantitative hedge fund based in Setauket-East Setauket, New York. He and his fund are known to be quantitative investors, using mathematical models and algorithms to make investment gains from market inefficiencies. Due to the long-term aggregate investment returns of Renaissance and its Medallion Fund, Simons is described as the \"greatest investor on Wall Street,\" and more specifically \"the most successful hedge fund manager of all time.\"[5][6][7]\n As reported by Forbes, Simons' net worth is estimated to be $24.6 billion, making him the 23rd-richest person in the United States.[8]\n Simons is known for his studies on pattern recognition. He developed the Chern\u2013Simons form (with Shiing-Shen Chern), and contributed to the development of string theory by providing a theoretical framework to combine geometry and topology with quantum field theory.[9] In 1994, Simons founded the Simons Foundation with his wife to support researches in mathematics and fundamental sciences. He is one of the biggest donors to the University of California, Berkeley, establishing the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing in 2012, and to Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, where he serves as a member of the Board of Trustees.[10][11]\n In 2016, asteroid 6618 Jimsimons, discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1936, was named after Simons by the International Astronomical Union in honor of his contributions to mathematics and philanthropy.[12]\n James Harris Simons was born on April 25, 1938[13][14] to an American Jewish family,[15] the only child of Marcia (n\u00e9e Kantor)[16] and Matthew Simons, and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts.[17] His father owned a shoe factory, and his mother was a distant relative of Georg Cantor.[18]\n He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from MIT in 1958[19] and a PhD in mathematics, from the University of California, Berkeley, under supervision of Bertram Kostant in 1961, at the age of 23.[19]\n Simons' mathematical work has primarily focused on the geometry and topology of manifolds. His 1962 Berkeley PhD thesis, written under the direction of Bertram Kostant, gave a new proof of Berger's classification of the holonomy groups of Riemannian manifolds. He subsequently began to work with Shing-Shen Chern on the theory of characteristic classes, eventually discovering the Chern\u2013Simons secondary characteristic classes of 3-manifolds. Later, a mathematical physicist Albert Schwarz discovered early topological quantum field theory, which is an application of the Chern\u2013Simons form. \nIt is also related to the Yang-Mills functional on 4-manifolds, and has had an effect on modern physics. These and other contributions to geometry and topology led to Simons becoming the 1976 recipient of the AMS Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry.[20] In 2014, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences of the USA.[21]\n In 1964, Simons worked with the National Security Agency to break codes.[22] Between 1964 and 1968, he was on the research staff of the Communications Research Division of the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and taught mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, ultimately joining the faculty at Stony Brook University. From 1968 to 1978, he was appointed chairman of the math department at Stony Brook University.[23] Simons was asked by IBM in 1973 to attack the block cipher Lucifer, an early but direct precursor to the Data Encryption Standard (DES).[24] Simons founded Math for America, a nonprofit organization, in January 2004 with a mission to improve mathematics education in United States public schools by recruiting more highly qualified teachers.[25]\n For more than two decades, Simons' Renaissance Technologies' hedge funds, which trade in markets around the world, have employed mathematical models to analyze and execute trades, many automated. Renaissance uses computer-based models to predict price changes in financial instruments. These models are based on analyzing as much data as can be gathered, then looking for non-random movements to make predictions.\n Medallion, the main fund which is closed to outside investors, has earned over $100 billion in trading profits since its inception in 1988. This translates to a 66.1% gross return or a 39.1% average net return between 1988 - 2018.[28]  Renaissance Technologies manages three other funds - Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF), Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha (RIDA) and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Global Equity Fund - which, as of April 2019, totalled approximately $55 billion in combined assets and were open to outside investors.[28]\n Renaissance employs specialists with non-financial backgrounds, including mathematicians, physicists, signal processing experts and statisticians. The firm's latest fund is the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF).[29] RIEF has historically trailed the firm's better-known Medallion fund, a separate fund that contains only the personal money of the firm's executives.[30]\n \"It's startling to see such a highly successful mathematician achieve success in another field,\" says Edward Witten, professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey and considered by many of his peers to be the most accomplished theoretical physicist alive.[31] In 2006, Simons was named Financial Engineer of the Year by the International Association of Financial Engineers. In 2020, he was estimated to have personally earned $2.6 billion,[32] $2.8\u00a0billion in 2007,[33] $1.7\u00a0billion in 2006,[34] $1.5\u00a0billion in 2005[35] (the largest compensation among hedge fund managers that year),[36] and $670\u00a0million in 2004. On October 10, 2009, Simons announced he would retire on January 1, 2010 but remain at Renaissance as nonexecutive chairman.[37]\n Simons shuns the limelight and rarely gives interviews, citing Benjamin the Donkey in Animal Farm for explanation: \"'God gave me a tail to keep off the flies. But I'd rather have had no tail and no flies.'  That's kind of the way I feel about publicity.\"[38][39]\n In 1996, his son Paul, aged 34, was riding a bicycle, when he was killed by a car on Long Island.[22] In 2003, his son Nicholas, aged 24, drowned on a trip to Bali, Indonesia. His son Nat Simons is an investor and philanthropist.[40]\n Simons is a major contributor to Democratic Party political action committees. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Simons was ranked the #5 donor to federal candidates in the 2016 election cycle, coming behind Renaissance Technologies' co-CEO Robert Mercer, who ranked #1 and generally donates to Republicans.[41] Simons has donated $7\u00a0million to Hillary Clinton's Priorities USA Action,[42] $2.6\u00a0million to the House and Senate Majority PACs, and $500,000 to EMILY's List.[41] He also donated $25,000 to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham's super PAC.[41] Since 2006 Simons has contributed about $30.6\u00a0million to federal campaigns.[41] Since 1990, Renaissance Technologies has contributed $59,081,152 to federal campaigns and since 2001, has spent $3,730,000 on lobbying as of 2016.[43]\n In August 2020 Simons donated $1.5 million to the Senate Majority PAC, a democratic super-PAC. [44]\n According to The Wall Street Journal in May 2009, Simons was questioned by investors on the dramatic performance gap of Renaissance Technologies' portfolios. The Medallion Fund, which has been available exclusively to current and past employees and their families, surged 80% in 2008 in spite of hefty fees; the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF), owned by outsiders, lost money in both 2008 and 2009; RIEF declined 16% in 2008.[45]\n On July 22, 2014, Simons was subject to bipartisan condemnation by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations for the use of complex basket options to shield day-to-day trading (usually subject to higher ordinary income tax rates) as long-term capital gains. \"Renaissance Technologies was able to avoid paying more than $6 billion in taxes by disguising its day-to-day stock trades as long term investments,\" said Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), the committee's ranking Republican, in his opening statement.[46]\n An article published in The New York Times in 2015 said that Simons was involved in one of the biggest tax battles of the year, with Renaissance Technologies being \"under review by the I.R.S. over a loophole that saved their fund an estimated $6.8 billion in taxes over roughly a decade.\"[47]\n In 2014, Simons reportedly earned US$1.2 billion including a share of his firm's management and performance fees, cash compensation and stock and option awards.[48] According to Forbes magazine Simons had a net worth of $18\u00a0billion in 2017, making him #24 on the Forbes 400 richest people list.[49] In 2018, he was ranked 23rd by Forbes,[50] and in October 2019, his net worth was estimated to be $21.6\u00a0billion.[51] In March 2019, he was named one of the highest-earning hedge fund managers and traders by Forbes.[52]\n Simons owns a motor yacht, named Archimedes. It was built at the Dutch yacht builder Royal Van Lent and delivered to Simons in 2008.[53]\n In total, Simons has given over $2.7 billion to philanthropic causes.[54] Simons and his second wife, Marilyn Hawrys Simons, co-founded the Simons Foundation in 1994, a charitable organization that supports projects related to education and health, in addition to scientific research.[2] The Simons Foundation established the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) in 2003 as a scientific initiative within the Simons Foundation's suite of programs. SFARI's mission is to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders.[55]\n In 2004, Simons founded Math for America with an initial pledge of $25\u00a0million from the Simons Foundation, a pledge he later doubled in 2006.[56]\n Through the foundation, Simons has been a major benefactor of the University of California, Berkeley. On July 1, 2012, the Simons Foundation pledged $60 million to Berkeley to establish the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, the world's leading institute for collaborative research in theoretical computer science.[57] The foundation has also made other major gifts to Berkeley, notably to its Mathematical Sciences Research Institute.[58][59]\n The Simons Foundation established the Flatiron Institute in 2016, to house 5 groups of computational scientists (each with 60 or more PhD level researchers). The institute consists of four cores or departments: CCB (Center for Computational Biology), CCA (Center for Computational Astrophysics), CCQ (Center for Computational Quantum mechanics), CCM (Center for Computational Mathematics), and CCN (Center for Computational Neuroscience). The new institute is located in Manhattan and represents a major investment in basic computational science.\n Via the foundation, Simons and his wife funded the renovation of the building housing the mathematics department at MIT, which in 2016 was named after the two of them.[60]\n In memory of his son Paul, whom he had with his first wife, Barbara Simons, he established Avalon Park, a 130-acre (0.53\u00a0km2) nature preserve in Stony Brook. In 1996, 34-year-old Paul was killed by a car driver while riding a bicycle near the Simons home.\n Another son, Nick Simons, drowned at age 24 while on a trip to Bali in Indonesia in 2003. Nick had worked in Nepal. The Simons have become large donors to Nepalese healthcare through the Nick Simons Institute.[61][62]\n In 2006, Simons donated $25\u00a0million to Stony Brook University through the Stony Brook Foundation, the largest donation ever to a State University of New York school at the time.[63] On February 27, 2008, then Gov. Eliot Spitzer announced a $60\u00a0million donation by the Simons Foundation to found the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at Stony Brook, the largest gift to a public university in New York state history.[64]\n In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, George Soros, Jack Nash, Julian Roberston, Kenneth Griffin, Leon Levy, Louis Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Paul Tudor Jones, Seth Klarman and Steven A. Cohen.[65]\n He was named by the Financial Times in 2006 as \"the world's smartest billionaire\".[66] In 2011, he was included in the 50 Most Influential ranking of Bloomberg Markets Magazine.[67]\n A book about Simons and his investing methods, The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution by Gregory Zuckerman was released November 5, 2019.[68] In 2018, Trinity College Dublin awarded him with an honorary doctorate.[69]\n ", "tags": ["1938 births", "Living people", "20th-century American businesspeople", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American businesspeople", "21st-century American mathematicians", "21st-century philanthropists", "Academics of Lancaster University", "Activists from New York (state)", "American billionaires", "American chairpersons of corporations", "American chief executives of financial services companies", "American cryptographers", "American financial analysts", "American financial company founders", "American financiers", "American health activists", "American hedge fund managers", "American investors", "American money managers", "American political fundraisers", "American stock traders", "Autism activists", "Businesspeople from Massachusetts", "Businesspeople from New York City", "Differential geometers", "Giving Pledgers", "Harvard University faculty", "Jewish activists", "Jewish American philanthropists", "Jewish American scientists", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Science alumni", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty", "Mathematicians from Massachusetts", "Mathematicians from New York (state)", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "People associated with the Madoff investment scandal", "People from Long Island", "People from Manhattan", "People from Newton, Massachusetts", "Philanthropists from New York (state)", "Scientists from New York City", "Stock and commodity market managers", "Trustees of the Institute for Advanced Study", "University of California, Berkeley alumni", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from November 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from November 2015", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American Mathematician\nFor other people named James Simons, see James Simons (disambiguation).\n\n\nJim SimonsSimons in 2007Born (1938-04-25) April 25, 1938 (age\u00a082)Newton, Massachusetts, U.S.EducationUniversity of California, Berkeley\nMITOccupationmathematicianhedge fund managerphilanthropistKnown\u00a0for\nFounding and managing Renaissance Technologies\nCreating the Chern\u2013Simons form with Shiing-Shen Chern\nNet\u00a0worth US$24.6 Billion (February 2021)[1]Spouse(s)Barbara Bluestein\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01959; div.\u00a01974)\u200b Marilyn Hawrys Simons[2]Children5,[2] including Nat SimonsAwardsOswald Veblen Prize (1976)[3]\nJames Harris Simons (/\u02c8sa\u026am\u0259nz/; born 25 April 1938) is an American mathematician, billionaire hedge fund manager, and philanthropist.[4] He is the founder of Renaissance Technologies, a quantitative hedge fund based in Setauket-East Setauket, New York.
