While studying at Moscow State University, he became one of the first followers of the famous Luzin school. Khinchin graduated from the university in 1916 and six years later he became a full professor there, retaining that position until his death.\n Khinchin's early works focused on real analysis. Later he applied methods from the metric theory of functions to problems in probability theory and number theory. He became one of the founders of modern probability theory, discovering the law of the iterated logarithm in 1924, achieving important results in the field of limit theorems, giving a definition of a stationary process and laying a foundation for the theory of such processes.\n Khinchin made significant contributions to the metric theory of Diophantine approximations and established an important result for simple real continued fractions, discovering a property of such numbers that leads to what is now known as Khinchin's constant. He also published several important works on statistical physics, where he used the methods of probability theory, and on information theory, queuing theory and mathematical analysis.\n In 1939 Khinchin was elected as a Correspondent Member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He was awarded the Stalin Prize (1941), the Order of Lenin, three other orders, and medals.[citation needed]\n ", "tags": ["20th-century Russian mathematicians", "Soviet mathematicians", "Number theorists", "Probability theorists", "Queueing theorists", "Stalin Prize winners", "Moscow State University alumni", "Moscow State University faculty", "Corresponding Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "1894 births", "1959 deaths", "Burials at Donskoye Cemetery", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Articles containing French-language text", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from November 2018", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "In this Eastern Slavic name, the patronymic is  Yakovlevich and the family name is  Khinchin.\nAleksandr KhinchinAleksandr Ya.
