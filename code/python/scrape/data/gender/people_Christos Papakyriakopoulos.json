But he was enrolled as research student at Athens University, being awarded a Ph.D. in 1943 on the recommendation of Constantin Carath\u00e9odory. In 1948, he was invited by Ralph Fox to come as his guest at the Princeton University mathematics department because Fox had been impressed by a letter from Papakyriakopoulos that purported to prove Dehn's lemma. The proof, as it turned out, was faulty, but Fox's sponsorship would continue for many years and enabled Papakyriakopoulos to work on his mathematics without concern for financial support.\n Papakyriakopoulos is best known for his proofs of Dehn's lemma, the loop theorem, and the sphere theorem, three foundational results for the study of 3-manifolds. In honor of this work, he was awarded the first Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry in 1964. From the early 1960s on, he mostly worked on the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. Bernard Maskit produced counterexamples about his proof three times.[1]\n The following unusual limerick was composed by John Milnor,[2] shortly after learning of several graduate students' frustration at completing a project where the work of every Princeton mathematics faculty member was to be summarized in a limerick:\n This may be the only limerick where one word spans three lines. The phrase \"without any strain\" is not meant to indicate that Papa did not expend much energy in his efforts. Rather, it refers to Papa's \"tower construction\", which quite nicely circumvents much of the difficulty in the cut-and-paste efforts that preceded Papa's proof.\n Papakyriakopoulos sympathized with leftist politics[3] and in 1941 joined the student branch of the National Liberation Front (EAM). When he went to live in the US, in 1948 the Greek authorities reported him to the American authorities as a \"dangerous communist\"[3] and asked for his extradition, but Princeton Institute of Advanced Study gave him protection as it had done with others suffering political persecution.[4]\n He was a reclusive character, spending most of his time in his office listening to his beloved Richard Wagner.[3] Legend has it that in the United States he lived for 25 years in the same hotel room he used when he first arrived in the country, all of his belongings inside his original luggage.[3]\n Papakyriakopoulos died of stomach cancer at age 62 in Princeton, New Jersey.[3][5]\n ", "tags": ["1914 births", "1976 deaths", "Greek mathematicians", "20th-century mathematicians", "Topologists", "Princeton University faculty", "Deaths from stomach cancer", "Deaths from cancer in New Jersey", "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens alumni", "People from Athens", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "CS1 Greek-language sources (el)", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Greek mathematician\nChristos Dimitriou Papakyriakopoulos (/\u02ccp\u00e6p\u0259k\u026a\u0259ri\u0259\u02c8k\u0252p\u0259l\u0252s/), commonly known as Papa (Greek: \u03a7\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 [papakir\u029da\u02c8kopulos]; June 29, 1914 \u2013 June 29, 1976), was a Greek mathematician specializing in geometric topology.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Tribute\n4 Other activities\n5 Death\n6 See also\n7 Notes\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nPapakyriakopoulos was born in Chalandri, then in the Municipality of Athens, now in North Athens.\n\nCareer[edit]\nPapakyriakopoulos worked in isolation at Athens Polytechnic as research assistant to Professor Nikolaos Kritikos.
