{"name": "Hellmuth Kneser", "content": "Hellmuth Kneser (16 April 1898 \u2013 23 August 1973) was a Baltic German mathematician, who made notable contributions to group theory and topology.  His most famous result may be his theorem on the existence of a prime decomposition for 3-manifolds.  His proof originated the concept of normal surface, a fundamental cornerstone of the theory of 3-manifolds.\n He was born in Dorpat, Russian Empire (now Tartu, Estonia) and died in T\u00fcbingen, Germany.  He was the son of the mathematician Adolf Kneser and the father of the mathematician Martin Kneser.  He assisted Wilhelm S\u00fcss in the founding of the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach and served as the director of the institute from 1958  to 1959.\nHe was an editor of Mathematische Zeitschrift, Archiv der Mathematik and Aequationes Mathematicae. \n Kneser formulated the problem of non-integer iteration of functions and proved the existence of the entire Abel function of the exponential; on the base of this Abel function, he constructed the functional square root of the exponential function as a half-iteration of the exponential, i.e. a function \u03c6 such that \u03c6(\u03c6(z)) = exp(z).[1]\n Kneser was a student of David Hilbert.
