{"name": "James Hoban", "content": "James Hoban  (1758[1] \u2013 December 8, 1831) was an Irish architect, best known for designing the White House in Washington, D.C.\n James Hoban was a Roman Catholic raised on an estate belonging to the Earl of Desart in Callan, County Kilkenny, Ireland. He worked there as a wheelwright and carpenter until his early twenties, when he was given an 'advanced student' place in the Dublin Society's Drawing School on Lower Grafton Street. He studied under Thomas Ivory.[2] He excelled in his studies and received the prestigious Duke of Leinster's medal for drawings of \"Brackets, Stairs, and Roofs\" from the Dublin Society in 1780. Hoban was an apprentice to Ivory, from 1779 to 1785.\n Following the American Revolutionary War, Hoban emigrated to the United States, and established himself as an architect in Philadelphia in 1785.[3]\n Hoban was in South Carolina by April 1787, where he designed numerous buildings including the Charleston County Courthouse (1790\u201392), built on the ruins of the former South Carolina Statehouse (1753, burned 1788).[4] President George Washington admired Hoban's work on his Southern Tour, Washington may have met with him in Charleston in May 1791, and summoned the architect to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the temporary national capital) in June 1792.[5]\n In July 1792, Hoban was named winner of the design competition for the White House.[6] His initial design seems to have had a 3-story facade, nine bays across (like the Charleston courthouse). Under Washington's influence, Hoban amended this to a 2-story facade, 11 bays across, and, at Washington's insistence, the whole presidential mansion was faced with stone. It is unclear whether any of Hoban's surviving drawings are actually from the competition.[7]\n It is known that Hoban owned at least three slaves who were employed as carpenters in the construction of the White House.  Their names are recorded as \"Ben, Daniel, and Peter\" and appear in a James Hoban slave payroll.[8]\n Hoban was also one of the supervising architects who served on the Capitol, carrying out the design of Dr. William Thornton, as well as with The Octagon House. \nHoban lived the rest of his life in Washington, D.C., where he worked on other public buildings and government projects, including roads and bridges.[9]\n Local folklore has it that Hoban designed Rossenarra House near the village of Kilmoganny in County Kilkenny, Ireland in 1824.[10]\n Hoban's wife, Susanna \"Susan\" Sewall, was the sister of the prominent Georgetown City Tavern proprietor,[11][12] Clement Sewall, who enlisted as a sergeant at age 19 in the Maryland Line during the Revolutionary War, was promoted six months later to ensign and then severely wounded at the Battle of Germantown.[13]\n After the District of Columbia was granted limited home rule in 1802, Hoban served on the twelve-member city council for most of the remainder of his life, except during the years he was rebuilding the White House.[14] Hoban was also involved in the development of Catholic institutions in the city, including Georgetown University (where his son was a member of the Jesuit community), St. Patrick's Parish, and the Georgetown Visitation Monastery founded by another Kilkenny native, Teresa Lalor of Ballyragget.\n Hoban died in Washington, D.C., on December 8, 1831. He was originally buried at Holmead's Burying Ground,[15] but was disinterred and reburied at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington, D.C. His son James Hoban, Jr., said to be the spit and image of his father, served as district attorney of the District of Columbia.[14]\n Little has been published to catalogue Hoban's architectural work.  \n Numerous events were held around 2008 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth.\n In 2008, a memorial arbor to honor James Hoban was completed near his birthplace, and a major exhibition on his life took place at the White House Visitor Center.[30]\n Dublin Made Him..., a one-day colloquium in honour of Hoban, took place on October 3, 2008, at the (RDS) in Dublin, Ireland.[31] It was presented by the RDS in association with the White House Historical Association, the U.S. Embassy in Ireland, and the James Hoban Societies of the U.S. and Ireland.\n The Irish-American musical group Solas have a song \"John Riordan's Heels/The Bath Jig/Hoban's White House\" on their album For Love and Laughter. Group member Mick McAuley, like Hoban, is from Kilkenny, and named the song in Hoban's honor.\n ", "tags": ["1758 births", "1831 deaths", "18th-century American architects", "Federalist architects", "Irish architects", "Irish emigrants to the United States (before 1923)", "People from Callan, County Kilkenny", "Burials at Mount Olivet Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)", "Burials at Holmead's Burying Ground", "American slave owners", "19th-century American architects", "Irish slave owners", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the ODNB", "Pages using cite ODNB with id parameter", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " Waxen bas-relief on glass of Hoban, circa 1800\nJames Hoban  (1758[1] \u2013 December 8, 1831) was an Irish architect, best known for designing the White House in Washington, D.C.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Work\n\n2.1 Attributed buildings\n2.2 Demolished buildings\n\n\n3 Commemorations\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 Bibliography\n7 Further reading\n\n\nLife[edit]\nJames Hoban was a Roman Catholic raised on an estate belonging to the Earl of Desart in Callan, County Kilkenny, Ireland.
