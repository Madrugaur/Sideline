{"name": "G\u00e1bor Tardos", "content": "G\u00e1bor Tardos (born 11 July 1964) is a Hungarian mathematician, currently a professor at Central European University and previously a Canada Research Chair at Simon Fraser University. He works mainly in combinatorics and computer science. He is the younger brother of \u00c9va Tardos.[1]\n G\u00e1bor Tardos received his PhD in Mathematics from E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University, Budapest in 1988. His counsellors were L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai and P\u00e9ter P\u00e1lfy. He held postdoctoral posts at the University of Chicago, Rutgers University, University of Toronto and the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. From 2005 to 2013, he served as a Canada Research Chair of discrete and computational geometry at the Simon Fraser University. He then returned to Budapest to the Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics where he has served as a research fellow since 1991.[2]\n Tardos started with a result in universal algebra: he exhibited a maximal clone of monotone operations which is not finitely  generated. He obtained partial results concerning the Hanna Neumann conjecture.[3] With his student, Adam Marcus, he proved a combinatorial conjecture of Zolt\u00e1n F\u00fcredi and P\u00e9ter Hajnal which was known to imply the Stanley\u2013Wilf conjecture.
