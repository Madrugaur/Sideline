He received his PhD in 1909 from the University of Budapest (later renamed to E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University), under the stewardship of Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r, among whose students were other mathematicians such as Paul Erd\u0151s, John von Neumann, P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n and George P\u00f3lya. After completing his PhD he left to University of G\u00f6ttingen, which in those days was considered a mathematics hub, and subsequently returned to the University of Budapest, where he attained the title of Privatdozent. In addition, Fekete engaged in private mathematics tutoring. Among his students was J\u00e1nos Neumann, who, was later known in the United States as John von Neumann. In 1922, Fekete published a paper together with von Neumann in the subject of extremal polynomials. This was von Neumann's first scientific paper. Fekete dedicated the majority of his scientific work to the transfinite diameter.\n In 1928 he immigrated to Mandate Palestine and was among the first instructors in the Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1929 he was promoted to professor in the institute. Eventually he succeeded the mathematicians Edmund Landau and Adolf Abraham Halevi Fraenkel in heading the institute. He later moved on to become the dean of Natural Sciences, and between the years 1946\u20131948 he was Hebrew University Provost.\n Among his students were Aryeh Dvoretzky, Amnon Jakimovski and Michael Bahir Maschler.\n In 1955, Fekete was awarded the Israel Prize for exact sciences.[2]\n ", "tags": ["Israeli mathematicians", "Hungarian emigrants to Israel", "Hungarian Jews", "People from Senta", "Jews in Mandatory Palestine", "Israeli Jews", "Israeli people of Hungarian-Jewish descent", "Israel Prize in exact science recipients", "Israel Prize in exact science recipients who were mathematicians", "1886 births", "1957 deaths", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Michael (Mih\u00e1ly) FeketeMichael FeketeBorn(1886-07-19)19 July 1886Zenta, Austria-Hungary, (today Senta, Serbia)Died13 May 1957(1957-05-13) (aged\u00a070)Jerusalem, IsraelNationalityIsraelAlma\u00a0materUniversity of BudapestKnown\u00a0forFekete's lemma, Fekete polynomialAwardsIsrael Prize for Exact Sciences (1955)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsBudapest UniversityHebrew UniversityDoctoral advisorLip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9rDoctoral studentsAryeh DvoretzkyMichael Bahir MaschlerZeev NehariMenahem Max Schiffer\n\nMichael (Mih\u00e1ly) Fekete (Hebrew: \u05de\u05d9\u05db\u05d0\u05dc \u05e4\u05e7\u05d8\u05d4\u200e; 19 July 1886 \u2013 13 May 1957) was a Hungarian-Israeli mathematician.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Awards\n3 See also\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\n Mathematics professor Michael Fekete, the Provost of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, with his water quota, during the siege of Jerusalem\nFekete was born in 1886 in Zenta, Austria-Hungary (today Senta, Serbia).
