{"name": "Philip M'Pherson", "content": "Philip Keith M'Pherson (1927 - 27 April 2016) was a British systems engineer, consultant, Emeritus Professor of Systems Engineering & Management at the City University London,[1] and founder of the Department of Systems Science at City University,[2] also known as developer of the Inclusive Valuation Methodology.[3][4]\n Born in London, United Kingdom, M'Pherson was educated as an engineer at Oxford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[5] He started his career as \"hard-hat practitioner\"[6] at the Royal Navy, where he became gunnery engineer officer specialized in fire-control systems. In 1955 he was sent to MIT's Instrumentation Laboratory run by Charles Stark Draper to work on the development of Inertial navigation systems sharing ideas with pioneers as Norbert Wiener and Harold Chestnut.[5]\n Early 1960s M'Pherson left the Royal Navy and started for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, where he founded a research group focussed on the controlling of nuclear power reactors. They particularly focussed on \"constructing mathematical models of nuclear reactor spatial dynamics using early digital computers with punched tape input-output.\"[5] Mid-1960s he returned to the academic world to St John's College, Oxford. In 1967 he was appointed Professor of Systems Science at the City University London from 1967 to 1983, and Professor of Systems Engineering and Management from 1983[1] until his retirement in 1989.[2] In 1972 he co-founded the Department of Systems Science at City University in London, which he headed for years. From 1981 to 1989 he was also Pro-vice-chancellor at the City University in London.\n Beside his academic work M'Pherson worked as a management consultant and was director of the Systems & Value Limited company.\n In 2006 M'Pherson was awarded the INCOSE Pioneer Award, acknowledging that \"his appreciation for precise mathematical modeling in system design influenced submarine design for decades to follow...
