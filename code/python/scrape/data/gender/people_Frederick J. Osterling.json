{"name": "Frederick J.

Following his schooling in Allegheny City, Osterling began work in the office of Joseph Stillburg, and was published in American Architect and Building News at age 18.[1] Following a period of European travel, he launched his own practice in 1888. During his career he designed many prominent Pittsburgh buildings, such as the Union Trust Building (1915\u201317). According to Martin Aurand, Architecture Librarian at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh,[2] Osterling's practice faltered after controversy relating to his anticipated alteration to the landmark H.H.
