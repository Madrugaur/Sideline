On September 19, 2006, Wood announced that Simian had signed The Apples in Stereo as their first band, with their new album New Magnetic Wonder released in February 2007.[37] In addition, he also directed the music video for \"Energy\".[38]\nWood has also provided voiceovers for video games, including the voice of Spyro the Dragon in the Legend of Spyro game trilogy,[39] as well as reprising Mumble in the game version of Happy Feet.[40]\nOn April 11, 2008, Wood was the guest host of Channel 4's Friday Night Project. On April 25, 2009, Wood was honored with the Midnight Award by the San Francisco International Film Festival as an American actor who \"has made outstanding contributions to independent and Hollywood cinema, and who brings striking intelligence, exemplary talent and extraordinary depth of character to his roles\".[41]\nIn addition to producing and acting, Wood has become a well-known disc jockey. Together with his friend Zach Cowie, they formed Wooden Wisdom and have toured around the world. They have spun at events such as the Bushmills Live 2012 festival at the Old Bushmills Distillery, the opening of the Brickell City Centre and at the pre-Emmy party at The London West Hollywood hotel.[42][43]\nWood signed up to co-produce and also star in the film Black Wings Has My Angel, based on the noir novel of the same name, with Anthony Moody and Rob Malkani of Indalo Productions.

Waller, founded The Woodshed, a production company that promotes horror films. In 2013, the company was re-branded as SpectreVision.[45]\nWood voiced Shay, one of two main characters in the adventure game Broken Age, for which he received the 2014 Performance in a Comedy, Lead award from National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR).[46]\nWood together with Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, and Karl Urban, plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson on May 31, 2020 joined Josh Gad's YouTube series Reunited Apart which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[47]\n\nCharity work[edit]\nOn April 23, 2010, in a charitable gesture, Wood visited the Chilean town of Curepto, one of the hardest hit by the 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck on February 27, 2010. He made personal visits to many of the victims and was accompanied by the First Lady of Chile, Cecilia Morel.[48][49]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nThis article contains a list of miscellaneous information. Please relocate any relevant information into other sections or articles. (March 2021)\nWood has a tattoo of the number nine written in the Sindarin language, which uses the Tengwar script, and in the English language (rather than Quenya as is widely believed) below his waist on the right side. It refers to his character as one of the Fellowship of the Ring. The other actors of \"The Fellowship\" got the same tattoo, with the exception of John Rhys-Davies, whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.[50]\nIn May 2006, Wood was ranked at No. 7 on Autograph Collector Magazine's list of the \"10 Best Hollywood Autograph Signers\".[51]\nWood was an active supporter of Bernie Sanders during the 2016 presidential election.[52]\nIn 2016, Wood discussed his belief that organized child sexual abuse happens in Hollywood.[53]\nIn 2019, Wood and Danish film producer Mette-Marie Kongsved had their first child together.[54]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nMain article: Elijah Wood filmography\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Elijah Wood Biography\".
