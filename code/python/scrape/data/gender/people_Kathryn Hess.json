{"name": "Kathryn Hess", "content": "\n Kathryn Hess (born 1967)[1] is a professor of mathematics at \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) and is known for her work on homotopy theory, category theory, and algebraic topology, both pure and applied. In particular, she applies the methods of algebraic topology to better understanding neurology[2], cancer biology, and materials science. She is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.\n Kathryn Hess was born 21 September 1967 in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.
