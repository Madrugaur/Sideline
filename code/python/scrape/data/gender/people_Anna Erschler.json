She specializes in geometric group theory and probability theory, in particular, random walks on groups.[1]\n Beginning in 1994 Erschler studied mathematics at Saint Petersburg State University receiving there her M.Sc. in 1999 and then studied in the academic year 1999\u20132000 at Tel Aviv University. In 2001 she received her Ph.D. from Saint Petersburg State University under the direction of  Anatoly Vershik, with a thesis titled Geometric und probabilistic properties of wreath products.[2] In October 2012 she received her habilitation (Th\u00e8se d'\u00c9tat) from the University of Paris 11.[1]\n She was a postdoc in the academic year 2001\u20132002 at the Steklov Institute in Saint Petersburg and in the academic year 2002\u20132003 at the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques in Paris and at IRMAR in Rennes. From October 2003 to December 2005 she was Charg\u00e9e de recherche at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique, University of Lille. At CNRS, University Paris 11, she was from January 2006 to September 2013 Charg\u00e9e de recherch\u00e9 and then from October 2013 to April 2013 Directrice de recherche. From May 2014 she has been Directrice de recherche at CNRS, DMA/ENS, Orsay.[1]\n She is a co-editor of the journal Groups, Geometry and Dynamics.\n Erschler received in 2001 the M\u00f6bius Prize of the Independent University of Moscow and in 2002 the Annual Prize of the Saint Petersburg Mathematical Society. In 2010 she was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Hyderabad, where she gave a talk on Poisson\u2013Furstenberg boundaries, large-scale geometry and growth of groups. In the summer of 2010 at the University of G\u00f6ttingen she was the ninth Emmy Noether visiting professor, lecturing on random walks and Poisson\u2013Furstenberg boundaries.[3] In 2015 she received the \u00c9lie Cartan Prize of the French Academy of Sciences.\n ", "tags": ["1977 births", "Living people", "Saint Petersburg State University alumni", "20th-century Russian mathematicians", "21st-century Russian mathematicians", "20th-century French mathematicians", "21st-century French mathematicians", "French women mathematicians", "Group theorists", "Probability theorists", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Russian mathematician\nAnna Gennadievna Erschler, n\u00e9e Dyubina, (\u0410\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0434\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u042d\u0440\u0448\u043b\u0435\u0440; born 14 February 1977), is a Russian-born mathematician, working in France.
