{"name": "Claud Beelman", "content": "Claud W. Beelman (1883 \u2013 January 30, 1963), sometimes known as Claude Beelman, was an American architect who designed many examples of Beaux-Arts, Art Deco, and Streamline Moderne style buildings.  Many of his buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n Beelman was married to Lourene Taft Beelman (b. 1883, Ohio - d. 1948, Ca.).  In 1910, he was  a draftsman in the state of Indiana.  (Cite:  U.S. Census Records, State of Indiana, 1910.)  It was there they had a daughter, Helen Beelman (b. 1912).  By the 1920s, the family had relocated to Los Angeles, and by 1930, they lived in Beverly Hills.\n From the 1920s on, Beelman, as partner or owner of one or another of several firms (Curlett + Beelman; Allison & Allison; Ruck & Beelman; Claud Beelman & Associates) designed a number of prominent civic and private structures. By 1956, Claude Beelman & Associates officed at 7421 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles 90036.\n When he was in his seventies, Beelman designed the 12-story Superior Oil building  for oil tycoon W.M. Keck. Completed in 1955, the Superior Oil building later became  The Bank of California Building, and was used for the bank's offices until the 1980s.  By the late 1990s the building had been vacant for nearly ten years, but has been renovated beginning in 2000 by hotel developer Andre Balazs, and now is the location of his hotel The Standard.\n It is the zig-zag moderne Eastern Columbia Building, however, with its facade of turquoise green terra cotta tile, ornate clock tower, art deco lighting, fixtures, signage and architectural detail that is Beelman's most recognizable work.  In 2006, the Eastern Columbia Building was converted from office space to loft live/work spaces by the Kor Group and is now one of the most desirable loft buildings in Downtown Los Angeles.\n Some of the California landmark buildings designed by Beelman include (All located in Los Angeles, California unless otherwise noted):\n }}\n ", "tags": ["1883 births", "1963 deaths", "20th-century American architects", "Art Deco architects", "Streamline Moderne architects", "Artists from Los Angeles", "Architects from Ohio", "Architects from California", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from November 2019", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American architect\nClaud BeelmanBorn1883OhioDiedJanuary 30, 1963Los Angeles, CaliforniaNationalityAmericanOccupationArchitectSpouse(s)Lourene Taft BeelmanChildren1 daughterBuildingsSuperior Oil Company Building\n\nClaud W.
