{"name": "Kay Fisker", "content": "Kay Otto Fisker, Hon. FAIA (14 February 1893 \u2013 21 June 1965) was a Danish architect, designer and educator. He is mostly known for his many housing projects, mainly in the Copenhagen area, and is considered a leading exponent of Danish Functionalism.\n Kay Fisker was born on 14 February 1893 in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen. He entered the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1909 and while there worked at the offices of leading Scandinavian architects such as Anthon Rosen, Sigurd Lewerentz, Gunnar Asplund and Hack Kampmann parallel to his studies. In 1915, in collaboration with Aage Rafn, he won a competition to design the railway stations along the Almindingen-Gudhjem railway on the Danish island of Bornholm.[1]\n After graduating, his career as a practising architect was dominated by numerous influential residential projects. Vesters\u00f8hus was built from 1935 to 1939 by Fisker and C. F. M\u00f8ller. It instantly became a model in Denmark for the balcony and bay window blocks of the time.[2]\n A key building in his production was Aarhus University (1931\u201343), considered to be one of the most important examples of Danish Functionalism, which he designed in collaboration with C.

Kay Fisker also designed the Danish Academy in Rome.[1]\n From 1936 to 1963 Fisker was a professor at the Royal Academy and as teacher of the school's class on housing he was known as an inspiring lecturer with great influence on Danish housing culture.
