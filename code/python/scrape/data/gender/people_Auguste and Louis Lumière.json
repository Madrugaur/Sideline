{"name": "Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re", "content": "\n The Lumi\u00e8re brothers (UK: /\u02c8lu\u02d0mi\u025b\u0259r/, US: /\u02cclu\u02d0mi\u02c8\u025b\u0259r/; French:\u00a0[lymj\u025b\u02d0\u0281]), Auguste Marie Louis Nicolas Lumi\u00e8re (19 October 1862 \u2013 10 April 1954) and Louis Jean Lumi\u00e8re (5 October 1864 \u2013 7 June 1948),[1][2] were manufacturers of photography equipment, best known for their Cin\u00e9matographe motion picture system and the short films they produced between 1895 and 1905. Their screening of a single film on 22 March 1895 for around 200 members of the \"Society for the Development of the National Industry\" in Paris was probably the first presentation of projected film. Their first commercial public screening on 28 December 1895 for around 40 paying visitors and invited relations has traditionally been regarded as the birth of cinema, although it had in fact been preceded by paying shows to thousands of people in the United States and Germany. \n The Lumi\u00e8re brothers were born in Besan\u00e7on, France, to Charles-Antoine Lumi\u00e8re (1840\u20131911)[3] and Jeanne Jos\u00e9phine Costille Lumi\u00e8re, who were married in 1861 and moved to Besan\u00e7on, setting up a small photographic portrait studio where Auguste and Louis were born. They moved to Lyon in 1870, where son Edouard and three daughters were born. Auguste and Louis both attended La Martiniere, the largest technical school in Lyon.[4] Their father Charles-Antoine set up a small factory producing photographic plates, but even with Louis and a young sister working from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. it teetered on the verge of bankruptcy, and by 1882 it looked as if they would fail. When Auguste returned from military service, the boys designed the machines necessary to automate their father's plate production and devised a very successful new photo plate, 'etiquettes bleue', and by 1884 the factory employed a dozen workers.[citation needed]\n They patented several significant processes leading up to their film camera, most notably film perforations (originally implemented by Emile Reynaud) as a means of advancing the film through the camera and projector. The original cin\u00e9matographe had been patented by L\u00e9on Guillaume Bouly on 12 February 1892.[5] The cin\u00e9matographe \u2014 a three-in-one device that could record, develop, and project motion pictures \u2014 was further developed by the Lumi\u00e8res.[6] The brothers patented their own version on 13 February 1895.[7]\n The date of the recording of their first film is in dispute. In an interview with Georges Sadoul given in 1948, Louis Lumi\u00e8re claimed that he shot the film in August 1894 - before the arrival of the kinetoscope in France. This is questioned by historians, who consider that a functional Lumi\u00e8re camera did not exist before the beginning of 1895.[8]\n The Lumi\u00e8re brothers saw film as a novelty and had withdrawn from the film business by 1905. They went on to develop the first practical photographic colour process, the Lumi\u00e8re Autochrome.[citation needed]\n Louis died on 6 June 1948 and Auguste on 10 April 1954. They are buried in a family tomb in the New Guilloti\u00e8re Cemetery in Lyon.[citation needed]\n On 22 March 1895 in Paris, at the \"Society for the Development of the National Industry\", in front of a small audience, one of whom was said to be L\u00e9on Gaumont, then director of the company the Comptoir G\u00e9neral de la Photographie, the Lumi\u00e8res privately screened a single film, La Sortie de l'usine Lumi\u00e8re \u00e0 Lyon. The main focus of the conference by Louis Lumi\u00e8re concerned the recent developments in the photographic industry, mainly the research on polychromy (colour photography). It was much to Lumi\u00e8re's surprise that the moving black-and-white images retained more attention than the coloured stills.[9] The American Woodville Latham screened films to a paying public two months later on 20 May 1895 at 156 Broadway, New York City.[10]\n The Lumi\u00e8res gave their first paid public screening on 28 December 1895, at Salon Indien du Grand Caf\u00e9 in Paris.[11] This presentation consisted of the following 10 short films, lasting 50 seconds each, (in order of presentation):[12][13]\n Each film is 17 meters long, which, when hand cranked through a projector, runs approximately 50 seconds.[citation needed]\n The Lumi\u00e8res went on tour with the cin\u00e9matographe in 1896, visiting cities including Brussels, Bombay, London, Montreal, New York City, and Buenos Aires.[14]\n In 1896, only a few months after the initial screenings in Europe, films by the Lumiere Brothers were shown in Egypt, first in the Tousson stock exchange in Alexandria on 5 November 1896 and then in the Hamam Schneider (Schneider Bath) in Cairo.[15][16]\n [clarification needed] Their actuality films, or actualit\u00e9s, are often cited as the first, primitive documentaries, but they had been preceded in this by the work of Birt Acres and Robert Paul in Britain. They made the first steps towards slapstick films with L'Arroseur Arros\u00e9, and the early versions of Le Saut \u00e0 la couverture and La Voltige[citation needed]\n The brothers stated that \"the cinema is an invention without any future\" and declined to sell their camera to other filmmakers such as Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s. This made many film makers upset. Consequently, their role in the history of film was exceedingly brief. In parallel with their cinema work they experimented with colour photography. They worked on a number of colour photographic processes in the 1890s including the Lippmann process (interference heliochromy) and their own 'bichromated glue' process,[17] a subtractive colour process, examples of which were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900. This last process was commercialised by the Lumieres but commercial success had to wait for their next colour process. In 1903 they patented a colour photographic process, the Autochrome Lumi\u00e8re, which was launched on the market in 1907.[18] Throughout much of the 20th century, the Lumi\u00e8re company was a major producer of photographic products in Europe, but the brand name, Lumi\u00e8re, disappeared from the marketplace following merger with Ilford.[19]\n Earlier moving images in for instance phantasmagoria shows, the ph\u00e9nakisticope, the zoetrope and \u00c9mile Reynaud's Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique consisted of hand-drawn images. A system that could record reality in motion, in a fashion much like it is seen by the eyes, had a greater impact on people. \n Eadweard Muybridge's Zoopraxiscope projected moving painted silhouettes based on his chronophotography photography. The only Zoopraxiscope disc with actual photographs was made with an early form of stop motion. Less-known predecessors, such as Jules Duboscq's Bioscope were not projected.\n Louis Le Prince's Roundhay Garden Scene (1888) is now widely regarded as the first example of filmed moving pictures, but Le Prince disappeared without a trace in 1890 before he managed to present his work or publish about it.\n William Friese-Greene patented a \"machine camera\" in 1889, which embodied many aspects of later film cameras. He displayed the results at photographic societies in 1890 and developed further cameras but did not publicly project the results.[20][21]\n Ottomar Ansch\u00fctz's Electrotachyscope projected very short loops of high photographic quality. \n Thomas Edison believed projection of films wasn't as viable a business model as offering the films in the \"peepshow\" kinetoscope device. Watching the images on the screen turned out to be much preferred by audiences. Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope (developed by William Kennedy Dickson), premiered publicly in 1894.[22]\n Kazimierz Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski allegedly built his camera and projecting device, called Pleograph, in 1894. \n Lauste and Latham's Eidoloscope was demonstrated for members of the press on 21 April 1895, and opened to the paying public on Broadway on 20 May.[23] They shot films up to twenty minutes long at speeds over thirty frames per second and showed them in many US cities.[20] The Eidoloscope Company was dissolved in 1896 after various internal disputes.\n Max and Emil Skladanowsky, inventors of the Bioscop, had offered projected moving images to a paying public in Berlin from 1 November 1895 until the end of the month. Their machinery was relatively cumbersome and their films much shorter. Their booking in Paris was cancelled after the news of the Lumi\u00e8re screening. Nonetheless, they toured their films to other countries.[20]\n ", "tags": ["Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re", "1862 births", "1864 births", "1948 deaths", "1954 deaths", "People from Besan\u00e7on", "Color scientists", "Sibling filmmakers", "Sibling duos", "French film directors", "French businesspeople", "French inventors", "Pioneers of photography", "Cinema pioneers", "History of film", "Cinema of France", "La Martini\u00e8re Lyon alumni", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Order of the Francisque recipients", "Recipients of the Order of St. Sava", "French cinema pioneers", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Webarchive template archiveis links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from December 2020", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from December 2020", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from April 2020", "Articles needing additional references from December 2020", "All articles needing additional references", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Articles containing video clips"], "raw": "19/20th-century French filmmakers and photography equipment manufacturers\n\n\nAuguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8reAuguste (left) and Louis (right)BornAuguste Marie Louis Nicolas Lumi\u00e8re(1862-10-19)19 October 1862Louis Jean Lumi\u00e8re(1864-10-05)5 October 1864Besan\u00e7on, FranceDiedAuguste10 April 1954(1954-04-10) (aged\u00a091)Lyon, FranceLouis6 June 1948(1948-06-06) (aged\u00a083)Bandol, FranceResting placeNew Guilloti\u00e8re Cemetery (location A6)Alma\u00a0materLa Martiniere LyonOccupation\nFilmmakers\nInventors\nParent(s)\nCharles-Antoine Lumi\u00e8re (1840\u20131911)\nJeanne Jos\u00e9phine Costille Lumi\u00e8re (1841\u20131915)\nAwardsElliott Cresson Medal (1909)\nThe Lumi\u00e8re brothers (UK: /\u02c8lu\u02d0mi\u025b\u0259r/, US: /\u02cclu\u02d0mi\u02c8\u025b\u0259r/; French:\u00a0[lymj\u025b\u02d0\u0281]), Auguste Marie Louis Nicolas Lumi\u00e8re (19 October 1862 \u2013 10 April 1954) and Louis Jean Lumi\u00e8re (5 October 1864 \u2013 7 June 1948),[1][2] were manufacturers of photography equipment, best known for their Cin\u00e9matographe motion picture system and the short films they produced between 1895 and 1905.
