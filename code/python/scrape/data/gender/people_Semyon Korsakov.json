He later was to serve as an official in the statistics department of the Russian Police Ministry in St. Petersburg.  He was a recipient of the Order of St. Anna and the Order of St. Vladimir.\n Korsakov died in 1853 in the village of Tarusovo, then part of the Moscow Province.\n Though Korsakov was not formally trained as a doctor, he was interested in medicine, possibly because of the difficulty in getting medical care in the rural area where he lived.  According to his journals he treated several thousand patients, at first using conventional medicine, but in 1829 switching to homeopathy at the urging of his relatives.\n Korsakov is noted in homeopathic circles as the originator of the Korsakovian method of dilution, which differed from the Hahnemannian dilutions used by (and named for) homeopathy's founder in that it used a single container for a series of dilutions rather than a new container for each.  Korsakov also used dilutions higher than those previously used (30C and higher).  Dilutions made using his method are commonly designated with the letter \"K\", e.g. 15K.\n While working in the statistics department of the Police Ministry, Korsakov became intrigued with the possibility of using machinery to \"enhance natural intelligence\".
