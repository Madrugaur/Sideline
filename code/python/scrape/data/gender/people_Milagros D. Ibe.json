[1][2] Dr. Ibe devised teacher-training programs and research studies[3] that led to the development of policies in basic and higher education [4] in the Philippines.

She graduated summa cum laude from the now defunct Quezon College in Manila, with a BA in English and BSc major in mathematics. She taught for a few years in her hometown before she transferred to teach at the University of the Philippines Rural High School at Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna. Eventually, she moved to the University of the Philippines Diliman, where she finished her Master of Arts major in curriculum and instruction. Later on, she got her PhD from the University of Toronto in Canada. She almost became Dean of the College of Education in 1990, but instead she became Vice Chancellor of the University of the Philippines Diliman.\n In 1993 Ibe was appointed Director of the University of the Philippines - Institute for Science and Mathematics Education Development (UP-ISMED). The Dolores Hernandez Lecture Series in science education was started by her during the start of her term, to be a monthly Friday afternoon event as part of the Institution's extension activities.
