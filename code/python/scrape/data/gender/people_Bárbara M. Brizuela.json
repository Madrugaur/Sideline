Prior to that, she received a Master of Arts, General Studies in Education from Tufts and a Licenciada en Ciencias Pedag\u00f3gicas and Licenciada en Psicopedagog\u00eda degrees from the Universidad de Belgrano. She was a Spencer Fellow at the Harvard Graduate School of Education from 1997 until 2000 and a Roy E.

She mainly studies children's learning of written mathematical representations as well as children's construction of algebraic understandings in a line of work called \"Early Algebra\". She is a member of the Early Algebra Project, an NSF-funded longitudinal study of the effects of introducing some algebraic concepts to children in elementary school,[2] and was the Principal Investigator of a study created to follow up the children of the Early Algebra study into middle and high school, also funded by the NSF.  She is also involved in the Noyce Teacher Fellowship Program at Tufts and in the research effort surrounding Tufts's Poincar\u00e9 Institute for Mathematics Education, an NSF NSF MSP project.\n In 2004, her book Mathematical Development in Young Children: Exploring Notations was published.[3] This book was later translated into Portuguese.\n In 2007, she published the book Bringing Out the Algebraic Character of Arithmetic: From Children\u2019s Ideas to Classroom Practice with her colleagues Anal\u00facia Schliemann and David Carraher.
