{"name": "R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter", "content": "R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter, born R\u00f3zsa Politzer, (17 February 1905 \u2013 16 February 1977) was a Hungarian mathematician and logician. She is best known as the \"founding mother of recursion theory\".[1][2]\n P\u00e9ter was born in Budapest, Hungary, as R\u00f3zsa Politzer (Hungarian: Politzer R\u00f3zsa). She attended P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter University (now E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University), originally studying chemistry but later switching to mathematics. She attended lectures by Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r and J\u00f3zsef K\u00fcrsch\u00e1k. While at university, she met L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kalm\u00e1r; they would collaborate in future years and Kalm\u00e1r encouraged her to pursue her love of mathematics.[3]\n After graduating in 1927, P\u00e9ter could not find a permanent teaching position although she had passed her exams to qualify as a mathematics teacher. Due to the effects of the Great Depression, many university graduates could not find work and P\u00e9ter began private tutoring.[4] At this time, she also began her graduate studies.\n Initially, P\u00e9ter began her graduate research on number theory. Upon discovering that her results had already been proven by the work of Robert Carmichael and L. E. Dickson, she abandoned mathematics to focus on poetry. However, she was convinced to return to mathematics by her friend L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kalm\u00e1r, who suggested she research the work of Kurt G\u00f6del on the theory of incompleteness.[3] She prepared her own, different proofs to G\u00f6del's work.[5]\n P\u00e9ter presented the results of her paper on recursive theory, \"Rekursive Funktionen,\" to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich, Switzerland in 1932. For her research, she received her PhD summa cum laude in 1935. In 1936, she presented a paper entitled \"\u00dcber rekursive Funktionen der zweiten Stufe\" to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo.[3] These papers helped to found the modern field of recursive function theory as a separate area of mathematical research.[6][7]\n In 1937, she was appointed as contributing editor of the Journal of Symbolic Logic.[4]\n After the passage of the Jewish Laws of 1939 in Hungary, P\u00e9ter was forbidden to teach because of her Jewish origin and was briefly confined to a ghetto in Budapest. During World War II, she wrote her book Playing with Infinity: Mathematical Explorations and Excursions, a work for lay readers on the topics of number theory and logic. Originally published in Hungarian, it has been translated into English and at least a dozen other languages.[8]\n With the end of the war in 1945, P\u00e9ter received her first full-time teaching appointment at the Budapest Teachers\u2019 Training College. In 1952, she was the first Hungarian woman to be made an Academic Doctor of Mathematics. After the College closed in 1955, she taught at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University until her retirement in 1975. She was a popular professor, known as \"Aunt R\u00f3zsa\" to her students.[4]\n In 1951, she published her key work, Recursive Functions (Rekursive Funtionen). She continued to publish important papers on recursive theory throughout her life. In 1959 she presented a major paper \"\u00dcber die Verallgemeinerung der Theorie der rekursiven Funktionen f\u00fcr abstrakte Mengen geeigneter Struktur als Definitionsbereiche\" to the International Symposium in Warsaw (later published in two parts in 1961 and 1962).[3]\n Beginning in the mid-1950s, P\u00e9ter applied recursive function theory to computers. Her final book, published in 1976, was Recursive Functions in Computer Theory. Originally published in Hungarian, it was the second Hungarian mathematical book to be published in the Soviet Union because its subject matter was considered indispensable to the theory of computers. It was translated into English in 1981.[9]\n P\u00e9ter was awarded the Kossuth Prize in 1951. She received the Man\u00f3 Beke Prize by the J\u00e1nos Bolyai Mathematical Society in 1953, the Silver State Prize in 1970, and the Gold State Prize in 1973. In 1973, she became the first woman to be elected to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.[3]\n ", "tags": ["Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "Hungarian Jews", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "1905 births", "1977 deaths", "20th-century women scientists", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Jewish scientists", "E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University alumni", "E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University faculty", "Computability theorists", "Theoretical computer scientists", "Mathematicians from Budapest", "Mathematical logicians", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Semantic Scholar author identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian mathematician\nThe native form of this personal name is P\u00e9ter R\u00f3zsa.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\n R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter\nR\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter, born R\u00f3zsa Politzer, (17 February 1905 \u2013 16 February 1977) was a Hungarian mathematician and logician.
