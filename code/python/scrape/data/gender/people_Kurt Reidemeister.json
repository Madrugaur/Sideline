{"name": "Kurt Reidemeister", "content": "Kurt Werner Friedrich Reidemeister (13 October 1893 \u2013 8 July 1971) was a mathematician born in Braunschweig (Brunswick), Germany.\n He was a brother of Marie Neurath.\nBeginning in 1912, he studied in Freiburg, Munich, Marburg, and G\u00f6ttingen. In 1920, he got the staatsexamen (master's degree) in mathematics, philosophy, physics, chemistry, and geology.\nHe received his doctorate in 1921 with a thesis in algebraic number theory at the University of Hamburg under the supervision of Erich Hecke.[1][2][3]\n He became interested in differential geometry; he edited Wilhelm Blaschke's 2nd volume about that issue,[4] and both made an acclaimed contribution to the Jena DMV conference in Sep 1921.[5][6]\n In October 1922[2][3] (or 1923)[1] he was appointed assistant professor at the University of Vienna. While there he became familiar with the work of Wilhelm Wirtinger on knot theory, and became closely connected to Hans Hahn and the Vienna Circle. Its  manifesto (1929) lists one of Reidemeister's publications[7] in a bibliography of closely related authors.\n In 1925 he became full professor at University of K\u00f6nigsberg; he stayed until 1933, when he was regarded politically unsound by the Nazis, and dismissed from his chair. \n Blaschke managed to get a promise about Reidemeister's reappointment, and in autumn 1934 he got the chair of Kurt Hensel in Marburg. He stayed there, except for a visit to the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study in 1948\u20131950, until he got appointed to G\u00f6ttingen University in 1955, where he stayed until his emeritation.[1][2][3]\n Reidemeister's interests were mainly in combinatorial group theory, combinatorial topology, geometric group theory, and the foundations of geometry. His books include Knoten und Gruppen (1926), Einf\u00fchrung in die kombinatorische Topologie (1932), and Knotentheorie (1932).(Knoten und Gruppen (1926) is a seminal paper by Reidemeister on knot theory. It is not a book.) He co-edited the journal Mathematische Annalen from 1947 until 1963.[8]\n ", "tags": ["1893 births", "1971 deaths", "20th-century German mathematicians", "People from Braunschweig", "Topologists", "University of Hamburg alumni", "University of Vienna faculty", "University of K\u00f6nigsberg faculty", "Vienna Circle", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\nKurt Werner Friedrich Reidemeister1956(1958?) in SwitzerlandBorn(1893-10-13)13 October 1893BraunschweigDied8 July 1971(1971-07-08) (aged\u00a077)G\u00f6ttingenNationalityGermanyAlma\u00a0materUniversity of HamburgSpouse(s)Elisabeth Wagner (Riga)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsThesis\u00dcber die Relativklassenzahl gewisser relativ-quadratischer Zahlk\u00f6rper\u00a0(1921)Doctoral advisorErich HeckeDoctoral studentsG\u00fcnter Hotz, Heiner Zieschang\n\nKurt Werner Friedrich Reidemeister (13 October 1893 \u2013 8 July 1971) was a mathematician born in Braunschweig (Brunswick), Germany.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Works\n3 See also\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nLife[edit]\nHe was a brother of Marie Neurath.\nBeginning in 1912, he studied in Freiburg, Munich, Marburg, and G\u00f6ttingen.
