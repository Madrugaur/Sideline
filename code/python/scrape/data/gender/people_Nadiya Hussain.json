She has five siblings: three sisters and two brothers. Hussain's Sylheti father, who originates from Beanibazar, was a chef and owned an Indian restaurant.[21] Hussain started wearing a hijab at age 14 to cover up her \"bad hair more than anything else\" because her father \"cut it really badly.\"[22][23][24] As a teenager, she was diagnosed with panic disorder and underwent cognitive behavioural therapy.[25] She revealed her mental health difficulties in a Sport Relief film[26] and tackled childhood anxiety in her book My Monster and Me.[5]\n Hussain learned basic cooking skills at school.[10] Her mother never baked and used the oven for storage.

I can and I will.[29] With more than 15 million viewers, the final was the most-watched show of 2015.[30] Her appearance on the show and ensuing popularity with audiences were deemed important steps toward shifting stereotypes about the Muslim community and acceptance about cultural diversity.[31][32][33] Hussain established a large following on social media.

She has spoken about her earlier struggles of being in an arranged marriage, saying \"It's tough \u2013 you are pretty much marrying a complete stranger... We had to live through the good and the bad, and have come out the other side.\"[80]\nIn December 2018, she and her husband married each other again.[81] They have two sons, Musa and Dawud, and a daughter, Maryam.[27][82][81]\nHussain is an ambassador for Starlight Children's Foundation, which supports lives of seriously ill children[83] and is also a WaterAid ambassador.[84] Hussain has shown her support for Armistice Day by wearing a 'poppy headscarf', designed to commemorate the number of Muslim soldiers who fought in World War One as well as promote the wearing of the poppy amongst British Muslims.[85] In 2018, Hussain became a brand ambassador for Swarovski on a campaign focusing on female empowerment.[86]\nHussain has suffered from panic attacks throughout her life.[79] She contributed a baking recipe for the YoungMinds mental health charity's HelloYellow day, for World Mental Health Day on 10 October 2018.[87]\nShe was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting and the culinary arts.[88]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nYear\nAward\nCategory\nWork\nResult\n\n\n2017\nNational Television Awards (NTA)\nFactual Entertainment[39][89]\nThe Chronicles of Nadiya\nNominated\n\n\n Royal Television Society (RTS)\nBreakthrough Star[18]\nNominated\n\n\nGrierson Awards\nBest Documentary Presenter[90]\nNominated\n\n\nWomen in Film & Television (UK)\nPresenter Award[91][92]\nWon\n\n\nBritish Book Awards\nChildren's Book of the Year[17]\nBake Me a Story\nNominated\n\n\n2018\nRTS West of England Awards\nFactual Entertainment[93]\nNadiya's British Food Adventure\nWon\n\n\nFortnum & Mason Food and Drink Awards\nProgramme[94]\nWon\n\n\nPersonality of the Year[94]\nWon\n\n\nNational Book Award\nFood And Drink Book Of The Year[95]\nNadiya\u2019s Family Favourites\nNominated\n\n\n2019\nBrand & Lifestyle Licensing Awards\nBest Brand Licensed Homewares Product or Range[76]\nMake Life Colourful Range from BlissHome\nWon\n\n\nFortnum & Mason Food and Drink Awards\nProgramme\nNadiya's Asian Odyssey\nWon\n\n\n2021\nBritish Book Awards\nNon-fiction: Lifestyle[96]\nNadiya Bakes\nNominated\n\nFilmography[edit]\nTelevision\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nChannel\n\nRole\n\n\n2015\n\nThe Great British Bake Off[30]\n\nBBC One\n\nWinner\n\n\n2015, 2016\u2014\n\nThe One Show[53][54]\n\nReporter\n\n\n2015\u2014\n\nSaturday Kitchen'[97][98]\n\nGuest chef\n\n\n2016\n\nLoose Women[14][57]\n\nITV\n\nOccasional panellist\n\n\nThe Chronicles of Nadiya[36][39][18]\n\nBBC One\n\nPresenter\n\n\nJunior Bake Off[40]\n\nCBBC\n\nJudge\n\n\n2017\n\nNadiya's British Food Adventure[6][43][44][8]\n\nBBC Two\n\nPresenter\n\n\nThe Big Family Cooking Showdown[46][47][10]\n\nCo-presenter\n\n\n2018\n\nNadiya's Family Favourites[99]\n\nPresenter\n\n\nNadiya\u2019s Party Feasts[100][101]\n\n\nNadiya's Asian Odyssey[102]\n\nBBC One\n\n\n2019\n\nNadiya: Anxiety and Me [103]\n\n\nNadiya's Time to Eat[104]\n\nBBC Two /\nNetflix\n\n\n\n2020\n\nNadiya Bakes[105]\n\nBBC Two/\nNetflix\n\n\n\nNadiya\u2019s American Melting Pot[105]\n\nBBC One\n\n\nThe Gruffalo and Me: The Remarkable Julia Donaldson\n\nInterviewed Guest[106]\n\n\n2021\n\nRemarkable Places to Eat[107]\n\nBBC Two\n\nHerself\n\nBibliography[edit]\n\n\nCategory\nYear\nTitle\nPublisher\nPublication Date\nISBN\nTie-in TV Series\n\n\nBiographies\n\n2019\n\nFinding My Voice\n\nHeadline Home\n\nOct 2019\n\nISBN\u00a09781472259967\n\n\n\n\nCookery\n\n2016\n\nNadiya's Kitchen\n\nMichael Joseph (Penguin Books)\n\nJune 2016\n\nISBN\u00a09780718184513\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nNadiya's British Food Adventure\n\nJuly 2017\n\nISBN\u00a09780718187668\n\n\u2714\n\n\n2018\n\nNadiya's Family Favourites\n\nJune 2018\n\nISBN\u00a09780241348994\n\n\u2714\n\n\n2019\n\nTime to Eat\n\nJuly 2019\n\nISBN\u00a09780241396599\n\n\u2714\n\n\n2020\n\nNadiya Bakes\n\nJuly 2020\n\nISBN\u00a09780241396612\n\n\u2714\n\n\nChildren's\n\n2016\n\nNadiya's Bake Me a Story\n\nHodder Children's Books\n\nSep 2016\n\nISBN\u00a09781444933277\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nNadiya's Bake Me a Festive Story\n\nOct 2017\n\nISBN\u00a09781444939613\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\nNadiya's Bake Me a Celebration Story\n\nSep 2018\n\nISBN\u00a09781444939583\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\nMy Monster and Me\n\nOct 2019\n\nISBN\u00a09781444946437\n\n\n\n\nFiction\n\n2017\n\nThe Secret Lives of the Amir Sisters\n\nHarlequin\n\nJan 2017\n\nISBN\u00a09780008192266\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\nThe Fall and Rise of the Amir Sisters\n\nJan 2019\n\nISBN\u00a09780008192310\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\nThe Hopes and Triumphs of the Amir Sisters\n\nJan 2020\n\nISBN\u00a09780008192389\n\n\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Khaleeli, Homa (12 October 2015). \"Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain: 'I wasn't thinking about representing Muslims, I was thinking about my bakes'\".
