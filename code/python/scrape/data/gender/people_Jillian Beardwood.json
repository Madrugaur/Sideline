{"name": "Jillian Beardwood", "content": "Jillian\u00a0Beardwood\u00a0(1934\u20132019) was a British mathematician known for the\u00a0Beardwood-Halton-Hammersley Theorem.[1]\u00a0Published by the\u00a0Cambridge Philosophical Society\u00a0in a 1959 article entitled \"The Shortest Path Through Many Points\", the theorem provides a practical solution to the \"travelling salesman problem\".[2] The authors derived an asymptotic formula to determine the length of the shortest route for a salesman who starts at a home or office and visits a fixed number of locations before returning to the start.\n Beardwood\u00a0was born in\u00a0Norwich, England in 1934.\u00a0After attending\u00a0The Blyth School\u00a0for Girls, she studied mathematics at\u00a0St. Hugh's College, Oxford, earning first-class honors and a master\u2019s degree in 1956.[3]\n After university,\u00a0Beardwood\u00a0accepted a position at the newly formed\u00a0United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), where she was one of four postgraduate students selected to study with\u00a0John Hammersley, a professor at\u00a0Trinity College, Oxford.\u00a0In that position,\u00a0Beardwood\u00a0gained access to the\u00a0Ferranti Mercury\u00a0computer at the UKAEA\u2019s research facility at\u00a0Harwell, as well as to the\u00a0ILLIAC II computer at the\u00a0University of Illinois.\u00a0She was later promoted to Senior Scientific Officer at the UKAEA, where she specialized in\u00a0Monte Carlo methods\u00a0and algorithms for modeling complex geometrical situations.[3]\n The problem of determining the shortest closed path through a given set of\u00a0n\u00a0points is often called the \u201ctravelling salesman problem.\u201d\u00a0A salesman, starting at and finally returning to his base, visits (n-1) other towns by the shortest possible route.\u00a0If\u00a0it is large, it may be prohibitively difficult to calculate the total mileages for each of the (n-1)! orders in which the towns may be visited, and to choose the smallest total.\n As a practical substitute for an exact formula to determine the length of the shortest path, the Beardwood-Halton-Hammersley Theorem derived a simple asymptotic formula for the shortest length when\u00a0n\u00a0is large. The travelling salesman problem can involve either fixed or random points distributed over a certain region.\u00a0The Theorem established that the shortest length between random points is asymptotically equal to a non-random function of\u00a0n.\u00a0For large\u00a0n\u00a0the distinction between the random and the non-random versions of the problem effectively vanishes.  David L.
