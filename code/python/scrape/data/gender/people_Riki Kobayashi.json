{"name": "Riki Kobayashi", "content": "Riki Kobayashi (1924\u20132013) was a chemical engineer and a long-time professor of chemical engineering at Rice University. A native of Harris County, Texas, he attended Rice University (then known as Rice Institute) and earned the Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering at the age of 19.[1] After serving in the U.S. Army, he went to the University of Michigan, where he earned the Master of Science degree in 1946 and the Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1951, both in chemical engineering. He became a member of the Rice faculty in 1951 and remained there until he retired in 1994. He died July 19, 2013, in Houston, Texas.[2]\n Kobayashi was a diligent researcher who was widely known for his investigations of thermodynamic and transport properties, particularly of natural gas liquids and hydrates. He has been credited with writing at least 200 articles for professional journals. In 1949, he was a co-author of the Handbook of Natural Gas Engineering, which is still used by engineers in the industry. Later, while teaching at Rice University, he became well known for his pioneering work in phase equilibrium, physical properties and transport properties which were highly important to the development of the natural gas processing industries.[2]\n He belonged to several professional associations, including:\n He also belonged to Sigma Chi, Alpha Chi Sigma, Tau Beta Pi, Phi Lambda Upsilon, and Phi Kappa Phi.[3]\n Personally warm and approachable, Dr. Kobayashi was addressed simply as Riki by nearly all of his graduate students throughout his career.
