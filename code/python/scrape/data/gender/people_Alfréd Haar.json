{"name": "Alfr\u00e9d Haar", "content": "Alfr\u00e9d Haar (Hungarian: Haar Alfr\u00e9d; 11 October 1885, Budapest\u00a0\u2013 16 March 1933, Szeged) was a Hungarian mathematician. In 1904 he began to study at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. His doctorate was supervised by David Hilbert. The Haar measure, Haar wavelet, and Haar transform are named in his honor. Between 1912 and 1919 he taught at Franz Joseph University in Kolozsv\u00e1r. Together with Frigyes Riesz, he made the University of Szeged a centre of mathematics. He also founded the Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum journal together with Riesz.\n Haar was born to a Hungarian-Jewish[1] family in Budapest on 11 October 1885 to parents Ign\u00e1c Haar and Emma Fuchs. He graduated in 1903 from the secondary school Fasori Evang\u00e9likus Gimn\u00e1zium where he was a student of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz. He started his university studies in Budapest, later moving on to G\u00f6ttingen reading Mathematics and sciences. Among the many famous professors he was taught by, he could count Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, J\u00f3zsef K\u00fcrsch\u00e1k, Constantin Carath\u00e9odory, David Hilbert, Felix Christian Klein and Ernst Zermelo.\n During years of the secondary school, he collaborated with the mathematical journal for secondary school students K\u00f6z\u00e9piskolai Matematikai Lapok, and won the national E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd Mathematical Competition. He enrolled to the Technical University of Budapest as a student of Chemical Engineering, but in the same year he moved on to the University of Budapest, and after a year to the University of G\u00f6ttingen. His doctoral research was supervised by Hilbert graduating in June 1909. His 49-page thesis studies systems of Sturm-Liouville functions and spherical functions, introducing the now widely used Haar orthogonal systems. In the same year he habilitated to become a private professor of the university.\n In 1912, the Franz Joseph University in Kolozsv\u00e1r, Austria-Hungary (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) invited him along with Gyula Farkas and Frigyes Riesz to join as faculty, and he became the professor of 'Quatitics'. A number of his lecture notes from the time became established books later. After the Treaty of Trianon, which ceded Transylvania to Romania, the university had to move to Szeged, the closest city within the new boundaries, where he with Riesz established the Centre of Mathematics, and the first internationally recognised Hungarian mathematical journal, the Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum.\n One of his doctoral students at the University of Szeged was B\u00e9la Sz\u0151kefalvi-Nagy.\n Haar died of stomach cancer on 16 March 1933.\n His results are from the fields of mathematical analysis and topological groups, in particular he researched orthogonal systems of functions, singular integrals, analytic functions, differential equations, set theory, function approximation and calculus of variations.\n ", "tags": ["1885 births", "1933 deaths", "19th-century mathematicians", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "19th-century Hungarian people", "20th-century Hungarian people", "University of Szeged faculty", "Hungarian Jews", "Hungarian expatriates in Germany", "Writers from Budapest", "Franz Joseph University faculty", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Deaths from cancer in Hungary", "Deaths from stomach cancer", "Fasori Gimn\u00e1zium alumni", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles to be expanded from February 2011", "All articles to be expanded", "Articles needing translation from Hungarian Wikipedia", "Articles needing translation from German Wikipedia", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hungarian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian mathematician\nThis article may be expanded with text translated from the corresponding article in Hungarian.
