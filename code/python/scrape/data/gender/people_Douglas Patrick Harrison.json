{"name": "Douglas Patrick Harrison", "content": "Douglas Patrick Harrison is a Professor Emeritus of Chemical Engineer with Louisiana State University's Gordon A. and Mary Cain Department of Chemical Engineering since his retirement in 2005.[1] During his tenure he taught undergraduate and graduate classes, served as dissertation advisor to PhD and MS students, held the Department Chair position, occupied the Marguerite Voorhies Professor endowed chair, and managed research projects.\n Dr. Douglas P. Harrison received his PhD from the University of Texas in 1966.[1] After receiving his PhD, he went to work for Monsanto Company doing new product research. After three years with Monsanto he joined Louisiana State University's Chemical Engineering Department in 1969 as an Assistant Professor. Later, he served as Department Chair from 1976 to 1979[1][2] and became the Alexis and Marguerite Voorhies Endowed Professor. Throughout his career, he has been invited to lecture at conferences and colleges including Engineering Conferences International, United Engineering Foundation, American Institute of Chemical Engineers, University of Cambridge, and NATO Advanced Studies Institute. In 2005, after 36 years of service with LSU, he retired from teaching[3] and now continues three research programs as Professor Emeritus of Chemical Engineering.\n During his time he has taught the majority of undergraduate courses. He also taught the graduate course on reactor design. After his time as Department Chair, he continued working closely with the chemical engineering graduate program as a doctoral and masters dissertation advisor. He helped 10 PhD students and 31 MS students complete their program. He is the only professor to receive the Dow Chemical Excellence Teaching Award four times in 1988, 1995, 2000 and 2002.[1]\n Much of Dr. Harrison's research has been focused on separation and reaction engineering. His work has mainly been focused on the noncatalytic gas\u2013solid reactions and separation of gas associated with Coal Fired Power Plant. His other research includes new processes for the production of high hydrogen purity, removal of greenhouse gasses from Stack Gas (Flue gas), and the separation of semi-volatile contaminants from aqueous solutions.\n His current research includes three projects:\n He continues his work in \"High Efficiency Desulfurization of Synthesis Gas,\" a topic he has been working with for 25 years. Hydrogen sulfide is a pollutant and its removal helps improve efficiency of the reaction. Past research has included the use of CeO to Ce2O2S for desulfination. Current research is with the Sorbent, CeO2-ZrO2 to reduce the hydrogen sulfide content to sub-ppm content. This research is supported by the Department of Energy and is being used to help meet their Vision 21 project, a super-clean power production facility. Because of his expertise in this area, he was part of the organizing committee for the 1996 NATO Advanced Studies Institute in Ku\u015fadas\u0131, Turkey. He also took part as a lecturer and co-editor of the proceedings.\n Other research is being carried out in reduction of CO2 from flue gas using regenerable reagents. This research is working toward making an economic solution to retrofit existing stacks on power plants to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, one of the products of a combustion reaction and regarded as a pollutant thought to be a cause to Global Warming. This project is also supported by the Department of Energy and Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina and can be utilized in completion of the Vision 21 project. He was also published in the International Journal of Environmental Technology and Management 2004 \u2013 Vol. 4 for his work in this area.\n Another area of research is new Hydrogen production methods, something he has been working with for 10 years. With Professor Armando Corripio and support from NASA and TDA he has been researching how to produce 95+% Hydrogen with the use of only a single reactor, a process that currently takes 3 vessels. Other groups in the US, Japan, and Norway are also incorporating his work into their research and in 2001 he was invited to the 4th Advanced Clean Coal International Symposium in Tokyo to lecture on this topic. For his work in this area, along with colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Dr. Harrison received one of 30 awards in 2001 from the Federal Laboratory Consortium for advancing \"Technology in Service to Society.\"\n He currently holds a patent along with Klaus S. Lackner and Hans Zoick for Hydrogen Production from Carbonaceous Material.\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "American chemical engineers", "Louisiana State University faculty", "BLP articles lacking sources from September 2011", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with peacock terms from September 2011", "All articles with peacock terms", "Articles with a promotional tone from September 2011", "All articles with a promotional tone", "Articles with multiple maintenance issues", "AC with 0 elements", "Year of birth missing (living people)"], "raw": "This article has multiple issues.
