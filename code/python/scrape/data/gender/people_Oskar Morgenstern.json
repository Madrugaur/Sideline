{"name": "Oskar Morgenstern", "content": "Oskar Morgenstern (January 24, 1902 \u2013 July 26, 1977) was an economist. In collaboration with mathematician John von Neumann, he founded the mathematical field of game theory and its application to economics (see von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility theorem).[1][2]\n Companies he served as founder/co-founder of included Market Research Corporation of America, Mathematica and Mathematica Policy Research Inc.\n Morgenstern was born in G\u00f6rlitz, Germany. His mother was said to be a daughter of Emperor Frederick\u00a0III of Germany.[3][4][5][6][7]\n Morgenstern grew up in Vienna, Austria, where he also went to university. In 1925, he graduated from the University of Vienna and got his PhD in political science. From 1925 until 1928, he went on a three-year fellowship financed by the Rockefeller Foundation. After his return in 1928, he became a professor in economics at the University of Vienna until his visit to Princeton University in 1938. In 1935, Morgenstern published the article Perfect Foresight and Economic Equilibrium, after which his colleague Eduard \u010cech pointed him to an article of John von Neumann, Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele (1928).\n During Morgenstern's visit to Princeton University, Adolf Hitler took over Vienna through the Anschluss \u00d6sterreichs and Morgenstern decided to remain in the United States. He became a member of the faculty at Princeton but gravitated toward the Institute for Advanced Study. There, he met von Neumann and they collaborated to write Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, published in 1944, which is recognized as the first book on game theory. Game theory is a mathematical framework for the study of strategic structures which govern rational decision-making in certain economic, political and military situations. In 2013, the University of Vienna relocated the Faculty of Business, Economics and Statistics and named the square Oskar-Morgenstern-Platz in his honor.\n The collaboration between economist Morgenstern and mathematician von Neumann led to the birth of entirely new areas of investigation in both mathematics and economics. These have attracted widespread academic and practical interest since that time. In 1944, Morgenstern also became a United States citizen, and four years later he married Dorothy Young, with whom he had two children, Carl and Karen. In 1950, he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.[8] Morgenstern remained at Princeton as a professor of economics until his retirement in 1970, at which time he joined the faculty of New York University. Morgenstern wrote many other articles and books, including On the Accuracy of Economic Observations, and Predictability of Stock Market Prices with subsequent Nobel laureate Clive Granger.\n Morgenstern died in Princeton, New Jersey in 1977. The archive of his published works and unpublished documents is held at Duke University.[9]\n In November 2012 a place in the 9th district of Vienna, Austria was called \"Oskar-Morgenstern-Platz\"; it is the address of the Faculties of Economics and of Mathematics of the University of Vienna.\n In the late 1950s[10][11] \"Oskar Morgenstern and several of his\nPrinceton University colleagues\" began a \"small research organization.\"\n Company names with which he, along with others, were involved[12] as founders/co-founders included:\n ", "tags": ["1902 births", "1977 deaths", "Austrian people of German descent", "Game theorists", "German economists", "German emigrants to the United States", "People from G\u00f6rlitz", "People from the Province of Silesia", "Emigrants from Austria after the Anschluss", "Princeton University faculty", "Rationality theorists", "University of Vienna faculty", "Fellows of the American Statistical Association", "Fellows of the Econometric Society", "Distinguished Fellows of the American Economic Association", "Articles with hCards", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Oskar MorgensternBorn(1902-01-24)January 24, 1902G\u00f6rlitz, German EmpireDiedJuly 26, 1977(1977-07-26) (aged\u00a075)Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.NationalityAustrian and AmericanInstitutionPrinceton UniversityNew York UniversityMathematica Policy ResearchFieldEconomicsSchool\u00a0ortraditionAustrian SchoolAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ViennaDoctoraladvisorLudwig von MisesDoctoralstudentsMartin ShubikLionel W.
