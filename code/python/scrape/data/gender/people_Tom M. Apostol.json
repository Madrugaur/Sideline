He was the author of several influential graduate and undergraduate level textbooks.\n Apostol was the creator and project director for Project MATHEMATICS! producing videos which explore basic topics in high school mathematics. He helped popularize the visual calculus devised by Mamikon Mnatsakanian with whom he also wrote a number of papers, many of which appeared in the American Mathematical Monthly.  Apostol also provided academic content for an acclaimed video lecture series on introductory physics, The Mechanical Universe.\n In 2001, Apostol was elected in the Academy of Athens.[4][5] He received a Lester R.
