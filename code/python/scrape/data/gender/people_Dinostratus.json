A History of Mathematics. pp.\u00a096\u201397. Dinostratus, brother of Menaechmus, was also a mathematician, and where one of the brothers \"solved\" the duplication of the cube, the other \"solved\" the squaring of the circle. The quadrature because a simple matter once a striking property of the end point Q of the trisectrix of Hippias had been noted, apparently by Dinostratus. If the equation of the trisectrix (Fig. 6.4) is \u03c0rsin \u03b8 = 2a\u03b8, where a is the side of the square ABCD associated with the curve, [...] hence, Dinostratus' theorem is established - that is, AC/AB = AB/DQ. [...] Inasmuch as Dinostratus showed that the trisectrix of Hippias serves to square the circle, the curve more commonly came to be known as the quadratrix. It was, of course, always clear to the Greeks that the use of the curve in the trisection and quadrature problems violated the rules of the game - that circles and straight lines only were permitted. The \"solution\" of Hippias and Dinostratus, as their authors realized, were sophistic; hence, the search for further solutions, canonical or illegitimate, continued with the result that several new curves were discovered by Greek geometers.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\nBoyer, Carl B.
