{"name": "\u00c1lvaro Siza Vieira", "content": "\n \u00c1lvaro Joaquim de Melo Siza Vieira GOSE GCIH GCIP (born 25 June 1933) is a Portuguese architect, and architectural educator. He is internationally known as \u00c1lvaro Siza (Portuguese pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8alv\u0250\u027eu \u02c8siz\u0250]) and in Portugal as Siza Vieira (pronounced\u00a0[\u02c8siz\u0250 \u02c8vj\u0250j\u027e\u0250]).\n Siza was born in Matosinhos, a small coastal town near Porto. He graduated in architecture in 1955, at the former School of Fine Arts of the University of Porto, the current FAUP \u2013 Faculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade do Porto.\n Siza completed his first built work (four houses in Matosinhos) even before ending his studies in 1954, the same year that he first opened his private practice in Porto. Along with Fernando T\u00e1vora, he soon became one of the references of the Porto School of Architecture where both were teachers. Both architects worked together between 1955 and 1958. Another architect he has collaborated with is Eduardo Souto de Moura, e.g. on Portugal's flagship pavilions at Expo '98 in Lisbon and Expo 2000 in Hannover, as well as on the Serpentine Pavillon 2005. Siza's work is often described as \"poetic modernism\";[1] he himself has contributed to publications on Luis Barrag\u00e1n.\n Among Siza's earliest works to gain public attention was a public pool complex (named Piscinas de Mar\u00e9s) he created in the 1960s for Le\u00e7a da Palmeira, a fishing town and summer resort north of Porto. Completed in 1966, both of the two swimming pools (one for children, the other for adults) as well as the building with changing rooms and a cafe are set into the natural rock formation on the site with unobstructed views of the sea.[2] In 1977, following the revolution in Portugal, the city government of \u00c9vora commissioned Siza to plan a housing project in the rural outskirts of the town. It was to be one of several that he would do for SAAL (Servi\u00e7o de Apoio Ambulat\u00f3rio Local), the national housing association, consisting of 1,200 low-cost, housing units, some one-story and some two-story row houses, all with courtyards.[3] He was also a member of the team which reconstructed Chiado, the historic center of Lisbon destroyed by a fire in 1988.\n Most of his best known works are located in his hometown Porto: the Boa Nova Tea House (1963), the Faculty of Architecture (1987\u201393), and the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art (1997). Since the mid-1970s, Siza has been involved in numerous designs for public housing, public pools,[4] and universities. Between 1995 and 2009, Siza has been working on an architecture museum on Hombroich island, completed in collaboration with Rudolf Finsterwalder.[5] Most recently, he started coordinating the rehabilitation of the monuments and architectonic heritage of Cidade Velha (Old Village) in Santiago, an island of Cape Verde.\n Commissioned after winning an international competition in 2010, Siza and Granada-based Juan Domingo Santos unveiled designs for a new entrance and visitors center at the Alhambra in 2014.[6]\n By 2012, Siza warned that he might close his Portuguese office because of a lack of contracts.[7]\n In 2014, \u00c1lvaro Siza designed, with Carlos Castanheira the Building on the Water in Huai'An City, Jiangsu, China that was awarded the building of the year 2015 by ArchDaily.[8][9]\n In 2019, Alvaro Siza was commissioned with his first project in the United States, a 450-foot-tall, 37-story apartment building at 611 West 56th Street in Manhattan.[10]\n In 2020, \u00c1lvaro Siza designed four buildings respectively Siza House, YuChia House, Tea House and Gate House at the Taifong Golf Club, in Changhua, Taiwan.[11]\n Siza taught at FAUP from 1966 to 1969, returning in 1976. In addition to his teaching there, he has been a visiting professor at the Graduate School of Design, Harvard University; the University of Pennsylvania; Los Andes University of Bogota; and the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne.[3]\n In July 2014 Siza announced his decision to donate the large part of his architectural archive to the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in order to make his materials \"accessible alongside the work of other modern and contemporary architects\",[12] while also giving specific project archives to the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Gulbenkian in Lisbon and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Serralves in Porto, Portugal.[13]\n In 1987, the dean of Harvard Graduate School of Design, the Spanish architect Rafael Moneo, organized the first show of Siza's work in the United States.[14] In 1992, he was awarded with the renowned Pritzker Prize for the renovation project that he coordinated in the Chiado area of Lisbon, a historic commercial sector that was all but completely destroyed by fire in August 1988.[3]\n Other prizes include: The Golden Medal of The Superior Council of Architecture of the College of Architects of Madrid in 1988; Mies van der Rohe Award for European Architecture, the Prince of Wales Prize in Urban Design from Harvard University,[15] and the Alvar Aalto Medal in 1988; Portugal's National Prize of Architecture 1993; the Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize by the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the Praemium Imperiale in 1998, the Wolf Prize in Arts in 2001, the Urbanism Special Grand Prize of France 2005.\n Siza's Iber\u00ea Camargo Foundation in Porto Alegre, his first project built in Brazilian territory, was honoured by the Venice Architecture Biennale with the Golden Lion award in 2002.[16] In 2007 the Brazilian Government awarded him the Cultural Merit Order Medal. More recently he was awarded the RIBA's 2009 Royal Gold Medal[17] and the International Union of Architects' 2011 Gold Medal.[18] Siza was awarded by the Venice Architecture Biennale (13th Edition) with the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement (2012). In 2019 was awarded the National Architecture Award of Spain, being the first non-Spanish architect to receive it in its 90 years of history.[19]\n Siza was conferred the title of Honoris Causa Doctor by the following universities: Polytechnic University of Valencia; \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne; University of Palermo; University Menendez Pelayo, in Santander; Universidad Nacional de Ingenier\u00eda in Lima, Peru; University of Coimbra; Lus\u00edada University of Porto; Universidade Federal de Para\u00edba; the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Polo delle Scienze e delle Tecnologie, in Naples; the University of Architecture and Urbanism of Bucharest \"Ion Mincu\", Romania (2005); and the University of Pavia, Italy (2007). He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, the American Institute of Architects, the Acad\u00e9mie d'Architecture de France and the European Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n Works by Siza include the Iber\u00ea Camargo Foundation, the Serralves museum, and the New Orleans building.\n A monography of Siza appears in an early scene of the movie John Wick.[32][33]\n  Media related to \u00c1lvaro Siza Vieira at Wikimedia Commons\n ", "tags": ["Architecture educators", "Architecture writers", "1933 births", "Living people", "\u00c1lvaro Siza Vieira buildings", "Pritzker Architecture Prize winners", "Wolf Prize in Arts laureates", "Members of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts", "Recipients of the Praemium Imperiale", "Recipients of the Royal Gold Medal", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne faculty", "People from Matosinhos", "University of Porto alumni", "Modernist architects", "Postmodern architects", "20th-century Portuguese architects", "21st-century architects", "21st-century Portuguese people", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from September 2013", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Commons category link from Wikidata"], "raw": "Portuguese architect\n\n\n\u00c1lvaro Siza Vieira\u00c1lvaro Siza Vieira in 2012Born\u00c1lvaro Joaquim de Melo Siza Vieira25 June 1933\u00a0(1933-06-25) (age\u00a087)Matosinhos, PortugalNationalityPortugueseAlma\u00a0materUniversity of PortoOccupationArchitectAwardsPritzker Prize (1992), Royal Gold Medal (2009), UIA Gold Medal (2011), Golden Lion for lifetime achievement (2012), National Architecture Award of Spain (2019)BuildingsFaculty of Architecture, Porto\n\n \"Bonjour Tristesse\" apartments, Schlesische Stra\u00dfe, Berlin\n\u00c1lvaro Joaquim de Melo Siza Vieira GOSE GCIH GCIP (born 25 June 1933) is a Portuguese architect, and architectural educator.
