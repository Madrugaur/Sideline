{"name": "Klavdija Kutnar", "content": "Klavdija Kutnar is a Slovene mathematician. She received her PhD at the University of Primorska (UP) in 2008. She is Rector of the University of Primorska.\n Klavdija Kutnar was born 23 December 1980, in Ljubljana, Slovenia. She graduated from the Faculty of Education of the University of Ljubljana in 2003, and in 2008 received her PhD in Mathematics at the University of Primorska under the supervision of Dragan Maru\u0161i\u010d.[1] From 2010-2012 she was head of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Primorska Institute Andrej Maru\u0161i\u010d (UP IAM). In 2012, she was elected dean of the University of Primorska Faculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Information Technology (UP FAMNIT) and since 2015 has concurrently been assistant director of UP IAM. In 2018 she was granted the titles of Research Counsellor and Full Professor in Mathematics at the University of Primorska.[2] In 2019 she was elected the fourth rector of the University of Primorska.[3]\n Kutnar\u2019s main research area is algebraic graph theory. At the beginning of her research career, she also worked in mathematical chemistry. She is noted for her contribution to the study of the structural properties of particular families of symmetric graphs and in particular, her role in developing the original method of embedding graphs on surfaces to solve special cases of the well-known Lov\u00e1sz conjecture: the problem of finding Hamiltonian paths and cycles in vertex-transitive and Cayley graphs. She is a member of the research program P1-0285, financed by the Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS) and led by Prof. Dragan Maru\u0161i\u010d, PhD.[4] In 2018, she was the first Slovenian female mathematician to obtain a basic research project financed by the ARRS (J1-9110).[5]\n Kutnar has been a member of the editorial board of the journal Ars Mathematica Contemporanea since 2016, serving as editor-in-chief from 2018. She is also a member of the editorial boards of the Bulletin of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications and Algebraic Combinatorics, and managing editor of the scientific journal ADAM \u2013 The Art of Discrete and Applied Mathematics.\n She is a Deputy Chair of the Organizing Committee of the 8th European Congress of Mathematics in 2020 and a member of International Advisory Committee for the International Congress of Mathematicians 2022, which will take place in St. Petersburg, Russia.[6]\n She is a founding member and the secretary of the Slovenian Discrete and Applied Mathematics Society. Since 2017, she has been a member of the Council of the InnoRenew CoE (Center of Excellence for research and innovation in the field of renewable materials and a healthy living environment),[7] and the leader of the investment project \u201cRenewable Materials and Healthy Environments Research and Innovation Center of Excellence \u2013 InnoRenew CoE\u201d at UP FAMNIT.[8]\n In 2017, Kutnar was appointed by the Minister to the Working Group to support the Peer-Counseling Project on the financing of higher education in Slovenia. She is also a member of the Council of the Republic of Slovenia for prizes and awards for outstanding achievements in science, research and development.[9] \u00a0In 2019, she became the President of the Council of the Republic of Slovenia for Higher Education.[10]\n Klavdija Kutnar has a twin sister, Andreja, who received the 2018 Zois Award for important scientific achievements in the field of wood science, and is the director of the InnoRenew CoE.[11]\n ", "tags": ["1980 births", "Living people", "Slovenian mathematicians", "Women mathematicians", "Graph theorists", "CS1 Slovenian-language sources (sl)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Slovene mathematician\nKlavdija KutnarBorn (1980-12-23) December 23, 1980 (age\u00a040)Ljubljana, SloveniaNationalitySloveneAcademic backgroundAlma materUniversity of PrimorskaDoctoral advisorDragan Maru\u0161i\u010dAcademic workDisciplineMathematicianInstitutionsUniversity of PrimorskaMain interestsAlgebraic Graph Theory\n\nKlavdija Kutnar is a Slovene mathematician.
