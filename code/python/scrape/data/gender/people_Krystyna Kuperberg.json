{"name": "Krystyna Kuperberg", "content": "Krystyna M. Kuperberg (born Krystyna M. Trybulec; 17 July 1944) is a Polish-American mathematician who currently works as a professor of mathematics at Auburn University, where she was formerly an Alumni Professor of Mathematics.[1][2][3]\n Her parents, Jan W. and Barbara H. Trybulec, were pharmacists and owned a pharmacy in Tarn\u00f3w.  Her older brother is Andrzej Trybulec.  Her husband W\u0142odzimierz Kuperberg and her son Greg Kuperberg are also mathematicians,[2][3] while her daughter Anna Kuperberg is a photographer.[3][4]\n After attending high school in Gda\u0144sk, she entered the University of Warsaw in 1962, where she studied  mathematics.  Her first mathematics course was taught by Andrzej Mostowski; later she attended topology lectures of Karol Borsuk and became fascinated by topology.[2][3]\n After obtaining her undergraduate degree, Kuperberg began graduate studies at Warsaw under Borsuk, but stopped after earning a master's degree.[2][3]  She left Poland in 1969 with her young family to live in Sweden, then moved to the United States in 1972.[1][2][3] She finished her Ph.D. in 1974, from Rice University, under the supervision of William Jaco.[2][5][3] In the same year, both she and her husband were appointed to the faculty of Auburn University.[2][3]\n In 1987 she solved a problem of Bronis\u0142aw Knaster concerning bi-homogeneity of continua.[2][3] In the 1980s she became interested in fixed points and topological aspects of dynamical systems.  In 1989 Kuperberg and Coke Reed solved a problem posed by Stan Ulam in the Scottish Book.[6]   The solution to that problem led to her 1993 work in which she constructed a smooth counterexample to the Seifert conjecture.[1][2][3]  She has since continued to work in dynamical systems.[3]\n In 1995 Kuperberg received the Alfred Jurzykowski Prize from the Ko\u015bciuszko Foundation.[2][3] Her major lectures include an American Mathematical Society Plenary Lecture in March 1995, a Mathematical Association of America Plenary Lecture in January 1996, and an International Congress of Mathematicians invited talk in 1998.[1][7]  In 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[8]\n ", "tags": ["Polish emigrants to the United States", "American women mathematicians", "Polish women mathematicians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "20th-century Polish mathematicians", "21st-century Polish mathematicians", "Topologists", "1944 births", "Living people", "People from Tarn\u00f3w", "University of Warsaw alumni", "Rice University alumni", "Auburn University faculty", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Dynamical systems theorists", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Polish-American mathematician\nKrystyna M.
