{"name": "Johanna Piesch", "content": "Johanna (Hansi) Camilla Piesch (1898\u20131992) was an Austrian librarian, physicist and mathematician who is remembered for the pioneering contributions she made to switching algebra, one of the fundamentals of digital computing and programming languages.[1][2]\n Born on 6 June 1898 in Innsbruck, Johanna Camilla Piesch was the daughter of Oswald Piesch, a cavalry officer. She was brought up in Vienna where after primary school, she attended secondary school at the Reform Realgymnasium Dr Wesely, matriculating in 1916. She went on to study physics at the University of Vienna, earning a doctorate in 1921. In addition, she received a teaching qualification in mathematics and physics in 1928.[2]\n She joined the Post and Telegraph Service (Post- und Telegraphenverwaltung) in 1928 but had to take up early retirement in 1938 under the National Socialist regime. In July 1945, she was able to return to work, heading the PTT's laboratory. In February 1956, she moved to the library of the Technical University's documentation centre for technology and science. She retired in October 1962.[2]\n It appears that after leaving her post in 1938, Piesch was sent to Berlin where she began to work on switching algebra.
