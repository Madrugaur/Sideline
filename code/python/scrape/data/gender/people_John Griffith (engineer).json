He returned to Dublin in 1871 and worked as Dr. Stoney's assistant, becoming the Chief Engineer in 1898 before retiring in 1913.[2]\n He served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers in Ireland between 1887 and 1889 [3] and of the Institution of Civil Engineers between 1919 and 1920.[4] He was elected Commissioner of Irish Lights in 1913 and was a member of the Royal Commission on Canals and Waterways between 1906 and 1911.[2]\n Griffith purchased and drained the bogland at Pollagh, part of the Bog of Allen, a peat fuelled power station was built which drove an excavator, excess peat being taken by the Grand Canal for sale in Dublin.[5] The site was sold to the Turf Development Board in 1936 who used it as a basis for all of their later peat fuelled power stations, the area is now a nature reserve.[5]\n Griffith received a knighthood in 1911 and became vice-president of the Royal Dublin Society in 1922. He served as Honorary Professor of Harbour Engineering in Trinity College, his alma mater, and received an honorary M.A.I. degree from the University of Dublin in 1914.[2] From 1922 he was an elected member of the Seanad \u00c9ireann, the Irish senate, until its abolition in 1936.[6] In the 1930s he and Sarah Purser, endowed the Purser Griffith Travelling Scholarship and the Purser Griffith Prize to the two best performing students in European Art History at University College Dublin.[7]\n He died at Rathmines Castle in Dublin on 21 October 1938.[1]\n ", "tags": ["Irish civil engineers", "1848 births", "1938 deaths", "Irish knights", "Presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers", "Alumni of Trinity College Dublin", "Members of the 1922 Seanad", "Members of the 1925 Seanad", "Members of the 1928 Seanad", "Members of the 1931 Seanad", "Members of the 1934 Seanad", "Members of the Senate of Southern Ireland", "Independent members of Seanad \u00c9ireann", "EngvarB from April 2018", "Use dmy dates from April 2018", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DIB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nSir John GriffithSenatorIn office1922\u20131936\nPersonal detailsBorn5 October 1848Holyhead, WalesDied21 October 1938(1938-10-21) (aged\u00a090)Rathmines Castle, Dublin, IrelandNationalityIrishSpouse(s)Anna (Nina) PurserChildrenJohn GriffithAlice Elsie GriffithFrederick GriffithParentsReverend William GriffithAlice GriffithEducationTrinity College DublinOccupationCivil Engineer\nSir John Purser Griffith (5 October 1848 \u2013 21 October 1938) was a Welsh-born Irish civil engineer and politician.[1]\nGriffith was educated at Trinity College Dublin, and gained a licence in civil engineering in 1868.[2] He served a two-year apprenticeship under Dr Bindon Blood Stoney, the Engineer in Chief of the Dublin Port and Docks, before working as assistant to the county surveyor of County Antrim.
