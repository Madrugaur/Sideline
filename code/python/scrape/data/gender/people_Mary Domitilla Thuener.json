Her father was an immigrant from Germany who married an American; they had seven children but only three survived. Eleanor, the oldest, was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. She completed her studies at St. Mary\u2019s Academy in Monroe, Michigan in 1905, took orders as a Benedictine nun, and entered the St. Waldburg convent in Covington, Kentucky, taking the name Mary Domitilla. There she came to work as a teacher in two local Catholic schools.[1]\n By taking evening classes at St. Xavier College, Thuener completed a bachelor's degree in 1920. She completed a master's degree in 1923, in the women's college associated with the Catholic University of America.[1]\n In 1921, the Benedictines of Covington founded Villa Madonna College, later to become Thomas More College. Thuener became its first dean,[1][2] and also taught mathematics there. In 1929, she left for additional study at the Catholic University of America, completing a PhD in 1932. Her dissertation, supervised by Aubrey Edward Landry, was On the Number and Reality of the Self-Symmetric Quadrilaterals In-and-Circumscribed to the Triangular-Symmetric Rational Quartic. She then returned to Villa Madonna as a mathematics and physics instructor.[1]\n She served as prioress of St. Waldburg's beginning in 1943.[1][2]\n Thuener died on September 29, 1977.\n This article about an American mathematician is a stub.
