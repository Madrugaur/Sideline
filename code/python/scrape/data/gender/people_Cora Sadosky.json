{"name": "Cora Sadosky", "content": "Cora Susana Sadosky de Goldstein (May 23, 1940 \u2013 December 3, 2010) was a mathematician and Professor of Mathematics at Howard University.[1]\n Sadosky was born in Argentina, the daughter of mathematicians Manuel Sadosky and Corina Elo\u00edsa \"Cora\" Ratto de Sadosky. \n Sadosky began college at age 15 in the School of Science of the University of Buenos Aires.  In 1960 she earned her degree of Licenciada (comparable to a master's degree in the US nomenclature.)\nShe received an offer of a research assistantship to work on her doctorate in mathematics at the University of Chicago.  She earned her doctorate in 1965. \n After receiving her doctorate she returned to Argentina.  She became an assistant professor of Mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires. She resigned in 1966, along with 400 other faculty members, in protest over a police assault on the School of science. She taught for one semester at Uruguay National University and then became an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins. She returned to Argentina in 1968 but was unable to obtain an academic position there, and worked as a technical translator and editor.\n In 1974 she again fled Argentina; she relocated to Caracas and joined the faculty of the Central University of Venezuela. At this time she wrote a graduate text on mathematics that was published in the United States in 1979. She spent the academic year of 1978\u20131979 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1980 she became an associate professor at Howard University and was promoted to full professor in 1985.\n She was appointed a visiting professorship for women (VPW) in science and technology from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for 1983\u20131984 and spent it at the Institute for Advanced Study. She received a second VPW in 1995 which she spent as visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley. She received a Career Advancement Award  from the NSF in 1987\u20131988 which allowed her to spend the year as a member of the classical analysis program at Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MRSI), where she later returned as a research professor.\n She was elected president of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) for 1993\u20131995. The Sadosky Prize of the AWM is named in her honor.[2]\n Her research was in the field of analysis.\n ", "tags": ["1940 births", "Argentine mathematicians", "Argentine women mathematicians", "Mathematical analysts", "2010 deaths", "20th-century women scientists", "Technical translators", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Argentine mathematician\nNot to be confused with Cora Ratto de Sadosky.\nCora SadoskyBornCora Susana Sadosky(1940-05-23)May 23, 1940DiedDecember 3, 2010(2010-12-03) (aged\u00a070)NationalityArgentinianAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ChicagoSpouse(s)Daniel GoldsteinScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsHoward UniversityDoctoral advisorAlberto Calder\u00f3n\n\nCora Susana Sadosky de Goldstein (May 23, 1940 \u2013 December 3, 2010) was a mathematician and Professor of Mathematics at Howard University.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Awards\n4 Research\n5 References\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nSadosky was born in Argentina, the daughter of mathematicians Manuel Sadosky and Corina Elo\u00edsa \"Cora\" Ratto de Sadosky. \nSadosky began college at age 15 in the School of Science of the University of Buenos Aires.
