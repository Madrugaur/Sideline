{"name": "Charles Clagget", "content": "\n Charles Clagget [also spelled Claget, Claggett, Claggitt] (1740 \u2013 c.1795) was an Irish musician, composer, and inventor of improvements for musical instruments.\n Clagget was born in Waterford, Ireland, in 1740. He led theatre bands in Dublin (Smock Alley, 1762\u20134; Rotunda and Crow Street, 1763\u20137), Liverpool (1771\u20133), Manchester (1773\u20135) and Newry (1778\u20139). In 1776, he patented his earliest invention, a fingerboard for the violin and other stringed instruments, marked to show the position of tones and semitones, with movable nuts for changing keys without changing hand position.[2]\n In 1788, in patent declaration no. 1664, he patented:\n Clagget constructed a \"teliochordon\" stop for the royal harpsichord, which was delivered to Buckingham Palace on 17 December 1790. In the early 1790s his home in Greek Street, Soho, contained a musical museum, in which he exhibited and sold his inventions.[3]\n In about 1791 he exhibited his musical instruments at the Hanover Square Rooms. In the following year Joseph Haydn, who was then in London, called at Greek Street and examined Clagget's inventions, endorsing them in a letter which appeared in the Morning Herald of 27 April. On 31 October 1793 he gave an \"Attic Concert\" at the King's Arms, Cornhill, where he delivered a \"Discourse on Musick\", which was later published with a portrait of Clagget.[3]\n None of Clagget's inventions survived. \"(T)he lack of detailed explanation in the wording of his patent would make a modern reconstruction well-nigh impossible.\"[4] Yet, Clagget was the first inventor to both theorise and put into practice the principles of modern valved brass instruments.[5]\n Together with his brother Walter Clagget (1742\u20131798; a theatre musician in London) he published:\n ", "tags": ["1740 births", "1795 deaths", "18th-century classical composers", "18th-century male musicians", "18th-century Irish people", "Inventors of musical instruments", "Irish inventors", "Irish classical composers", "Irish male classical composers", "People from Waterford (city)", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from A Dictionary of Music and Musicians", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the ODNB", "Pages using cite ODNB with id parameter", "Articles incorporating Cite DNB template", "Use dmy dates from September 2019", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nIrish composer and instrument maker\n Portrait of Charles Clagget, published with his \"Discourse on Musick\".
