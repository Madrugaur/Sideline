{"name": "Joy Mukherjee", "content": "\n Joy Mukherjee (24 February 1939 \u2013 9 March 2012) was an Indian film actor and director.\n Joy Mukherjee was the son of Sashadhar Mukherjee and Sati Devi. His father was a successful producer and a co-founder of Filmalaya Studios. His uncles were director Subodh Mukherjee, Ashok Kumar, Anoop Kumar and Kishore Kumar. Joy Mukherjee was educated in Col. Brown Cambridge School in Dehra Dun and St. Xavier College. His wife's name is Neelam and they had two sons Monjoy (also known as Toy), Sujoy (also known as Boy) and a daughter Simran.[1]\n Joy debuted opposite Sadhana in the film Love in Simla (1960), directed by R. K. Nayyar. He then starred with Asha Parekh for several hits like Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon, Love in Tokyo, Ziddi and Hum Hindustani. Some of his films like Aao Pyar Karen and Shagird (opposite Saira Bano), Ek Musafir Ek Haseena with Sadhna, Ishaara with Vyjayantimala and Jee Chahta Hai with Rajashree were superhit movies. Most of his movies had hit music. By the late 1960s, acting roles began drying up, so he began directing and producing.[2]\n He produced and directed Humsaya although this films did not do well. Despite a late success with home production Ek Baar Muskura Do (1972) with brother Deb Mukherjee and later to be sister-in-law Tanuja, Joy faded from the silver screen.\n He later directed Rajesh Khanna in Chailla Babu in 1977 which was a major box office success. This film's success solved his insolvency problems which arose due to production of Love In Bombay. Later in 1985, Rajesh Khanna even gave him opportunity as a villain in the film Insaaf Main Karoonga, which became the last successful film of actor Joy Mukherjee.\n Love in Bombay brought deep financial troubles for Joy Mukherjee but late director-actor's wife Neelam, who is releasing the movie 40 years later, says that despite losing everything, the film remained very close to him. \"This film was my husband's Waterloo. He lost everything he had in this film. He sunk in lot of his own money, major properties. There were 37 cases of insolvency against him. But he cleared everything and had a clean slate and started afresh. This film was very dear to him despite it bringing so much problems to him,\" Mrs Mukherjee said. The 1973 film,  was the third part of the \"Love in\" series which started with Joy debuting with the blockbuster hit Love in Simla in 1960 and the golden jubilee hit Love in Tokyo in 1966. His insolvency issues got resolved when he directed his sole successful directorial venture Chailla Babu in 1977.\n Joy Mukherjee died on 9 March 2012 in Mumbai's Leelavati Hospital, exactly two weeks after his 73rd birthday, where he had been on a ventilator. He had a prolonged illness.[3]\n ", "tags": ["Indian male film actors", "Film directors from Mumbai", "Film producers from Mumbai", "People from Jhansi", "Bengali male actors", "1939 births", "2012 deaths", "Disease-related deaths in India", "20th-century Indian male actors", "Male actors in Hindi cinema", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from February 2016", "Use Indian English from February 2016", "All Wikipedia articles written in Indian English", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Indian film actor, director and producer\n\n\nJoy MukherjeeBorn(1939-02-24)24 February 1939Jhansi, United Provinces, British India (present-day Uttar Pradesh, India)Died9 March 2012(2012-03-09) (aged\u00a073)Mumbai, Maharashtra, IndiaNationalityIndianOccupationFilm actordirectorproducerYears\u00a0active1960\u20132012Height6\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in (188\u00a0cm)Spouse(s)Neelam MukherjeeChildren3Parent(s)Sashadhar Mukherjee (father)FamilyMukherjee-Samarth family and Ganguly family\nJoy Mukherjee (24 February 1939 \u2013 9 March 2012) was an Indian film actor and director.\n\nContents\n\n1 Family background\n2 Career\n3 Financial troubles\n4 Death\n5 Filmography\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nFamily background[edit]\nMain article: Mukherjee-Samarth family\nJoy Mukherjee was the son of Sashadhar Mukherjee and Sati Devi.
