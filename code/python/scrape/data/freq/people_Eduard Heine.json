{"name": "Eduard Heine", "content": "Heinrich Eduard Heine (16 March 1821 \u2013 October 1881) was a German mathematician.\n Heine became known for results on special functions and in real analysis. In particular, he authored an important treatise on spherical harmonics and Legendre functions (Handbuch der Kugelfunctionen). He also investigated basic hypergeometric series. He introduced the Mehler\u2013Heine formula.\n Heinrich Eduard Heine was born on 16 March 1821 in Berlin, as the eighth child of banker Karl Heine and his wife Henriette M\u00e4rtens. Eduard was initially home schooled, then studied at the Friedrichswerdersche Gymnasium and K\u00f6llnische Gymnasium in Berlin.[1] In 1838, after graduating from gymnasium, he enrolled at the University of Berlin, but transferred to the University of G\u00f6ttingen to attend the mathematics lectures of Carl Friedrich Gauss and Moritz Stern. In 1840 Heine returned to Berlin, where he studied mathematics under Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, while also attending classes of Jakob Steiner and Johann Franz Encke. In 1842 he was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Berlin for a thesis on differential equations submitted with Enno Dirksen and Martin Ohm as advisors. Heine dedicated the doctoral thesis to his professor Gustav Dirichlet. Next he went to the University of K\u00f6nigsberg to participate in the mathematical seminar of Carl Gustav Jacobi, while also following mathematical physics classes of Franz Ernst Neumann. In K\u00f6nigsberg Heine got in contact with fellow students Gustav Kirchhoff and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel.[2]\n In 1844 Heine went for a teaching position at the University of Bonn, passing his habilitation and starting as a privatdozent. He continued his research in mathematics in Bonn and, in 1848, was promoted to extraordinary professor. In 1850 he married Sophie Wolff, the daughter of a Berlin merchant; the couple had five children, four daughters and one son. In 1856 Heine moved as a full professor to the University of Halle, where he remained for the rest of his life. From 1864 to 1865, he served as a rector of the university. In 1875, the University of G\u00f6ttingen offered Heine a mathematics chair but he decided to reject the offer and remain in Halle. In 1877, at the centenary of Gauss' birth, he was awarded the Gauss Medal for his research.[2] Eduard Heine died on 21 October 1881 in Halle.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1821 births", "1881 deaths", "19th-century German mathematicians", "Mathematical analysts", "Scientists from Berlin", "K\u00f6llnisches Gymnasium alumni", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "Humboldt University of Berlin alumni", "University of K\u00f6nigsberg alumni", "University of Bonn faculty", "Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\nEduard HeineHeinrich Eduard HeineBorn(1821-03-16)16 March 1821Berlin, PrussiaDied21 October 1881(1881-10-21) (aged\u00a060)Halle, PrussiaNationalityGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of BerlinKnown\u00a0forUniform continuityAwardsGauss MedalScientific careerFieldsMathematicianInstitutionsUniversity of BonnUniversity of HalleDoctoral advisorEnno DirksenMartin OhmInfluencesPeter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet\n\nHeinrich Eduard Heine (16 March 1821 \u2013 October 1881) was a German mathematician.\nHeine became known for results on special functions and in real analysis.
