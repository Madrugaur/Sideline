From 1952 till 1967,\nhe was Professor at Voronezh State University. He then moved to Moscow as a Senior Scientific Fellow\n(1967\u201374) and then a Head of a Laboratory (1974\u201390) at the Institute of\nControl Sciences of the USSR Academy of Science in Moscow. From 1990, he worked \nat the Institute for Information Transmission Problems of the same Academy.\n When Mark was 18 he married Sarra Belotserkovskaya (10.09.1921\u201331.01.2009), they had 3 children (Veniamin, 1939; Alexandra (Alla), 1945; Alexander (Sasha), 1955). Now there are 7 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren.\n Mark Krasnosel'skii's has authored or co-authored some three hundred papers and fourteen\nmonographs. \nNonlinear techniques are roughly classified into analytical, \ntopological and variational methods. Mark Krasnosel'skii \nhas contributed to all three aspects in a\nsignificant way, as well as to their application to many types of integral,\ndifferential and functional equations coming from mechanics, engineering,\nand control theory.\n Mark Krasnosel'skii was the first to investigate the functional analytical\nproperties of fractional powers  of operators, at first for self-adjoint operators and then for more general situations.  His theorem on the interpolation of complete continuity of such fractional power operators has been  a basic tool in the theory of partial differential equations. Of comparable importance in applications is his extensive collection of works on the theory of positive operators, in particular results in which spectral gaps were estimated. His work on integral operators and superposition operators has also found many theoretical and practical applications. A major reason for this was  his desire to always find readily  verifiable conditions and estimates for whatever functional properties were under consideration. This is perhaps best seen in his work on topological methods in  nonlinear analysis which  he developed into a  universal method for finding  answers to such  qualitative problems such as  evaluating the number of solutions, describing the structure of a solution set and conditions for the  connectedness of this set, convergence of Galerkin type approximations, the bifurcation of solutions in nonlinear systems, and so on.\n Krasnosel'skii also presented many new general principles on solvability of a large variety of nonlinear equations, including  one-sided estimates, cone stretching and contractions, fixed-point theorems for monotone operators\nand a combination of the Schauder fixed point and contraction  mapping theorems that was the genesis of condensing operators. He suggested a new general method for investigating  degenerate extremals in variational problems and  developed qualitative methods for studying critical and bifurcation parameter values based on restricted information of nonlinear equations. such as the  properties of equations linearized at\nzero or at infinity, which have been very useful in determining the existence of bounded or periodic solutions.\n After he moved to Moscow he turned his attention increasingly to discontinuous processes and operators,  in\nconnection firstly with  nonlinear  control systems and then with a mathematically rigorous formulation of hysteresis which encompasses most classical models of hysteresis and is now standard. He also became actively involved with the analysis of desynchronized systems and the justification of the harmonic balance method commonly used by engineers.\n ", "tags": ["Soviet mathematicians", "Ukrainian mathematicians", "1920 births", "1997 deaths", "20th-century Russian mathematicians", "Ukrainian Jews", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " Commemorative plaque to Mark Alexandrovich Krasnosel'skii in  Voronezh\nMark Alexandrovich Krasnoselsky (Russian: \u041c\u0430\u0301\u0440\u043a \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439) (April 27, 1920, Starokostiantyniv \u2013 February 13, 1997, Moscow) was a Soviet, Russian and Ukrainian mathematician renowned for his work on nonlinear functional analysis and its applications.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early years\n1.2 Scientific career\n1.3 Family\n1.4 Distinctions\n\n\n2 Scientific achievements\n3 Selected works\n4 References\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nEarly years[edit]\nMark Krasnosel'skii was born in the town of\nStarokostiantyniv in Ukraine on the 27 April 1920  where his father worked as a\nconstruction engineer and his mother taught in an elementary school.\nIn 1932 the Krasnosel'skii family moved to Berdyansk and in 1938  Mark\nentered the physico-mathematical faculty of Kiev University, which  was\nevacuated  at the beginning of World War II  to Kazakhstan  where it\nbecame  known as the Joint Ukrainian University.\nHe graduated in 1942, in the middle of the war, served\nfour years in the Soviet Army, became Candidate in Science in 1948, with a\ndissertation on self-adjoint extensions of operators with nondense domains,\nbefore getting the title of Doctor in Science in 1950, with a thesis on\ninvestigations in Nonlinear Functional analysis.\n\nScientific career[edit]\nFrom 1946 till 1952, Mark was a Research Fellow at the Mathematical\nInstitute of the Ukrainian Academy of Science in Kiev.
