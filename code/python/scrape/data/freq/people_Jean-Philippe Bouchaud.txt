{"name": "Jean-Philippe Bouchaud", "content": "Jean-Philippe Bouchaud (born 1962) is a French physicist. He is founder  and Chairman of Capital Fund Management (CFM), professor of physics at \u00c9cole polytechnique and co-director of the CFM-Imperial Institute of Quantitative Finance at Imperial College London. He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences.\n Born in Paris in 1962, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud studied at the French Lyc\u00e9e in London. Graduated from \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in 1985, he worked on his PhD at the Laboratory of Hertzian Spectroscopy, studying spin-polarized quantum gases with Claire Lhuillier. He then worked for the French National Center for Scientific Research, in particular on liquid Helium 3 and diffusion in random media. He spent a year at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge in 1992 before joining the Laboratory of Condensed Matter Physics (SPEC)[1] of the French Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission (Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique or CEA)[2] \u00e0 Saclay. Pioneer in econophysics, he co-founded the company Science et Finance in 1994, which later merged with Capital Fund Management (CFM)[3] in 2000. He is now the Chairman of CFM. After teaching statistical mechanics for ten years at ESPCI, he was appointed in 2009 as an adjunct Professor at \u00c9cole Polytechnique,.[4] He now teaches a course From Statistical Mechanics to Social Sciences at \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. His work covers the physics of disordered and glassy systems, granular materials, the statistics of price formation, stock market fluctuations and the modelling of financial risks. He has repeatedly criticized the dogma of the efficient-market hypothesis and the methodology of economics and mathematical finance,[5] in particular the use of the Black\u2013Scholes model which leads to a systematic underestimation of risk in options trading.[6]\n ", "tags": ["1962 births", "Living people", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni", "French physicists", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from November 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Jean-Philippe BouchaudBorn1962ParisNationalityFrenchAlma\u00a0mater\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieureKnown\u00a0forPhysics of disordered systems, Quantitative modelling of financial markets, Agent Based ModelsAwardsCNRS Silver medalScientific careerFieldsPhysics, financeDoctoral advisorClaire LhuillierInfluencesPierre-Gilles De Gennes, Giorgio Parisi, Philip Anderson, Benoit Mandelbrot\n\nJean-Philippe Bouchaud (born 1962) is a French physicist.
