{"name": "Florentino P\u00e9rez", "content": "\n Florentino P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez (Spanish pronunciation:\u00a0[flo\u027een\u02c8tino \u02c8pe\u027ee\u00f0 ro\u02c8\u00f0\u027ei\u0263e\u03b8]; born 8 March 1947) is a Spanish businessman, civil engineer, former politician, and the current President of Real Madrid, as well as Chairman and CEO of Grupo ACS, a civil engineering company.\n P\u00e9rez attended the Polytechnic University of Madrid.[4]\n P\u00e9rez joined the Union of the Democratic Centre party in 1979, serving among others on the Madrid city council.[5]\n In 1986, P\u00e9rez ran in the Spanish general elections as candidate for the Partido Reformista Democr\u00e1tico (Democratic Reformist Party) and served as its secretary-general.[4]\n In 1993, he was named vice president of OCP Construcciones. After the fusion of OCP with Gines y Navarro into Actividades de Construcci\u00f3n y Servicios, S.A. (ACS) in 1997, he became president of the new company.\n As of 2018 he leads Grupo ACS,[6] Spain's largest construction company, and has a net worth of $2.3b.[7]\n P\u00e9rez's second attempt was more successful; he took over as President of Real Madrid in 2000, beating the current president at that time, Lorenzo Sanz. Sanz assumed that the recently won UEFA Champions Leagues in 1998 and 2000 would give him enough credit to win the elections, but P\u00e9rez's campaign, once again highlighting the financial problems of the club and claims of mismanagement by the previous boards, proved otherwise. P\u00e9rez's promise to bring in Lu\u00eds Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona also played a decisive role in the elections. P\u00e9rez was reelected in 2004 with 94.2% of the total votes.\n Figo also marked the start of P\u00e9rez's policy to bring one of the best football players in the world to Real Madrid each season. The strategy was initially known as that of Zidanes y Pavones \u2013 in which superstars would play alongside the Canteranos, but the players were soon popularly referred to as Gal\u00e1cticos. In 2001, Zinedine Zidane was signed from Juventus for a then-world record transfer fee of \u20ac77.5\u00a0million. He was followed by Ronaldo in 2002, David Beckham in 2003, Michael Owen in 2004 and Robinho for a short time in 2005. Initially, P\u00e9rez's policy worked to great success, as each new Gal\u00e1ctico had the squad built around them, and the team had a good balance between attack and defence. In his first years in office, Real Madrid won two Spanish championships and its record ninth UEFA Champions League.\n P\u00e9rez claimed success in clearing the club's debt; however, this was contradicted by director Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n.\n Several years after leaving Real, Fernando Hierro stated that Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 had been the club's most important and least appreciated midfielder, saying, \"The loss of Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was the beginning of the end for Los Gal\u00e1cticos... You can see that it was also the beginning of a new dawn for Chelsea.\"[8]}} From the 2003\u201304 season onward, with the absence of manager Vicente del Bosque and Makelele, Real Madrid failed to win a trophy.\n Though P\u00e9rez's policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being focused too much on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the football. He announced his resignation on 27 February 2006, acknowledging that the team and the club as a whole needed a new direction.[9]\n On 14 May 2009, P\u00e9rez announced his candidacy for president of Real Madrid in a press conference at the Hotel Ritz Madrid.[10] On 1 June 2009, given that he was the only candidate able to provide the \u20ac57,389,000 guarantee necessary to run for the presidency, P\u00e9rez was announced as the new president of Real Madrid.[11][12]\n In his second term, P\u00e9rez continued with the Gal\u00e1cticos policy pursued during his first term. On 8 June 2009, he bought Kak\u00e1 from Milan for just under \u00a360\u00a0million,[13] while on 11 June, Manchester United accepted an \u00a380\u00a0million offer for Cristiano Ronaldo, which would once again break the world record. On 25 June, P\u00e9rez and Real Madrid announced the signing of Valencia centre-back Ra\u00fal Albiol for \u20ac15\u00a0million.[14] On 1 July, P\u00e9rez bought Karim Benzema from Olympique Lyonnais for a fee of at least \u00a330\u00a0million, which could rise to \u00a335\u00a0million, depending on the player's success.\n On 5 August 2009, Real Madrid confirmed the signing of Xabi Alonso from Liverpool[15] for \u00a330\u00a0million; Alonso became the second Liverpool player to join Real Madrid in the same transfer window after full-back \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa's \u00a35\u00a0million switch to the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in July.\n On 31 May 2010, P\u00e9rez presented Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as the new manager of Real Madrid in a \u00a36.8\u00a0million deal.\n During the next three years, P\u00e9rez brought a lot of new faces to the team, including the German wonderkid Mesut \u00d6zil, and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, who both attracted attention from Europe's elite football clubs during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. This squad enjoyed its share of domestic success in 2011 and 2012, with the club bringing home a Copa del Rey title and the Spanish League title.[16][17] However, the club's lack of success in European competition and a disappointing 2012\u201313 season[18] encouraged Mourinho to depart for his former club Chelsea.[19]\n On 2 June 2013, P\u00e9rez was awarded a fourth term as the Real Madrid president, bringing in Carlo Ancelotti to replace Mourinho. Mesut \u00d6zil and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn were sold to Arsenal[20] and Napoli,[21] respectively, at the start of the season to secure spots for Luka Modri\u0107 and Karim Benzema in the first team. P\u00e9rez also brought in Welsh footballer and PFA Player of the Year[22] Gareth Bale, purchased from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee reported to be in the \u00a386\u00a0million range, yet again breaking the world record.[23] Two promising Spanish talents, playmaker Isco[24] and holding midfielder Asier Illarramendi,[25] were also secured by P\u00e9rez prior to the start of the season. The following season proved to be a resounding success, as Real Madrid won the Copa del Rey and its tenth Champions League title.\n During the 2014 summer transfer window, P\u00e9rez brought in 2014 FIFA World Cup stars James Rodr\u00edguez,[26] Toni Kroos,[27] and Keylor Navas[28] to Real Madrid for a combined cost of \u00a395\u00a0million, as well as Javier Hern\u00e1ndez on a loan deal from Manchester United. As a result of the mounting competition for starting spots and wage disputes, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda left the club for Manchester United for a British record transfer fee of \u00a360\u00a0million.[29] Xabi Alonso also left during this transfer window to join Bayern Munich.[30] In January 2015, P\u00e9rez demonstrated his success in the transfer market when Real Madrid signed the 16-year-old Norwegian Martin \u00d8degaard in competition with many of the big clubs in Europe, including Bayern, Barcelona and Arsenal.[citation needed]\n During COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, he got infected by the COVID-19 on 2 February 2021, but he had no symptoms.[31]\n ", "tags": ["1947 births", "Living people", "Businesspeople from Madrid", "Spanish billionaires", "Polytechnic University of Madrid alumni", "Madrid city councillors (1979\u20131983)", "Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain) politicians", "Real Madrid CF presidents", "Spanish civil engineers", "20th-century Spanish businesspeople", "21st-century Spanish businesspeople", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from October 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Use dmy dates from July 2020", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from June 2017", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "In this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  P\u00e9rez and the second or maternal family name is  Rodr\u00edguez.\n\n\nFlorentino P\u00e9rezP\u00e9rez in 201615th and 18th President of Real MadridIncumbentAssumed office 1 June 2009Preceded byVicente BoludaIn office16 July 2000\u00a0\u2013 27 February 2006Preceded byLorenzo SanzSucceeded byFernando Mart\u00edn \u00c1lvarez (unofficial)  Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n\nBornFlorentino P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez (1947-03-08) 8 March 1947 (age\u00a074)Hortaleza, Madrid, SpainNationalitySpanishAlma\u00a0materTechnical University of MadridOccupationCivil engineerKnown\u00a0forPresident of Real Madrid and Grupo ACSNet\u00a0worthUS$2.3\u00a0billion (February 2019)[1]Board member\u00a0ofChairman of Grupo ACSSpouse(s)Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngeles \"Pitina\" Sandoval Montero (died 22 May 2012)[2]RelativesEduardo P\u00e9rez del Barrio (father)Soledad Rodr\u00edguez P\u00e9rez (mother)[3]\nFlorentino P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez (Spanish pronunciation:\u00a0[flo\u027een\u02c8tino \u02c8pe\u027ee\u00f0 ro\u02c8\u00f0\u027ei\u0263e\u03b8]; born 8 March 1947) is a Spanish businessman, civil engineer, former politician, and the current President of Real Madrid, as well as Chairman and CEO of Grupo ACS, a civil engineering company.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early career\n2 Real Madrid presidency\n\n2.1 First term\n2.2 Second term\n\n\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nEarly career[edit]\nP\u00e9rez attended the Polytechnic University of Madrid.[4]\nP\u00e9rez joined the Union of the Democratic Centre party in 1979, serving among others on the Madrid city council.[5]\nIn 1986, P\u00e9rez ran in the Spanish general elections as candidate for the Partido Reformista Democr\u00e1tico (Democratic Reformist Party) and served as its secretary-general.[4]\nIn 1993, he was named vice president of OCP Construcciones.
