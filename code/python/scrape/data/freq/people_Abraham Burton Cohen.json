Cohen was an active member of the American Concrete Institute and earned ACI's Wason Medal for Most Meritorious Paper in 1927.[1]\n Cohen was Jewish,[2] born in Chicago and died in East Orange, New Jersey.

As a consulting engineer, he designed a number of concrete spans in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Binghamton, New York, and elsewhere.
