{"name": "Norman Abramson", "content": "Norman Manuel Abramson (April 1, 1932[1] \u2013 December 1, 2020) was an American engineer and computer scientist, most known for developing the ALOHAnet system for wireless computer communication.\n Abramson was born on April 1, 1932 in Boston, Massachusetts, to immigrant Jewish parents Edward and Esther. His father was born in Lithuania, and worked in commercial photography. His mother was born in Ukraine, and managed the house.[2]\n He was schooled in the Boston public schools and attended Boston Latin School and the English High School of Boston.[2] He showed good aptitude in math and science, and he received an A.B. in physics from Harvard University (1953),  an M.A. in Physics from UCLA (1955), and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University (1958).[1] His thesis at Stanford focused on the area of communication theory.[2]\n Abramson was a research engineer at the Hughes Aircraft Company until 1955, when he joined the faculty at Stanford University (1955\u201365), was visiting professor at University of California at Berkeley (1966), before moving to University of Hawaii (1968\u201394), serving as professor of both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.[1][2] Some of his early research concerned radar signal characteristics and sampling theory,\nas well as frequency modulation and digital communication channels, error correcting codes,[3]\npattern recognition and machine learning and computing for seismic analysis.[1]\n One of Abramson's first projects at the University of Hawaii was to develop radio technology to help the school send and receive data from its remote geographic location to the continental United States, funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency. A key innovation in the technology was to divide the data in packets which could be resent if the data was lost during transmission, allowing for random access rather than sequential access, based on the same principles being developed for ARPAnet, the precursor of the modern Internet. The resulting radio network technology his team developed was deployed as ALOHAnet in 1971, based on the dual-meaning of the Hawaiian word \"aloha\".[2] ALOHAnet became the foundation of modern wireless communication as well as influencing the development of Ethernet-based communications.[2]\n Abramson continued to serve as a professor at Hawaii until 1994 when he retired.[2] Abramson went on to co-found Aloha Networks in San Francisco, where he served as a CTO.\n Abramson had two children with his wife, Joan: a son, Mark, and a daughter, Cairn; she predeceased him by six years.[2]\n Abramson died on December 1, 2020 in his San Francisco home due to complications from skin cancer that had metastasized to his lungs.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1932 births", "2020 deaths", "American electrical engineers", "American computer scientists", "American information theorists", "Jewish American scientists", "Harvard University alumni", "University of California, Los Angeles alumni", "University of Hawaii faculty", "Stanford University School of Engineering alumni", "Writers from Boston", "Fellow Members of the IEEE", "Mathematicians from Massachusetts", "American chief technology officers", "Deaths from skin cancer", "Deaths from cancer in California", "Articles with short description", "Articles with short description added by PearBOT 5", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American engineer and computer scientist\nThis article is about the computer scientist and electrical engineer.
