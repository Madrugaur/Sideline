{"name": "Henry Beachell", "content": "Henry Monroe \"Hank\" Beachell (September 21, 1906 \u2013 December 13, 2006) was an American plant breeder. His research led to the development of hybrid rice cultivars that saved millions of people around the world from starvation.\n Born in Waverly, Nebraska, Beachell and his family moved to a corn and wheat farm in western Nebraska. In 1930 he earned a bachelor's degegree in agronomy from the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln, where he was a member of the FarmHouse fraternity.[2] After obtaining a Master's degree at Kansas State University, Beachell worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Texas. There, he created nine rice varieties, which eventually accounted for more than 90 percent of the U.S. long-grain rice production.\n Beachell has been called the most important person in rice improvement in the world.[3] As farmers planted higher yielding rice, nutrition improved in many Asian countries, and farmers increased their incomes. Beachell was awarded a honorary doctorate from the University of Nebraska in 1972.[4] Beachell has received many international awards, including the 1987 Japan Prize and 1996 World Food Prize. As a centenarian, Beachell consulted with RiceTec, the only commercial hybrid rice-breeding program in the U.S, up until his death.\n ", "tags": ["1906 births", "2006 deaths", "American biologists", "American centenarians", "People from Lancaster County, Nebraska", "University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln alumni", "Kansas State University alumni", "20th-century biologists", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Henry BeachellBorn(1906-09-21)September 21, 1906Waverly, Nebraska, U.S.DiedDecember 13, 2006(2006-12-13) (aged\u00a0100)Pearland, Texas, U.S.Alma\u00a0materUniversity of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln (B.S. 1930)Kansas State University (M.S. 1933)AwardsWorld Food PrizeJapan Prize[1]Scientific careerFieldsPlant breedingThesisThe inheritance of resistance to leaf rust and bunt, and of other characters in the wheat cross, Tenmarq X Minturki\u00a0(1933)Academic advisorsJohn H.
