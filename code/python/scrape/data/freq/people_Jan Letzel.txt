In 1901 he won a scholarship to study architecture at the School of Applied Arts in Prague, where he studied for three years under Jan Kot\u011bra, one of the founders of modern Czech architecture. In 1902 and 1903 he undertook study tours in Bohemia, Dalmatia, Montenegro, and Herzegovina. From June 1904 to August 1905 he worked at architectural firm Quido B\u011blsk\u00fd in Prague. At the same time he designed and built a sanatorium and a pavilion in the Art Nouveau style in M\u0161en\u00e9-l\u00e1zn\u011b. In October 1905 he received his mediation and worked in Cairo for a while. In the spring of 1907 he went back to Prague after visiting Rome, Milan, Venice, and other Italian cities.

In the next few years he designed about 40 buildings, including the French school, Sacre Coeur in Tokyo, the Jesuit College, the German embassy, and several hotels and office buildings. His most famous design was the huge administrative building of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Hiroshima, now the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. Hiroshima at that time was dominated by two-story wooden buildings, and the Promotional Hall, with its large size soon became one of Hiroshima's most striking landmarks. It became famous after surviving the atomic attack on the city in 1945.  It was rededicated, still as a ruin, as the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, otherwise known as the A-Bomb Dome.

In March 1920 he returned home, but went back to Japan few months later for his attach\u00e9 post.\n In November 1922, Letzel traveled to Japan and later witnessed the destruction of many of his buildings in the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake.
