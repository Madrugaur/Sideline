{"name": "Claire Desch\u00eanes", "content": "Claire Desch\u00eanes CM (born 1954) is a Canadian mechanical engineer, an engineering professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering Universit\u00e9 Laval, and a member of the Order of Canada. She is the first female professor of engineering at the Faculty of Science and Engineering at Laval University, and is an expert in hydraulic turbine technology, hydrodynamics, and fluid mechanics.[1][2]\n While she was in a CEGEP program, Desch\u00eanes' father passed away and her mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.[2] Desch\u00eanes completed two years of CEGEP in psychology, before taking a year off to take care of her mother, and then completed a CEGEP year in the mathematics, physics, and biology stream.[2] Later on, she pursued mechanical engineering during her undergraduate degree, and cites her reasons for going into science to include the desire to have a stable career as she may have to help her siblings one day.[2]\n Desch\u00eanes was the only woman in her undergraduate program, and went on to do a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Universit\u00e9 Laval.[2][3] Upon receiving a scholarship to study abroad, Desch\u00eanes pursued a PhD at the Institut National Politechnique de Grenoble in France, where she studied computational fluid dynamics in hydraulic turbines, and completed her degree in January 1990 before returning to her Universit\u00e9 Laval to become the first female professor of engineering at the Faculty of Science and Engineering.[1][2]\n Desch\u00eanes founded the Laboratoire de Machines Hydrauliques (LAMH) in 1989, which is a centre for hydraulic turbines research.[2][3] In 2007, Desch\u00eanes created the Consortium en machines hydrauliques, which is an academic-industry collaboration, including Hydro Qu\u00e9bec and Natural Resources Canada, to carry out research on high-power hydraulic turbines.[2][3][4] Desch\u00eanes and the Consortium have received support from industry and federal grants (including those from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and NSERC Collaborative Research and Development grants) to purchase equipment and carry out collaborative research, such as analysing 3D turbine flow patterns with computer simulations, and investigating factors which influence durability of low-head turbines.[2][3][4] Desch\u00eanes' findings have led to a better understanding of turbines and hydro-electric technology.[2][4]\n Between 1997 and 2006, Desch\u00eanes served as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and Alcan International Limited Chair for Women in Science and Engineering at Universit\u00e9 Laval.[2][5] She has co-founded three non-profit organizations to support and promote women in science and engineering: the International Network for Women Engineers and Scientists (INWES), the Association de la francophonie \u00e0 propos des femmes en sciences, technologies, ing\u00e9nierie et math\u00e9matiques (AFFESTIM), and the INWES Educational and Research Institute (ERI).[2]\n Desch\u00eanes has received multiple honours and awards. Of note, in 2015, Desch\u00eanes received the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council's Synergy Award for Innovation, in the partnership category, in recognition of her effective collaborations between industry and academia.[3][6] She is a fellow of Engineers Canada (2015), and been named a Le Soleil and Radio-Canada laureate twice (in the science and research category).[2] She was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Ottawa in 2016.[2]\n On 27 June 2019, Desch\u00eanes was appointed a member of the Order of Canada for her \"contributions to mechanical engineering research and teaching, and for championing women in science and engineering.\"[7][8]\n On September 21, 2019, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke.\n ", "tags": ["1954 births", "Living people", "21st-century women engineers", "Members of the Order of Canada", "21st-century Canadian engineers", "Canadian engineering researchers", "Canadian mechanical engineers", "Canadian women engineers", "Universit\u00e9 Laval alumni", "Universit\u00e9 Laval faculty", "Grenoble Institute of Technology alumni", "20th-century Canadian engineers", "Canadian expatriates in France", "20th-century women engineers", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with infoboxes completely from Wikidata", "Articles using Template Infobox person Wikidata", "Pages using Template:Post-nominals with missing parameters", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Canadian engineer\nClaire Desch\u00eanesBornShawinigan\u00a0Alma\u00a0materGrenoble Institute of TechnologyUniversit\u00e9 Laval\u00a0EmployerHydro-Qu\u00e9bec (1977\u20131979)\u00a0AwardsPrix Lionel-Boulet (2020)Order of Canada (2019)honorary doctor of the University of Sherbrooke (2019)Honorary doctor of the University of Ottawa (2016)Synergy Awards for Innovation (2014)\u00a0\nClaire Desch\u00eanes CM (born 1954) is a Canadian mechanical engineer, an engineering professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering Universit\u00e9 Laval, and a member of the Order of Canada.
