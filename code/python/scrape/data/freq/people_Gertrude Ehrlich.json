She is a professor emerita of mathematics at the University of Maryland, College Park.[1]\n Ehrlich was born on January 7, 1923 in Vienna,[2] the daughter of Jewish lawyer Josef Ehrlich and his wife Charlotte, n\u00e9e Kobak.[3] In the late 1930s, she became a student at the Chajes Gymnasium, a special high school in Vienna for Jewish honor students; her classmates included future Nobel laureate Walter Kohn and mathematicians Rodolfo Permutti and Karl Greger.[4] She was able to escape Nazi-occupied Austria in 1939, traveling with her mother, her older sister Margarete Ehrlich (a philosophy student and later radiographer) and aunt Mathilde Ehrlich (a painter) to the US on the SS Statendam in July 1939; her father rejoined them a year later. They lived for the next several years with her uncle Benedict Kobak in Atlanta.[3] She became a US citizen in 1945.[5]\n She graduated from the Georgia State College for Women in 1943, and earned a master's degree from the University of North Carolina in 1945.[2] She completed her Ph.D. in 1953 at the University of Tennessee. Her dissertation, The Structure of Continuous Rings, was supervised by Wallace Givens.[6][7]\n Ehrlich is the author of the book Fundamental Concepts of Abstract Algebra (PWS-Kent Publishing, 1991; Dover, 2011).[8] She is the coauthor of The Structure of the Real Number System (with Leon Warren Cohen, D.
