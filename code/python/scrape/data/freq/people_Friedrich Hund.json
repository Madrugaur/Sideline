{"name": "Friedrich Hund", "content": "Friedrich Hermann Hund (4 February 1896 \u2013 31 March 1997) was a German physicist from Karlsruhe known for his work on atoms and molecules.[1]\n Hund worked at the Universities of  Rostock, Leipzig, Jena, Frankfurt am Main, and G\u00f6ttingen.\n Hund worked with such prestigious physicists as Schr\u00f6dinger, Dirac, Heisenberg, Max Born, and Walter Bothe. At that time, he was Born's assistant, working with quantum interpretation of band spectra of diatomic molecules.\n After his studies of mathematics, physics, and geography in Marburg and G\u00f6ttingen, he worked as a private lecturer for theoretical physics in G\u00f6ttingen (1925), professor in Rostock (1927), Leipzig University (1929), Jena (1946), Frankfurt/Main (1951) and from 1957 again in G\u00f6ttingen. Additionally, he stayed in Copenhagen (1926) with Niels Bohr and lectured on the atom at Harvard University (1928). He published more than 250 papers and essays in total. Hund made pivotal contributions to quantum theory - especially concerning the structure of the atom and of molecular spectra.\n In fact, Robert S. Mulliken, who was awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize in chemistry for molecular orbital theory, always proclaimed the great influence Hund's work had on his own and that he would have gladly shared the Nobel prize with Hund. In recognition of the importance of Hund's contributions, MO theory is often referred to as the Hund-Mulliken MO theory. Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity is another eponym and, in 1926, Hund discovered the so-called tunnel effect or quantum tunnelling.\n The Hund's cases, which are particular regimes in diatomic molecular angular momentum coupling, and Hund's rules, which govern atomic electron configurations, are important in spectroscopy and quantum chemistry. In chemistry, the first rule, Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity, is especially important and is often referred to as simply Hund's Rule.\n On the occasion of his 100th birthday, the book: Friedrich Hund: Geschichte der physikalischen Begriffe [History of Physical Concepts] (Heidelberg, Berlin, Oxford), Spektrum, Akademie Verlag 1996, ISBN\u00a03-8274-0083-X was published. A review was also written by Werner Kutzelnigg.[2]\n In addition to the many honors bestowed upon him, Friedrich Hund became an honorary citizen of Jena/Saale, and a street in Jena was named after him. In June 2004, a part of a new building of the Physics Department in G\u00f6ttingen was given the address Friedrich-Hund-Platz 1. The same name was chosen for the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.\n Friedrich Hund is buried in Munich Waldfriedhof. He was a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science. His son is chess player and mathematician Gerhard Hund.\n ", "tags": ["1896 births", "1997 deaths", "Commanders Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "German centenarians", "German physicists", "International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science members", "People from the Grand Duchy of Baden", "People from Karlsruhe", "University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty", "University of Jena alumni", "Leipzig University alumni", "University of Rostock alumni", "Winners of the Max Planck Medal", "Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin", "Burials at Munich Waldfriedhof", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Friedrich HundFriedrich Hund, G\u00f6ttingen, in the 1920sBorn4 February 1896\u00a0(1896-02-04)KarlsruheDied31 March 1997\u00a0(1997-04-01) (aged 101)G\u00f6ttingenNationalityGermanAwardsMax Planck Medal (1943) Otto Hahn Prize for Chemistry and Physics (1974)Scientific careerFieldsPhysicsDoctoral advisorMax BornDoctoral studentsHarry LehmannCarl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4ckerJ\u00fcrgen SchnakenbergEdward Teller\n\nFriedrich Hermann Hund (4 February 1896 \u2013 31 March 1997) was a German physicist from Karlsruhe known for his work on atoms and molecules.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Publications\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nHund worked at the Universities of  Rostock, Leipzig, Jena, Frankfurt am Main, and G\u00f6ttingen.\nHund worked with such prestigious physicists as Schr\u00f6dinger, Dirac, Heisenberg, Max Born, and Walter Bothe.
