She attended St Paul's Girls' School and the Perse School for Girls.[1] In 1942, she won a scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge, becoming a wrangler in 1945.[2]\n She won a Newnham research fellowship in 1948,[3] and received her Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge in 1951. Her dissertation, The Finite Primitive Collineation Groups which contain Homologies of Period Two,\nconcerned the group-theoretic properties of collineations, geometric transformations preserving straight lines;[4]\nshe also published this material in three journal papers. J. A. Todd, who supervised her research work, observed that \"the detailed results contained in her papers\" were \"of permanent value\".[3]\n After completing her doctorate, Hamill was appointed to a lectureship in the University of Sheffield.
