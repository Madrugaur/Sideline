Kondratiev is a member of the Kyiv school of functional analysis founded by M. Krein and lead, for many years, by Y. Berezansky.\nHis interests in mathematical physics were inspired by cooperation with the Moscow seminar in statistical Physics (R. Dobrushin, R. Minlos, Y. Sinai). Yuri's collaboration with A. Skorokhod has influenced most of his subsequent papers on stochastics.\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Work\n3 Selected articles\n4 References\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nIn 1975, Yuri Kondratiev graduated with honours from Kyiv University.\nIn 1979 he completed his PhD with thesis entitled \u201cGeneralized functions in problems of infinite dimensional analysis\u201d at the Kyiv University.\nIn 1987 Yuri obtained the Degree of Doctor of Science in the area \"Spectral Analysis of Infinite Dimensional Elliptic Differential Operators\u201d.\nSince 1991 Yuri has worked in Ukraine (Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, National Pedagogical Dragomanov University) as well as in Germany (University of Bonn, Bielefeld University) and the UK (University of Reading).  Since 2008 he holds a full Professor position at the Bielefeld University.\nWork[edit]\nHe has written a book entitled \"Spectral Methods in Infinite Dimensional Analysis\" 1, 2 (1988, with Y. Berezansky, in Russian; translated into English in 1995).\nHe co-authored a monograph \"The Statistical Mechanics of Quantum Lattice Systems\" (with S. Albeverio, Y. Kozitsky and M. R\u00f6ckner).\nTogether with S. Albeverio and M. R\u00f6ckner Yuri initiated a systematical study of Continuous Configuration Spaces. One space of stochastic distributions is named after him (\u00abKondratiev space\u00bb).\nSelected articles[edit]\nAnalysis and geometry on configuration spaces (with S. Albeverio and M.
