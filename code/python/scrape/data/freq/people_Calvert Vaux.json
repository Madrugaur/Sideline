{"name": "Calvert Vaux", "content": "Calvert Vaux (/v\u0254\u02d0ks/; December 20, 1824 \u2013 November 19, 1895) was a British architect and landscape designer, best known as the co-designer, along with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and junior partner Frederick Law Olmsted, of what would become New York City's Central Park.\n Vaux, on his own and in various partnerships, designed and created dozens of parks across the United States. He introduced new ideas about the significance of public parks in America during a hectic time of urbanization. This industrialization of the cityscape inspired Vaux to focus on an integration of buildings, bridges, and other forms of architecture into their natural surroundings. He favored naturalistic, rustic and curvilinear lines in his designs.\n Born in London to a physician, Vaux was baptized at St Benet Gracechurch on February 9, 1825. He trained as an apprentice under the architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham, a leader of the Gothic Revival movement. Vaux trained under Cottingham until the age of twenty-six.\n In 1851, Vaux exhibited a series of watercolor landscapes that he made while en route to the United States that caught the attention of Andrew Jackson Downing, a noted landscape architect. Downing traveled to London in search of an architect, who would complement his architectural vision. He believed that architecture should be visually integrated into the surrounding landscape, and wanted to work with someone who was equally passionate. Vaux accepted the opportunity and subsequently moved to the United States.\n Vaux worked with Downing for two years and became a firm partner. Together, they designed many projects such as the White House grounds and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Vaux's work on the Smithsonian inspired him to write an article in 1852 for The Horticulturalist, of which Downing was the editor. In his publication, he argued that the government should recognize and support the arts. Shortly afterward, Downing died in a steamboat accident.\n After Downing's death, Vaux gained control of the firm. As a partner, he hired Frederick Clarke Withers, who was already working at the company.[1] The business lasted four years and their projects included the Jefferson Market Library and the Rice Building, although the Rice project has been attributed in other scholarship to George B. Post.\n In 1856, he gained U.S. citizenship and became identified with New York City's artistic community, \u201cthe guild,\u201d joining the National Academy of Design, as well as the Century Club. In 1857, he became one of the founding members of the American Institute of Architects. Also in 1857, Vaux published Villas and Cottages, which was an influential pattern book that determined the standards for \u201cVictorian Gothic\u201d architecture. These particular writings revealed his acknowledgment and tribute to Ruskin and Ralph Waldo Emerson, as well as to his former partner Downing. These people, among others, influenced him intellectually and in his design path.\n In 1857, Vaux recruited Frederick Law Olmsted, who had never before designed a landscape plan, to help with the Greensward Plan, which would become New York City's Central Park. They obtained the commission through the Greensward Plan, an excellent presentation that drew upon Vaux's talents in landscape drawing to include before-and-after sketches of the site. Together, they fought many political battles to make sure their original design remained intact and was carried out. All of the built features of Central Park were of his design; Bethesda Terrace is a good example.\n In 1865, Vaux and Olmsted founded Olmsted, Vaux and Company, which went on to design Prospect Park and Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, and Morningside Park in Manhattan. In Chicago, they planned one of the first suburbs, called the Riverside Improvement Company in 1868. They also were commissioned to design a major park project in Buffalo, New York, which included The Parade (now Martin Luther King, Jr. Park), The Park (now the Delaware Park), and The Front (now simply Front Park). Vaux designed many structures to beautify the parks, but most of these have been demolished. Vaux also designed a large Canadian city park in the city of Saint John, New Brunswick called Rockwood Park. It is one of the largest of its kind in Canada. In 1871, the partners designed the grounds of the New York State Hospital for the Insane in Buffalo and the Hudson River State Hospital for the Insane in Poughkeepsie.\n In 1872, Vaux dissolved the partnership and went on to form an architectural partnership with George K. Radford and Samuel Parsons. In that same year he worked on Olana, the home of artist Frederic Edwin Church, who collaborated with Vaux on the mansion's design.[2]\n He returned to working with Olmsted in 1889 for one last collaboration: designing the City of Newburgh's Downing Park as a memorial to their mentor.\n Other famous New York City buildings Vaux designed are the Jefferson Market Courthouse, the Samuel J. Tilden House, and the original Ruskinian Gothic buildings, now largely invisible from exterior view, of the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In addition to the New York buildings, Vaux also was the designing architect for The Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital in Towson, Maryland.\n Less familiar are twelve projects Vaux designed for the Children's Aid Society in partnership with Radford; the Fourteenth Ward Industrial School (1889), 256-58 Mott Street, facing the churchyard of St. Patrick's Old Cathedral,[3] and the Elizabeth Home for Girls (1892), 307 East 12th Street, both survive and are landmarked.[4]\n On November 19, 1895, Vaux accidentally drowned in Gravesend Bay in Brooklyn while visiting his son, Downing. He is buried in Kingston, New York's Montrepose Cemetery. In 1998, the city of New York dedicated Calvert Vaux Park, situated in Gravesend overlooking the bay, to him.[5]\n In 1854, Vaux married Mary Swan McEntee, the sister of Jervis McEntee, a Hudson River School painter. They had two sons (Calvert and Downing) and two daughters (Helen and Julia).\n \n\n ", "tags": ["1824 births", "1895 deaths", "Architects from New York City", "American landscape and garden designers", "American landscape architects", "Central Park", "British emigrants to the United States", "People from Kingston, New York", "Architects from London", "Deaths by drowning", "Accidental deaths in New York (state)", "Burials at Montrepose Cemetery", "Fellows of the American Institute of Architects", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Structurae ID not in Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Calvert VauxBorn(1824-12-20)December 20, 1824London, EnglandDiedNovember 19, 1895(1895-11-19) (aged\u00a070)Brooklyn, New York, United StatesNationalityEnglish-AmericanOccupationArchitectSpouse(s)Mary Swan McEnteeChildrenCalvertDowningHelenJuliaProjectsCentral Park, Prospect Park\n\nCalvert Vaux (/v\u0254\u02d0ks/; December 20, 1824 \u2013 November 19, 1895) was a British architect and landscape designer, best known as the co-designer, along with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and junior partner Frederick Law Olmsted, of what would become New York City's Central Park.\nVaux, on his own and in various partnerships, designed and created dozens of parks across the United States.
