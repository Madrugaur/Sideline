M\u00f8ller, was a Danish architect, professor and, from 1965 to 1969, the first rector of the Aarhus School of Architecture. His former practice, Arkitektfirmaet C. F. M\u00f8ller, which he founded in 1924, still exists and bears his name. It is today the largest architectural firm in Denmark with branch offices in several countries.[1]\n Christian Frederik M\u00f8ller was born in Skanderborg, Denmark. He was the son of Valdemar M\u00f8ller and Nielssine Dalby.\n He first trained as a mason and later studied architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, graduating in 1920.\nHe conducted study trips to England (1925); Germany, Italy and France (1927); Germany, Switzerland and Italy (1937). He exhibited at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition during 1952\u201364, 1973, 1978, 1985.\n[2]\n He set up his own architectural office C.F. M\u00f8ller in 1924, and in 1928 formed a partnership with the architect and Professor Kay Fisker (1893\u20131965) which lasted until 1942. After winning first prizes in the competitions for Aarhus Community Hospital in 1930 and Aarhus University in 1931, they established an office in Aarhus in 1932. Their buildings also include the apartment blocks 2 Vodroffsvej (1930) and Vesters\u00f8hus (1935\u201339) in Copenhagen, the latter of which has remained a major influence on Danish housing architecture.[3]\n[4]\n Their winning proposal for Aarhus University consisted of individual faculty buildings arranged along the margin of an undulating park setting. The first building at the site was completed in 1933. By the early 40s, the collaboration with Fisker had ended and C. F. M\u00f8ller was left to complete the Aarhus University alone. M\u00f8ller was present at the construction site when the British Royal Air Force bombed the University dormitories, which were occupied by the Gestapo, on 31 October 1944. During the attack, a bomb accidentally struck the main building, and M\u00f8ller was lightly injured as a result, while about ten members of the construction crew were killed. The main building was completed in 1946 and the so-called Book Tower in 1962.\nLater works include Salling Department Store im Aarhus (1949, with Gunnar Krohn), Anglig\u00e5rden (1965, later Herning Art Museum) and Eget\u00e6pper in Herning (1984).\nM\u00f8ller was Royal Building Inspector from 1953 to 1968, and in 1965 he became the first rector of the newly founded Aarhus School of Architecture.\n[5]\n In 1928, he married Bodil Marie Jacobsen (1904-1996).\nHe died in Aarhus at 90 years of age and  was buried at Vestre Kirkeg\u00e5rd in Aarhus.\n Main Building (1946)\n Main Building, brick colonnades\n Auditorium, Main Building\n The Book Tower of the State Library (1960\u201363)\n The Book Tower\n Typical facade\n Typical facade (1974)\n Details of an underground pathway (1946)\n Stairway detail\n Arhus Community Hospital\n Functionalist apartments at Vesters\u00f8hus in Copenhagen\n Vodroffsvej in Copenhagen, typical Danish funkis architecture\n Nils-Ole Lund  (1998) Bygmesteren C.F.
