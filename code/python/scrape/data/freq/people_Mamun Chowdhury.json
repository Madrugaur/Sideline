Having completed his education in Bangladesh, after a short period in the Middle East, Mamun arrived in[1][2] London[3] in December 1991.[1][2] From 1993 to 2013, he lived in Poplar, Tower Hamlets[4] before moving to Redbridge.\n In 1994, Chowdhury began his career in the United Kingdom establishing London Clothing Limited, importing ready-made garments from Bangladesh and selling to clients in the UK and rest of Europe. This was supported by setting up his own factory to manufacture garments in the UK.[1][2][3]\n In 1996, he changed his business model and focused only on high-end outerwear and worked with some of UK's top designers.[1][2] He concentrated on making British traditional outerwear, including duffle coats.[3] In 1998, his business was large enough to provide opportunities for fashion students to gain work experience.[1][2]\n Chowdhury used his designing skills to design and develop his own range. In January 2001, he set up London Tradition with Rob Huson, a city fashion Executive,[2] designing and manufacturing luxury duffle coats.[5] The company now exports 40,000 to 50,000 coats a year, 90% of its output, and has seen overseas sales rise by 865% between 2007 and 2013.[3] In July 2014, the company was awarded a Queen's Award for Enterprise for International Trade in recognition of its business performance.[6] Chowdhury was invited to meet with Queen Elizabeth II at a Buckingham Palace reception party.\n \n This article about a British businessperson born in the 1960s is a stub.
