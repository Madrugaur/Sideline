He was also a fitter and turner apprentice. Booth is widely credited for inventing starting blocks for sprinting races, along with his father.[1]\n When he first used his invention in a race, made from a T-bar and a block of wood cut in half, he was disqualified for life.  The decision was overturned a few weeks later.[2]\n At age 100, Booth gave a rare interview about his long and successful life.[3]\n In 2006, the then 102-year-old wanted to run in a special Stawell Gift over-40s race, with the prize being a pig, but in the end he decided against it.[1]\n In 2007, he celebrated his 104th birthday with a small private party.[4] Nearly eight months later in May 2008, Booth died at the age of 104.\n \n This biographical article relating to Australian athletics is a stub.
