Hawkins", "content": "Jane Margaret Hawkins is an American mathematician who works as a professor of mathematics at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.[1] Her research concerns dynamical systems and complex dynamics, including cellular automata and Julia sets. More recent research has included work on cellular automata models for the spread of HIV, Hepatitis C and Ebola.[2]\n Hawkins earned a B.A. in mathematics from the College of the Holy Cross, a Jesuit college in Worcester, Massachusetts,[1] and received a Marshall Scholarship for graduate studies in the U.K.  She then moved to England for graduate studies, receiving her Ph.D. from University of Warwick in 1981 under the supervision of Klaus Schmidt.
