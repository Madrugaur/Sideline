His research interests involve the intersection of complex variables, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. He has resolved various conjectures by applying estimates of the complex Neumann problem and the theory of multiplier ideal sheaves to algebraic geometry.[1][2]\n Siu obtained his BA in mathematics from the University of Hong Kong in 1963, his M.A. from the University of Minnesota, and his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1966.[3]\nSiu completed his doctoral dissertation, titled \"Coherent Noether-Lasker decomposition of subsheaves and sheaf cohomology\", under the supervision of Robert C. Gunning.[4] Before joining Harvard, he taught at Purdue University, the University of Notre Dame, Yale, and Stanford. In 1982 he joined Harvard as a Professor, of Mathematics. He previously served as the Chairman of the Harvard Math Department.[5]\n In 2006, Siu published a proof of the finite generation of the pluricanonical ring.[6]\n In 1993, Siu received the Stefan Bergman Prize[7] of the American Mathematical Society. He has holds honorary doctorates from the University of Hong Kong, University of Bochum, Germany, and University of Macau.
