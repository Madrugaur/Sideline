{"name": "Olaf Nordhagen", "content": "Johan Olaf Brochmann Nordhagen (16 March 1883 \u2013 6 November 1925) was a Norwegian educator, architect, engineer and artist. He is most commonly associated with his restoration designs for Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, Norway.[1][2]\n Olaf Nordhagen was born in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. He was a son of  painter and artist Johan Nordhagen (1856\u20131956) and Christine Magdalene Brochmann Johansen (1858\u20131933). He was a brother of botanist Rolf Nordhagen and through him an uncle of  art historian Per Jonas Nordhagen. In April 1909 in \u00c5dal he married Thora Hval (1887\u20131960).[3]\n[4]\n Nordhagen was educated as an engineer at Christiania tekniske skole in Oslo and worked as an apprentice to architect Bredo Greve for several years before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Art while also assisting Martin Nyrop with his designs for Copenhagen City Hall.  Nordhagen returned to Oslo in 1906 and accepted a number of smaller commissions. His breakthrough, however, came when he won the competition to build the Bergen Public Library (Bergen Offentlige Bibliotek) in Art Nouveau (Jugendstil), for which he also won the  Houen Fund prize (Houens fonds premie).[5]\n[6]\n Nordhagen designed a number of industrial structures including transformer stations and power plants, including S\u00e5heim Hydroelectric Power Station in Rjukan (with Thorvald Astrup). He also designed several churches and completed considerable research around Norwegian traditional architecture. Dating from 1913,  he was also a professor at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim.[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n Following the death in 1906 of architect Christian Christie, Nordhagen took over the restoration designs of the Nidaros Cathedral, which he continued until his own death in 1925. His tendency to reinterpret Gothic designs rather than seek a faithful reproduction of the original was controversial at the time but was carried out.[10]\n S\u00e5heim power plant\n Vemork power station\n Glomfjord power plant\n Follafoss power plant\n Category:Norwegian University of Science and Technology faculty\n ", "tags": ["1883 births", "1925 deaths", "Norwegian architects", "Norwegian engineers", "Norwegian artists", "Norwegian male artists", "Norwegian educators", "Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts alumni", "Art Nouveau architects", "20th-century engineers", "CS1 Norwegian-language sources (no)", "CS1 Danish-language sources (da)", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": " Olaf Nordhagen\n Plan  for restoration of Nidaros Cathedral, drawn by Olaf Nordhagen (1914)\nJohan Olaf Brochmann Nordhagen (16 March 1883 \u2013 6 November 1925) was a Norwegian educator, architect, engineer and artist.
