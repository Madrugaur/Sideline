She has been conferred the title of Raja Permaisuri (Queen consort) of Perak by the Dewan Negara Perak on 20 June 2014.\n A chemical engineer by training, she was heading an oil and gas consultancy firm based in Kuala Lumpur before her marriage to the Sultan. She and the Sultan, who had been the country\u2019s most eligible royal bachelor for decades, have known each other since the mid-1990s. She was officially crowned as the Raja Permaisuri of Perak during Sultan Nazrin's enthronement ceremony as the 35th Sultan of Perak on 6 May 2015.\n Born in the city of Ipoh on 22 March 1973, she is the youngest of four children of William Stanley Walker Davidson (Salim Davidson), an Englishman and his ethnic Malay wife of mixed Arab and Thai descent, Sharifah Azaliah Syed Omar Shahabudin who is from Alor Setar, Kedah. She is also a distant member of Kedah Royal Family on her maternal side and has three elder brothers.

She was also part of the Petronas project team to operationalise the largest single-train low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plant in the world at Kertih.\n Zara left Petronas in November 2001 to become an account manager at Formis Network Services Sdn Bhd and then assumed the post of vice-president of partnerships and alliances at Formis (Malaysia) Berhad, a technology-based company listed on Bursa Malaysia, between 2003 and 2005.\n Between 2005 and 2007, Zara, who is a certified life-saver and adventure sports enthusiast, became the managing director of Forthwave Consulting Sdn Bhd, a hydrocarbon technical engineering and software development company in Kuala Lumpur.\n Zara Salim Davidson is the great-grandchild of Kedah's 24th ruler Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah, Utusan Malaysia reported.\n The Sultan ruled Kedah for 62 years from 1881 to 1943 and one of the Sultan's sons was Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's first prime minister. Therefore, she is also the grandniece of the Tunku and a niece of Sultan Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah and of the current sultan, Sultan Sallehuddin.\n According to Zara's uncle Syed Mohd Aldinuri Syed Omar, Zara's mother Sharifah Azaliah Syed Omar was the daughter of Tunku Aminah, who was the daughter of Sultan Abdul Hamid and Che Manjalara.\n From the marriage to Che Manjalara, Sultan Abdul Hamid had seven children, including Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj and Tunku Aminah.\n Zara also has a close relationship with the late Sultan of Kedah, Sultan Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah Sultan Badlishah, who is the grandson of Sultan Abdul Hamid and a nephew to Tunku Abdul Rahman.\n She is also the granddaughter of the former Kedah Menteri Besar Tan Sri Syed Omar Syed Abdullah Shahabudin. Tunku Aminah married Syed Omar, who became Kedah's second Menteri Besar after independence, from July 1959 to December 1967.\n Zara's wedding to Raja Nazrin Shah was held at Istana Iskandariah on 17 May 2007.\n A day after the solemnisation of their vows, there was a special proclamation ceremony to bestow Zara with the official title of Raja Puan Besar of Perak, a title reserved for the royal wife of the Raja Muda (Crown Prince) of Perak that had been vacant since April 1987.\n The royal wedding reception took place on 19 May 2007.\n The couple's first child, a son named Raja Azlan Muzzaffar Shah, was born 14 March 2008.
