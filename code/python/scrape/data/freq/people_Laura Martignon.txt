{"name": "Laura Martignon", "content": "Laura Martignon (born 1952)[1] is a Colombian and Italian professor and scientist. Since 2003 she serves as a Professor of Mathematics and Mathematical Education at the Ludwigsburg University of Education and was until 2017 an Adjunct Scientist of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, where she previously worked as Senior Researcher. She also worked for ten years as a Mathematics Professor at the University of Brasilia and spent a period of one and a half years at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a Research Grant of the Israeli Government.\n Martignon obtained a Bachelor Degree in Mathematics at Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Bogot\u00e0 in 1971, a Master's Degree in Mathematics in 1975, and then graduated as a Doctor. rer. nat.  in Mathematics at the University of T\u00fcbingen in 1978.  She obtained her \"emquadramento\" (tenure) at the University of Brasilia in 1984 and her German Habilitation in Neuroinformatics at the University of Ulm, Germany, in 1998.\n Martignon specialized in Mathematics Education and, as an applied mathematician, in Mathematical Modeling collaborating  in interdisciplinary scientific contexts. Together with physicist Thomas Seligman she applied functional analysis determining criteria for the applicability of integral transforms in n-body reaction calculations [2] and constructing Hilbert Spaces for the embedding of observables and of density matrices.[3] In Neuroinformatics she modeled synchronization in the spiking events of groups of neurons: With her colleagues from Neuroscience G\u00fcnther Palm, Sonja Gr\u00fcn, Ad Aertsen, Hermann von Hasseln, Gustavo Deco and the statistician Kathryn Laskey she set the basis for valid measurements of higher oder synchronizations.[4] [5]\n Her recent contributions have been in Probabilistic Reasoning, Decision Making and their connections with Mathematics Education. In 1995 she was one of the founding members of the ABC Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition, directed by Gerd Gigerenzer first in Munich (1995\u20131997) at the Max Planck Institute for Psychlogical Research and then in Berlin at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development ( since 1997). With colleagues from  ABC, mainly with Ulrich Hoffrage, she modeled the take-the-best heuristic as a non-compensatory linear model for comparison providing a first partial characterization of its ecological rationality [MH]. She is best known for having conceptualized and defined Fast-And-Frugal trees for classification and decision, mainly with Konstantinos Katsikopoulos and Jan Woike,[MKW] [WHM] proving their fundamental properties, creating a theoretical bridge from natural frequencies [6] to fast and frugal heuristics for classification and decision. \n Today her work on reasoning motivates most of her research in Mathematics Education. With Stefan Krauss, Rolf Biehler, Joachim Engel, Christoph Wassner and Sebastian Kuntze she has propagated the tenets of the ABC Group on the advantages of natural information formats and decision heuristics in school and as a topic of Math Education[MK].  She is now collaborating with Keith Stenning,  studying probability-free judgement based on defeasible logics and its impact for Mathematics Education [SMV]. She has also done research on Gender in Mathematics Education leading a project on the topic at her University and founding the review journal Mathematik und Gender.[7] For a period of 6 years she was the representative of the Working Group Frauen und Mathematik of the German Society of Mathematics Education (GDM) [2].\n ", "tags": ["1952 births", "Living people", "Colombian mathematicians", "Italian mathematicians", "Women mathematicians", "University of Bras\u00edlia", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty", "National University of Colombia alumni", "University of T\u00fcbingen alumni", "Ludwigsburg University of Education faculty", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Semantic Scholar author identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Colombian and Italian mathematician; lives in Germany\nLaura MartignonProfessor Laura MartignonBorn1952\u00a0(1952)Bogot\u00e0, ColombiaNationalityItalian and ColombianAlma\u00a0materUniversity of T\u00fcbingenAwardsGleichstellungs-Preis 2008, Ludwigsburg UniversityScientific careerFieldsMathematics,          =Mathematics Education, Mathematical Modeling, Gender and Mathematics Education Decision MakingInstitutionsLudwigsburg University of Education\n\nLaura Martignon (born 1952)[1] is a Colombian and Italian professor and scientist.
