{"name": "Fumihiko Maki", "content": "Fumihiko Maki (\u69c7 \u6587\u5f66, Maki Fumihiko, born September 6, 1928) is a Japanese architect who teaches at Keio University SFC. In 1993, he received the Pritzker Prize for his work, which often explores pioneering uses of new materials and fuses the cultures of east and west.[1]\n Maki was born in Tokyo. After studying at the University of Tokyo, graduating in 1952, he moved to the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, graduating with a master's degree in 1953. He then studied at Harvard Graduate School of Design, graduating with a Master of Architecture degree in 1954.\n In 1956, he took a post as assistant professor of architecture at Washington University in St. Louis, where he also was awarded his first commission: the design of Steinberg Hall (an art center) on the university's Danforth Campus. This building remained his only completed work in the United States until 1993, when he completed the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts building in San Francisco.[2] In 2006, he returned to Washington University in St. Louis to design the new home for the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum and Walker Hall.\n In 1960 he returned to Japan to help establish the Metabolism Group. He worked for Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in New York City and for Sert Jackson and Associates in Cambridge, Massachusetts and founded Maki and Associates in 1965.\n In 2006, he was invited to join the judging panel for an international design competition for the new Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. Maki designed an extension building for the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which was completed in 2009.[3]\n After completing a $330 million expansion of the headquarters of the United Nations in Manhattan, Maki designed Tower 4 at the former World Trade Center site which opened in 2013. While it has criticized his 51 Astor Place project as \"out of place,\" New York magazine called Tower 4 \"pretty exquisite.\"[4]\n Maki will be designing the London campus of the Aga Khan University along with a cultural centre as part of the King's Cross development project. These will be Maki's first European projects and represent the third and fourth Aga Khan projects for Maki, who also designed the Delegation of the Ismaili Imamat in Ottawa and Aga Khan Museum in Toronto.[5] He was also assigned by the Sonja & Reinhard Ernst Stiftung to design the Museum Reinhard Ernst in Wiesbaden, Germany, to display the foundations\u2019 collection of abstract art.[1]\n Maki is known for fusing modernism with Japanese architectural traditions.[6] For instance, he introduced the concept of oku, which is a spatial layout unique to Japan in which spaces wind around a structure.[7][8] This is demonstrated in the use of walls and landscape in the Shimane Museum of Ancient Izumo.[9]\n Maki's other notable projects include the following:\n Tsuda Hall, Tokyo (1988)\n Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, Sendagaya Tokyo (1990)\n Nakatsu Obata Commemoration Library, Nakatsu \u014cita Japan (1993)\n Kaze-no-Oka Crematorium (1997)\n Hillside West (1998)\n TV Asahi Headquarters, Tokyo (2003)\n Yokohama Island Tower, Yokohama (2003)\n The National Institute for Japanese Language, Tokyo (2005)\n Shimane Museum of Ancient Izumo, Shimane Japan\n MIT Media Lab Extension, Cambridge, Massachusetts (2009)[3]\n Aga Khan Museum, Toronto (2014)\n ", "tags": ["Fumihiko Maki buildings", "1928 births", "Living people", "People from Tokyo", "20th-century Japanese architects", "Modernist architects", "Cranbrook Academy of Art alumni", "Members of the Acad\u00e9mie d'architecture", "Harvard Graduate School of Design alumni", "University of Tokyo alumni", "Washington University in St. Louis faculty", "Keio University faculty", "Pritzker Architecture Prize winners", "Wolf Prize in Arts laureates", "Recipients of the Praemium Imperiale", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters", "Articles with short description", "Articles with short description added by PearBOT 5", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Japanese-language text", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Japanese architect\nFumihiko MakiMaki at the MIT Media Lab in March 2010Born (1928-09-06) September 6, 1928 (age\u00a092)Tokyo, JapanNationalityJapaneseAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Tokyo (Bachelor of Architecture, 1952)Cranbrook Academy of Art (Master of Architecture, 1953)Graduate School of Design, Harvard University (Master of Architecture, 1954)OccupationArchitectAwardsPritzker PrizeAIA Gold MedalPracticeMaki and AssociatesBuildingsYerba Buena Center for the Arts, Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, 4 World Trade CenterProjectsExpansion of the headquarters of the United Nations in Manhattan.\nWebsitewww.maki-and-associates.co.jp\nFumihiko Maki (\u69c7 \u6587\u5f66, Maki Fumihiko, born September 6, 1928) is a Japanese architect who teaches at Keio University SFC.
