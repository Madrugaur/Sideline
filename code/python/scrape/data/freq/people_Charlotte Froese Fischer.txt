{"name": "Charlotte Froese Fischer", "content": "Charlotte Froese Fischer (born 1929) is a Canadian-American applied mathematician and computer scientist noted for the development and implementation of the Multi-Configurational Hartree\u2013Fock (MCHF) approach to atomic-structure calculations and its application to the description of atomic structure and spectra. \n The experimental discovery of the negative ion of calcium\n[1] \nwas motivated by her theoretical prediction of its existence.[2]\nThis was the first known anion of a  Group 2 element.[3][4] \nIts discovery was cited in Froese Fischer's election to  Fellow of the American Physical Society.\n \n Charlotte Froese was born on September 21, 1929, in the village of Pravdivka (formerly Nikolayevka[5]), in the  Donetsk region, in the present-day Ukraine, to parents of Mennonite descent. Her parents immigrated to Germany in 1929 on the last train allowed to cross the border before its closure by Soviet authorities. After a few months in a refugee camp, her family was allowed to immigrate to Canada, where they eventually established themselves in Chilliwack, British Columbia.\n She obtained both a B.A. degree, with honors, in Mathematics and Chemistry and an M.A. degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of British Columbia in 1952 and 1954, respectively. She then obtained her Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Computing at Cambridge University in 1957, pursuing coursework in quantum theory with Paul Dirac. She worked under the supervision of Douglas Hartree, whom she assisted in programming the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) for atomic-structure calculations.\n \nShe served on the mathematics faculty of the University of British Columbia from 1957 till 1968, where she introduced numerical analysis and computer courses into the curriculum and was instrumental in the formation of the Computer Science Department. Froese Fischer spent 1963-64 at the Harvard College Observatory, where she extended her research on atomic-structure calculations. While at Harvard, she was the first woman scientist to be awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship. In 1991 she became a Fellow of the American Physical Society, in part for her contribution to the discovery of negative calcium. In 1995 she was elected a member of the Royal Physiographic Society in Lund, in 2004 a foreign member of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, and in 2015 she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Technology from Malm\u00f6 University, Sweden.\n Froese Fischer is the author of over 300 research articles on computational atomic theory, many of which have had far-reaching impact in the area of atomic-structure calculations. The early version of the MCHF program, published in the first volume of Computer Physics Communications received two Citation Classics Awards in 1987. She authored an influential monograph on Hartree-Fock approaches to the first-principles calculation of atomic structure, [6] \nand coauthored a substantial successor work. [7]    \nOne of her largest efforts in the field is the calculation of the complete lower spectra of the beryllium-like to argon-like isoelectronic sequences, amounting to the publication of data covering 400 journal pages and a total of over 150 ions.\n[8]\n[9] She also authored a scientific biography of her Ph.D. thesis advisor, Douglas Hartree.[10]\n Froese Fischer is currently an emerita research professor of computer science at Vanderbilt University and a Guest Scientist in the Atomic Spectroscopy Group at NIST. She is the widow of Patrick C. Fischer, himself a noted computer scientist and former professor at Vanderbilt.[11] An autobiographical account of her own life up to the year 2000 was published in Molecular Physics,[12]\nand a biographical review of her scientific work up to 2019 has been published in Atoms.[13]\n \n ", "tags": ["1929 births", "Living people", "Canadian women mathematicians", "Fellows of the American Physical Society", "Members of the Royal Physiographic Society in Lund", "Canadian women computer scientists", "Canadian women physicists", "Canadian women chemists", "Canadian Mennonites", "20th-century American women scientists", "Theoretical chemists", "Academics in British Columbia", "University of British Columbia Faculty of Science alumni", "University of British Columbia Faculty of Science faculty", "Harvard University faculty", "Vanderbilt University faculty", "Canadian expatriate academics in the United States", "Computational chemists", "Sloan Research Fellows", "People from Chilliwack", "Harvard College Observatory people", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Place of birth missing (living people)"], "raw": "Canadian-American applied mathematician and computer scientist\nCharlotte Froese FischerAlma\u00a0materUniversity of British ColumbiaUniversity of CambridgeAwardsSloan Research Fellowship Fellow of the American Physical SocietyMember, Royal Physiographic Society in LundFulbright Senior Research AwardForeign Member, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences  Honorary Doctorate, Malm\u00f6 University  Fellow of the Royal Society of CanadaHonorary Doctorate,  Western UniversityScientific careerInstitutionsUniversity of British ColumbiaHarvard College ObservatoryVanderbilt UniversityNational Institute of Standards and TechnologyDoctoral advisorDouglas Hartree\n\nCharlotte Froese Fischer (born 1929) is a Canadian-American applied mathematician and computer scientist noted for the development and implementation of the Multi-Configurational Hartree\u2013Fock (MCHF) approach to atomic-structure calculations and its application to the description of atomic structure and spectra. \nThe experimental discovery of the negative ion of calcium\n[1] \nwas motivated by her theoretical prediction of its existence.[2]\nThis was the first known anion of a  Group 2 element.[3][4] \nIts discovery was cited in Froese Fischer's election to  Fellow of the American Physical Society.\n\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Education and research\n3 Contributions\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nCharlotte Froese was born on September 21, 1929, in the village of Pravdivka (formerly Nikolayevka[5]), in the  Donetsk region, in the present-day Ukraine, to parents of Mennonite descent.
