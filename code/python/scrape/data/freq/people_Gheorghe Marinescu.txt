{"name": "Gheorghe Marinescu", "content": "Gheorghe Marinescu (Romanian:\u00a0[\u02c8\u0261e\u032for\u0261e mari\u02c8nesku]; 28 February 1863 \u2013 15 May 1938) was a Romanian neurologist, founder of the Romanian School of Neurology.\n After attending the Faculty of Medicine of Bucharest University, Marinescu received most of his medical education as preparator at the laboratory of histology at the Br\u00e2ncoveanu Hospital and as assistant at the Bacteriological Institute under Victor Babe\u015f, who had already published several works on myelitis transversa, hysterical muteness, and dilatation of the pupil in pneumonia.\n After qualification, and on the recommendation of Babe\u015f, the government awarded Marinescu a grant to undertake postgraduate training in neurology under Jean-Martin Charcot at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital in Paris, where he met Pierre Marie, Joseph Babinski and Fulgence Raymond. Later, he worked with Carl Weigert in Frankfurt and then with Emil du Bois-Reymond in Berlin. On the assignment of Pierre Marie, he lectured on the pathological anatomy of acromegaly at the Berlin International Congress in 1890.\n After nine years abroad, Marinescu returned in 1897 to Bucharest, where he received his doctorate and began a new professorial department at Pantelimon Hospital which had been created for him. Shortly thereafter, in 1897, a chair of Clinical Neurology was created at the University of Bucharest, in Colentina Hospital. He remained in this post for the next 41 years and is regarded as the founder of the Romanian School of Neurology.[citation needed] He was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1905.[1]\n Between July 1898 and 1901, Marinescu made the first science films in the world in his clinic in Bucharest:[2] The walking troubles of organic hemiplegy (1898), The walking troubles of organic paraplegies (1899), A case of hysteric hemiplegy healed through hypnosis (1899), The walking troubles of progressive locomotion ataxy (1900) and Illnesses of the muscles (1901). All these short subjects have been preserved. The professor called his works \"studies with the help of the cinematograph\", and published the results, along with several consecutive frames, in issues of the magazine La Semaine M\u00e9dicale from Paris, between 1899 and 1902.[3] In 1924, Auguste Lumi\u00e8re recognized the priority of professor Marinescu concerning the first science films: \"I've seen your scientific reports about the usage of cinematograph in studies of nervous illnesses, when I was still receiving La Semaine M\u00e9dicale, but back then I had other concerns, which left me no spare time to begin biological studies. I must say I forgot those works and I am thankful to you that you reminded them to me. Unfortunately, not many scientists have followed your way.\"[4]\n Marinescu maintained close academic links with his Parisian colleagues and many of his articles, which exceeded 250 in number, were published in French. He had a wide range of research interests, including pathological anatomy and experimental neuropathology. Daily contact with scores of the infirm and his astuteness made him use the latest methods as they became available, such as the X-ray, with which he investigated bone changes in acromegaly, and the film camera, for the study of body movements in health and disease. The results of these studies appeared in the monograph Le Tonus des Muscles stri\u00e9s (1937) with Nicolae Ionescu-Sise\u015fti, Oskar Sager and Arthur Kreindler, with a preface by Sir Charles Scott Sherrington.\n Early in his career, Marinescu published a much needed atlas on the pathological histology of the nervous system with the bacteriologist Victor Babe\u015f and the French pathologist Paul Oscar Blocq. His description with Blocq, of a case of Parkinsonian tremor due to tumour in the substantia nigra in 1893, was the basis for \u00c9douard Brissaud's theory that Parkinsonism occurs as a consequence of damage to the substantia nigra. With Blocq he was the first to describe senile plaques and with Romanian neurologist Ion Minea he confirmed in 1913 Hideyo Noguchi's discovery of Treponema pallidum in the brain in patients with general paresis.  His monumental work La Cellule Nerveuse, with a preface by Santiago Ramon y Cajal, appeared in 1909.\n Marinescu was an eminent teacher. In his lectures he emphasised ideas and gave perspective for further investigations. Recognition in the form of honours came to him from many countries. It was he above all others who was chosen to represent the students of Charcot when the centenary of the great master was celebrated in 1925.\n ", "tags": ["Titular members of the Romanian Academy", "Romanian inventors", "Romanian neurologists", "1863 births", "1938 deaths", "University of Bucharest alumni", "Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy faculty", "Articles with Romanian-language sources (ro)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2015", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For the Romanian mathematician, see George Marinescu (mathematician).\nGheorghe MarinescuGheorghe Marinescu on a 1962 Romanian post stampBorn28 February 1863Bucharest, United PrincipalitiesDied15 May 1938\u00a0(1938-05-16) (aged\u00a075)Bucharest, Kingdom of RomaniaNationalityRomaniaOther\u00a0namesGeorge/Georges MarinescoAlma\u00a0materBucharest UniversityKnown\u00a0forRomanian School of NeurologyScientific careerFieldsNeurology\n\nGheorghe Marinescu (Romanian:\u00a0[\u02c8\u0261e\u032for\u0261e mari\u02c8nesku]; 28 February 1863 \u2013 15 May 1938) was a Romanian neurologist, founder of the Romanian School of Neurology.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n2 Career\n3 Legacy\n4 Associated eponyms\n5 See also\n6 Notes\n7 References\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nAfter attending the Faculty of Medicine of Bucharest University, Marinescu received most of his medical education as preparator at the laboratory of histology at the Br\u00e2ncoveanu Hospital and as assistant at the Bacteriological Institute under Victor Babe\u015f, who had already published several works on myelitis transversa, hysterical muteness, and dilatation of the pupil in pneumonia.\n\nCareer[edit]\nAfter qualification, and on the recommendation of Babe\u015f, the government awarded Marinescu a grant to undertake postgraduate training in neurology under Jean-Martin Charcot at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital in Paris, where he met Pierre Marie, Joseph Babinski and Fulgence Raymond.
