{"name": "William H. Swanson", "content": "William H. Swanson (born 1949) is the former chairman and CEO of Raytheon Company (2004 -2014). [1]\n A native of California, Swanson graduated magna cum laude from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo with a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering. He attended Cal Poly with the assistance of a golf scholarship.[2]  He was awarded an honorary Doctorate from Pepperdine University and served on the Board of Regents of Pepperdine.  He was selected as the Outstanding Industrial Engineering Graduate in 1972, and in 1991 was recognized as an Honored Alumnus by California Polytechnic State University College of Engineering. He attended a graduate degree program in business administration at Golden Gate University.\n Swanson joined Raytheon in 1972 and held a wide range of leadership positions, including manufacturing manager of the company\u2019s Equipment Division, general manager of the Missile Systems Division's Andover Plant, senior vice president and general manager of the Missile Systems Division, general manager of Raytheon Electronic Systems, and president, chairman and chief executive officer of Raytheon Systems Company.\n Before becoming chairman of Raytheon in January 2004, Swanson was CEO and president of the company. Prior to that he was president of the company, responsible for Raytheon\u2019s government and defense operations, including the four Strategic Business Areas of Missile Defense; Precision Engagement; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); and Homeland Security. Before that, he was a Raytheon executive vice president and president of Electronic Systems.\n As a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Chairman and CEO Dennis Picard and a long-time Raytheon insider, he was the expected candidate to succeed the retiring chairman in the late 1990s.  However, Daniel Burnham, an outsider, was elected to succeed Dennis Picard as Chairman and CEO. After Burnham completed a five-year contract with Raytheon, Swanson was elevated to his position.\n Swanson stepped down from the CEO position in March 2014 and retired from Raytheon entirely in September 2014.  He was succeeded by Dr. Thomas A. Kennedy, who had previously served as Raytheon's Chief Operating Officer.[3]\n Swanson released a short work called Swanson's Unwritten Rules of Management, thirty three sound-bite rules, including the comparatively well known \"Waiter Rule\".\n On April 24, 2006, in a statement[11]  released by Raytheon, Swanson admitted to plagiarism in claiming authorship for his booklet, \"Swanson's Unwritten Rules of Management,\" after being exposed by an article in The New York Times. On May 2, 2006, Raytheon withdrew distribution of the book.[12]  On May 3, 2006, Raytheon punished Swanson by reducing his compensation by approximately $1 million for publishing what was \"later found to have been taken from a 1944 engineering classic, The Unwritten Laws of Engineering, by W. J. King.\"[13]  Further investigation by the Boston Herald revealed that Swanson had also copied some of the rules from former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld[14] and columnist Dave Barry.[15]\n The Boston Globe, the major newspaper in Raytheon's home town, reported \"the move was largely symbolic given Swanson's robust $7 million pay package in 2005.\"[16]\n \n ", "tags": ["American chief executives of manufacturing companies", "1949 births", "Living people", "Raytheon Company people", "Golden Gate University alumni", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles to be expanded from May 2011", "All articles to be expanded", "Articles using small message boxes"], "raw": "For other people named William Swanson, see William Swanson (disambiguation).\n William H.
