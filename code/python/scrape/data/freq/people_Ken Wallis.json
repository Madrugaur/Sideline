{"name": "Ken Wallis", "content": "\n Wing Commander Kenneth Horatio Wallis DSO MBE CEng FRAeS RAF (26 April 1916\u00a0\u2013 1 September 2013)[1] was a British aviator, engineer, and inventor. During the Second World War, Wallis served in the Royal Air Force and flew 28 bomber missions over Germany; after the war, he moved on to research and development, before retiring in 1964. He later became one of the leading exponents of autogyros and earned 34 world records, still holding eight of them at the time of his death in 2013.[2]\n Born on 26 April 1916 at Ely, He was educated at The Kings' School Ely Cambridgeshire. Wallis developed a practical interest in mechanics, building a motorcycle at the age of 11. In 1936, he was inspired by a demonstration by Henri Mignet of his Mignet HM.14 Pou-du-Ciel (\"Flying Flea\"). Using only Mignet's book, Wallis gathered the materials required, and started to build his own Flying Flea. He abandoned construction because of widespread adverse publicity about fatal accidents that implied inadequate design of the type.[3]\n Wallis took an interest in powerboats which he kept up until 1957, when he won the 56-mile (90\u00a0km) long Missouri Marathon.\n Wallis was keen to join the RAF, and applied for their Volunteer Reserve Service, but he was turned down due to a defective right eye. Consequently, he obtained a private flying licence. which required only a certificate signed by his GP. Wallis obtained his A Licence for dual and solo flying in a record 12 hours. In 1938, Wallis tried to join the RAF again, this time with the newly formed RAF Short Service Commission Scheme, but again failed the eye test. In 1939, he was called up to RAF Uxbridge, and again was sent for a medical. When it came to the eyesight test he managed to pass, as Wallis later recalled, \"I did the first line with my good eye then they covered it up and asked me to read the bottom line with my bad eye, without them realising I just turned my head slightly so I could again see with my good eye\u00a0\u2014 I passed it with Above Average Eye Sight!\"[4]\n Wallis's military career started with Westland Lysander patrols in the RAF. In 1942, he was transferred to RAF Bomber Command, flying Wellingtons near Grimsby. Wallis subsequently served in Italy and on secondment to the United States Strategic Air Command, where he flew the massive Convair B-36, that had six piston engines and four auxiliary jet engines. Thereafter, he was involved in research and development, and was awarded a number of patents on his inventions. Wallis left the RAF in 1964, retiring to Norfolk.\n Wallis produced autogyros for, in his own words, \"reconnaissance, research and development, surveillance and military purposes\", and his designs were not available for enthusiasts as he considered that although the design is simple, it has to be built to the appropriate standards. His contribution to autogyro design included the \"offset gimbal rotor head\".[5]\n Wallis had the help of Beagle Aircraft in building five Wallis WA-116 autogyros at Shoreham in 1962 for evaluation by the British Army. This collaboration ended when the British Army chose the Westland Sioux for this role.\n Wallis worked as Sean Connery's stunt pilot in the 1967 James Bond film You Only Live Twice, where he flew one of his WA-116s named Little Nellie.\n In 1970 it was announced that Airmark would produce his autogyro design with a certificate of airworthiness (C of A), that being essential for commercial use of the autogyro. Expected price was around \u00a33,000.[6]\n Between 2006 and 2009, Wallis took part in filming for Into the Wind, a documentary by Steven Hatton featuring the experiences and memories of wartime members of Bomber Command. The film, released in 2012, features Wallis demonstrating several of his autogyro designs.\n Wallis was the President of the Norfolk and Suffolk Aviation Museum, and Patron of the Wolf Preservation Foundation.\n Wallis was the recognized world record holder for many categories of autogyro records over the years, and was also recognized as the oldest pilot to set a world flight record at the age of 89. Wallis held most of the autogyro world records during his autogyro flying career. These include the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale time-to-climb,[7] a speed record of 189\u00a0km/h (111.7\u00a0mph),[8] and the straight-line distance record of 869.23\u00a0km (540.11\u00a0mi). On 16 November 2002, Wallis increased the speed record to 207.7\u00a0km/h (129.1\u00a0mph).[9]\n Wallis appeared as himself on an episode of Tell The Truth dated 9 November 1984, discussing his autogyro record.\n Wallis received the MBE in 1996.\n In July 2013, Wallis received a campaign medal for his 28 bomber missions over Germany during World War II.[citation needed]\n He was married to Peggy Stapley, a Women's Auxiliary Air Force veteran, from 1942 to her death in 2003.[2][10] Wallis died on 1 September 2013, aged 97. Prior to his death, he was living in the quiet Norfolk village of Reymerston.\n Old Buckenham Airport held a memorial event on 29 September at the request of the Wallis family: \"A Celebration of the Life of Wing Commander Ken Wallis\".[11] It had been expected that about 500 people would attend, but an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 attended the event.[12][13][14]\n ", "tags": ["Companions of the Distinguished Service Order", "Members of the Order of the British Empire", "Fellows of the Royal Aeronautical Society", "Royal Air Force officers", "1916 births", "2013 deaths", "People from Ely, Cambridgeshire", "English aviators", "British World War II pilots", "British World War II bomber pilots", "Segrave Trophy recipients", "British aviation record holders", "English inventors", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Use British English from November 2013", "Use dmy dates from December 2020", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from June 2020", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For the Hong Kong lawn bowler and footballer, see Ken Wallis (bowls).\n\n\nKenneth Horatio WallisDSO MBE DEng CEng FRAeS PhDAutogyro Little Nellie with its creator and pilot, Ken WallisBorn(1916-04-26)26 April 1916Ely, CambridgeshireDied1 September 2013(2013-09-01) (aged\u00a097)Dereham, NorfolkAllegiance\u00a0United KingdomService/branch\u00a0Royal Air ForceYears\u00a0of service1939\u20131964RankWing CommanderUnitNo. 268 Squadron RAFNo. 103 Squadron RAFNo. 37 Squadron RAFBattles/warsWorld War IIAwardsDistinguished Service OrderOther\u00a0workLeading exponent of autogyros\nWing Commander Kenneth Horatio Wallis DSO MBE CEng FRAeS RAF (26 April 1916\u00a0\u2013 1 September 2013)[1] was a British aviator, engineer, and inventor.
