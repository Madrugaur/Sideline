{"name": "Hans Samelson", "content": "Hans Samelson (3 March 1916 \u2013 22 September 2005) was a German American mathematician who worked in differential geometry, topology and the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras\u2014important in describing the symmetry of analytical structures.\n The eldest of three sons, Samelson was born on 3 March 1916, in Strassburg, Germany (now Strasbourg, France). His brother Klaus later became a mathematician and early computer science pioneer in Germany. His parents\u2014one of Protestant and one of Jewish background\u2014were both pediatricians. He spent most of his youth in Breslau, Silesia, Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland), and began his advanced mathematical education there, at the University of Breslau. His family helped him leave Nazi Germany in 1936 for Zurich, Switzerland, where he studied with the geometer Heinz Hopf and received his doctorate in 1940 from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.\n In 1941, he accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and immigrated to the United States; he arrived by ship six months before the United States entered World War II and acquired U.S. citizenship several years later. After leaving Princeton, he held faculty positions at the University of Wyoming (1942\u20131943), Syracuse University (1943\u20131946) and the University of Michigan (1946\u20131960) before coming to Stanford in 1960. He was recognized with the Dean's Award for Distinguished Teaching in 1977. He served as chair of the Mathematics Department from 1979 to 1982.\n Though he became emeritus in 1986, he remained professionally active throughout his retirement, publishing articles on both contemporary and historical mathematical topics. One solved an architectural puzzle associated with the construction of the Brunelleschi Dome in Florence, Italy.\n He was active in the Palo Alto Friends Meeting (Quakers) during his retirement, serving as treasurer for several years.\n ", "tags": ["1916 births", "2005 deaths", "20th-century German mathematicians", "American people of German-Jewish descent", "Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United States", "ETH Zurich alumni", "Stanford University Department of Mathematics faculty", "University of Michigan faculty", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Topologists", "Differential geometers", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from September 2012", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German-American mathematician\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
