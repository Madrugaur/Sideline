Because the family was critical of the new Soviet system, they left Russia in 1921. They first went to Germany and in 1929, to Belgium, where Prigogine received Belgian nationality in 1949. His brother Alexandre (1913\u20131991) became an ornithologist.[10]\n Prigogine studied chemistry at the Free University of Brussels, where in 1950, he became professor. In 1959, he was appointed director of the International Solvay Institute in Brussels, Belgium. In that year, he also started teaching at the University of Texas at Austin in the United States, where he later was appointed Regental Professor and Ashbel Smith Professor of Physics and Chemical Engineering. From 1961 until 1966 he was affiliated with the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago and was a visiting professor at Northwestern University.[11][12] In Austin, in 1967, he co-founded the Center for Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, now the Center for Complex Quantum Systems.[13] In that year, he also returned to Belgium, where he became director of the Center for Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics.\n He was a member of numerous scientific organizations, and received numerous awards, prizes and 53 honorary degrees. In 1955, Ilya Prigogine was awarded the Francqui Prize for Exact Sciences. For his study in irreversible thermodynamics, he received the Rumford Medal in 1976, and in 1977, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1989, he was awarded the title of Viscount in the Belgian nobility by the King of the Belgians. Until his death, he was president of the International Academy of Science, Munich and was in 1997, one of the founders of the International Commission on Distance Education (CODE), a worldwide accreditation agency.[14][15] Prigogine received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1985[16] and in 1998 he was awarded an honoris causa doctorate by the UNAM in Mexico City.\n Prigogine was first married to Belgian poet H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Jof\u00e9 (as an author also known as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Prigogine) and in 1945 they had a son Yves. After their divorce, he married Polish-born chemist Maria Prokopowicz (also known as Maria Prigogine) in 1961. In 1970 they had a son Pascal.[17]\n In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.[18]\n Prigogine is best known for his definition of dissipative structures and their role in thermodynamic systems far from equilibrium, a discovery that won him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977. In summary, Ilya Prigogine discovered that importation and dissipation of energy into chemical systems could result in the emergence of new structures (hence dissipative structures) due to internal self reorganization.[19] In his 1955 text, Prigogine drew connections between dissipative structures and the Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard instability and the Turing mechanism.[20]\n Dissipative structure theory led to pioneering research in self-organizing systems, as well as philosophical inquiries into the formation of complexity on biological entities and the quest for a creative and irreversible role of time in the natural sciences. See the criticism by Joel Keizer and Ronald Fox.[21][further explanation needed]\n With professor Robert Herman, he also developed the basis of the two fluid model, a traffic model in traffic engineering for urban networks, analogous to the two fluid model in classical statistical mechanics.\n Prigogine's formal concept of self-organization was used also as a \"complementary bridge\" between General Systems Theory and thermodynamics, conciliating the cloudiness of some important systems theory concepts[which?] with scientific rigour.[citation needed]\n In his later years, his work concentrated on the fundamental role of indeterminism in nonlinear systems on both the classical and quantum level. Prigogine and coworkers proposed a Liouville space extension of quantum mechanics. A Liouville space is the vector space formed by the set of (self-adjoint) linear operators, equipped with an inner product, that act on a Hilbert space.[22] There exists a mapping of each linear operator into Liouville space, yet not every self-adjoint operator of Liouville space has a counterpart in Hilbert space, and in this sense Liouville space has a richer structure than Hilbert space.[23] The Liouville space extension proposal by Prigogine and co-workers aimed to solve the arrow of time problem of thermodynamics and the measurement problem of quantum mechanics.[24]\n Prigogine co-authored several books with Isabelle Stengers, including The End of Certainty and La Nouvelle Alliance (Order out of Chaos).\n In his 1996 book, La Fin des certitudes, written in collaboration with Isabelle Stengers and published in English in 1997 as The End of Certainty: Time, Chaos, and the New Laws of Nature, Prigogine contends that determinism is no longer a viable scientific belief: \"The more we know about our universe, the more difficult it becomes to believe in determinism.\" This is a major departure from the approach of Newton, Einstein and Schr\u00f6dinger, all of whom expressed their theories in terms of deterministic equations. According to Prigogine, determinism loses its explanatory power in the face of irreversibility and instability.[citation needed]\n Prigogine traces the dispute over determinism back to Darwin, whose attempt to explain individual variability according to evolving populations inspired Ludwig Boltzmann to explain the behavior of gases in terms of populations of particles rather than individual particles.[25] This led to the field of statistical mechanics and the realization that gases undergo irreversible processes. In deterministic physics, all processes are time-reversible, meaning that they can proceed backward as well as forward through time. As Prigogine explains, determinism is fundamentally a denial of the arrow of time. With no arrow of time, there is no longer a privileged moment known as the \"present,\" which follows a determined \"past\" and precedes an undetermined \"future.\" All of time is simply given, with the future as determined or as undetermined as the past. With irreversibility, the arrow of time is reintroduced to physics. Prigogine notes numerous examples of irreversibility, including diffusion, radioactive decay, solar radiation, weather and the emergence and evolution of life. Like weather systems, organisms are unstable systems existing far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Instability resists standard deterministic explanation. Instead, due to sensitivity to initial conditions, unstable systems can only be explained statistically, that is, in terms of probability.\n Prigogine asserts that Newtonian physics has now been \"extended\" three times:[citation needed] first with the introduction of spacetime in general relativity, then with the use of the wave function in quantum mechanics, and finally with the recognition of indeterminism in the study of unstable systems (chaos theory).\n ", "tags": ["1917 births", "2003 deaths", "Nobel laureates in Chemistry", "Belgian Nobel laureates", "Jewish Nobel laureates", "Soviet emgirants to Germany", "German emigrants to Belgium", "Belgian physicists", "Jewish physicists", "Belgian physical chemists", "Jewish physical chemists", "Belgian academics", "Belgian systems scientists", "Jewish systems scientists", "Complex systems scientists", "Theoretical chemists", "Thermodynamicists", "Free University of Brussels alumni", "University of Texas at Austin faculty", "Foreign Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Foreign Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Jewish chemists", "Jewish scientists", "Belgian Jews", "Belgian people of Russian-Jewish descent", "Naturalised citizens of Belgium", "Viscounts of Belgium", "People from Moscow", "Emigrants from the Russian Empire to Belgium", "Computational chemists", "Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from November 2019", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from July 2019", "All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases", "Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from December 2013", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2015", "Articles with unsourced statements from April 2017", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2012", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from July 2020", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "AC with 25 elements"], "raw": "Russian-Belgian physical chemist (1917 - 2003)\n\n\nIlya PrigoginePrigogine in 1977BornIlya Romanovich Prigogine(1917-01-25)25 January 1917Moscow, Russian EmpireDied28 May 2003(2003-05-28) (aged\u00a086)Brussels, BelgiumNationalityBelgian (1949\u2014)Alma\u00a0materFree University of BrusselsKnown\u00a0forDissipative structures  BrusselatorSpouse(s)H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Jof\u00e9 (m. 1945;
