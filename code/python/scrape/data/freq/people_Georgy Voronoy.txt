{"name": "Georgy Voronoy", "content": "Georgy Feodosevich Voronoy (Russian: \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0301\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0301\u0441\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0301\u0439; 28 April 1868 \u2013 20 November 1908) was a Russian mathematician noted for defining the Voronoi diagram.[1][2]\n Voronoy was born in the village of Zhuravka, Pyriatyn, in the Poltava Governorate, which was a part of the Russian Empire at that time and is in Varva Raion, Chernihiv Oblast, Ukraine.\n From 1889, Voronoy studied at Saint Petersburg University, where he was a student of Andrey Markov. In 1894 he defended his master's thesis On algebraic integers depending on the roots of an equation of third degree.  In the same year, Voronoy became a professor at the University of Warsaw, where he worked on continued fractions.  In 1897, he defended his doctoral thesis On a generalisation of a continuous fraction. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1904 at Heidelberg.[3]\n \nBy the time he was only 40 years of age, Voronoy started feeling sick to his stomach. He wrote in his diary:[4] I am making great progress with the question under study [indefinite quadratic forms]; however, at the same time my health is becoming worse and worse. Yesterday I had for the first time a clear idea of the algorithm in the theory of forms I am investigating, but also suffered a strong attack of bilious colic which prevented me from working in the evening and from sleeping the whole night. I am so afraid that the results of my enduring efforts, obtained with such difficulty, will perish along with me. Following a severe gall bladder attack, Voronoy died on November 20, 1908.\n Voronoy introduced the concept of what we today call Voronoi diagrams or tessellations. They are used in many areas of science, such as the analysis of spatially distributed data, having become an important topic in geophysics, meteorology, condensed matter physics, and Lie groups.\n These tessellations are widely used in many areas of computer graphics, from architecture to film making and video games. Blender 3D includes a Voronoi texture generator as one of its main sources of randomly generated images, that can be applied as textures for many different uses.\n Among his students was Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski (Ph.D. at Jagiellonian University in 1906). Although he was not formally the doctoral advisor of Boris Delaunay (Ph.D. at Kyiv University), his influence on the latter earns him the right to be considered so.[5]\n In 2008, Ukraine released two-hryvnia coins commemorating the centenary of Voronoy's death.[6]\n His son Yuriy Voronoy became a prominent transplant surgeon who performed the world's first human-to-human kidney transplant in 1933.[7]\n ", "tags": ["1868 births", "1908 deaths", "People from Varva Raion", "People from Poltava Governorate", "People from Warsaw Governorate", "19th-century mathematicians", "19th-century Russian mathematicians", "20th-century Russian mathematicians", "Ukrainian mathematicians", "Mathematicians of the Russian Empire", "University of Warsaw faculty", "Saint Petersburg State University alumni", "Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences", "CS1: long volume value", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Georgy VoronoyBornGeorgy Feodosevich Voronoy (\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0301\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0301\u0441\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0301\u0439)(1868-04-28)28 April 1868Zhuravka, Poltava Governorate, Russian EmpireDied20 November 1908(1908-11-20) (aged\u00a040)Warsaw, Congress Poland, Russian EmpireOther\u00a0namesGeorgiy Feodosiyovich Voronyi (\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0456\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0439; name in Ukrainian)Alma\u00a0materSaint Petersburg UniversityKnown\u00a0forVoronoi diagram (Voronoy Tessellation)Voronoi iterationVoronoi formulaScientific careerFieldsContinued fractionsInstitutionsUniversity of WarsawDoctoral advisorAndrey MarkovDoctoral studentsWac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144skiBoris Delaunay\n\nGeorgy Feodosevich Voronoy (Russian: \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0301\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0301\u0441\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0301\u0439; 28 April 1868 \u2013 20 November 1908) was a Russian mathematician noted for defining the Voronoi diagram.[1][2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Works\n3 Legacy\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 Further reading\n7 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nVoronoy was born in the village of Zhuravka, Pyriatyn, in the Poltava Governorate, which was a part of the Russian Empire at that time and is in Varva Raion, Chernihiv Oblast, Ukraine.\nFrom 1889, Voronoy studied at Saint Petersburg University, where he was a student of Andrey Markov.
