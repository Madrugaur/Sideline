{"name": "Jacob Wolfowitz", "content": "Jacob Wolfowitz (March 19, 1910 \u2013 July 16, 1981) was a Polish-born American Jewish statistician and Shannon Award-winning information theorist.  He was the father of former United States Deputy Secretary of Defense and World Bank Group President Paul Wolfowitz.\n Wolfowitz was born in 1910 in Warsaw, Poland, the son of Helen (Pearlman) and Samuel Wolfowitz.[1] He emigrated with his parents to the United States in 1920. In the mid-1930s, Wolfowitz began his career as a high school mathematics teacher and continued teaching until 1942 when he received his Ph.D. degree in mathematics from New York University. While a part-time graduate student, Wolfowitz met Abraham Wald, with whom he collaborated in numerous joint papers in the field of mathematical statistics. This collaboration continued until Wald's death in an airplane crash in 1950. In 1951, Wolfowitz became a professor of mathematics at Cornell University, where he stayed until 1970. From 1970 to 1978 he was at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign. He died of a heart attack in Tampa, Florida, where he had become a professor at the University of South Florida after retiring from Illinois.\n Wolfowitz's main contributions were in the fields of statistical decision theory, non-parametric statistics, sequential analysis, and information theory.\n One of his results is the strong converse to Claude Shannon's coding theorem. While Shannon could prove only that the block error probability can not become arbitrarily small if the transmission rate is above the channel capacity, Wolfowitz proved that the block error rate actually converges to one. As a consequence, Shannon's original result is today termed \"the weak theorem\" (sometimes also Shannon's \"conjecture\" by some authors).\n ", "tags": ["1910 births", "1981 deaths", "American statisticians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences alumni", "Cornell University faculty", "University of South Florida faculty", "American people of Polish-Jewish descent", "Ashkenazi Jews", "Polish Ashkenazi Jews", "Jewish American scientists", "Jewish scientists", "Presidents of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics", "Fellows of the American Statistical Association", "Polish emigrants to the United States", "Probability theorists", "Fellows of the Econometric Society", "Articles lacking in-text citations from March 2013", "All articles lacking in-text citations", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article includes a list of general references, but it remains largely unverified because it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations.
