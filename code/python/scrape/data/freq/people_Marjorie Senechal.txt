{"name": "Marjorie Senechal", "content": "Marjorie Lee Senechal (n\u00e9e Wikler, born 1939) is an American mathematician and historian of science, the Louise Wolff Kahn Professor Emerita in Mathematics and History of Science and Technology at Smith College[1] and editor-in-chief of The Mathematical Intelligencer.[2] In mathematics, she is known for her work on tessellations and quasicrystals; she has also studied ancient Parthian electric batteries[3] and published several books about silk.[4]\n Senechal was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the oldest of four children of Abraham Wikler, a United States Public Health Service physician. The family soon moved to Lexington, Kentucky, and Senechal grew up as a \"narco brat\" on the grounds of the Lexington Narcotic Hospital, a prison farm for drug addicts, where her father was associate director.[5][6] She was educated at the Training School of the University of Kentucky, a small school with only one class in each grade; Senechal later wrote that the school's too-easy classwork, snobbish classmates, and anti-Jewish discrimination made her miserable.[7]\n She left Lafayette High School after the 11th grade to begin her undergraduate studies as a pre-med at the University of Chicago, but soon switched to mathematics, graduating in 1960.[8] While doing graduate studies at the Illinois Institute of Technology, she married mathematician Lester Senechal, and moved to Arizona with him before completing her own degree.[8] Nevertheless, she finished her Ph.D. in 1965, under the supervision of Abe Sklar; her thesis concerned functional equations.[9]\n Unable to get her own faculty position at Arizona because of the anti-nepotism rules then in place, she and her husband visited Brazil, supported by a Fulbright Scholarship. They then moved to Massachusetts, where she took the faculty position at Smith that she would keep for the rest of her career.[5] She eventually divorced Senechal, and married photographer Stan Sherer in 1989.[8] She retired in 2007; a festival in 2006 honoring her impending retirement included the performance of a musical play that she wrote with The Talking Band member Ellen Maddow, loosely centered around the theme of aperiodic tilings and the life of amateur mathematician Robert Ammann.[10][11][12]\n Senechal won the Mathematical Association of America's Carl B. Allendoerfer Award for excellence in expository writing in Mathematics Magazine in 1982, for her article, \"Which Tetrahedra Fill Space?\"[8][13] In 2008, her book American Silk 1830 \u2013 1930 won the Millia Davenport Publication Award of the Costume Society of America.[14] In 2012, she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[15]\n ", "tags": ["1939 births", "Living people", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "Scientists from St. Louis", "Scientists from Missouri", "Mathematicians from Missouri", "Historians of science", "University of Chicago alumni", "Illinois Institute of Technology alumni", "Smith College faculty", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Webarchive template archiveis links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nMarjorie SenechalBornMarjorie Wikler1939St. Louis, MissouriAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ChicagoIllinois Institute of TechnologyScientific careerFieldsmathematicshistory of scienceInstitutionsSmith College\n\nMarjorie Lee Senechal (n\u00e9e Wikler, born 1939) is an American mathematician and historian of science, the Louise Wolff Kahn Professor Emerita in Mathematics and History of Science and Technology at Smith College[1] and editor-in-chief of The Mathematical Intelligencer.[2] In mathematics, she is known for her work on tessellations and quasicrystals; she has also studied ancient Parthian electric batteries[3] and published several books about silk.[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Awards and honors\n3 Books\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nSenechal was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the oldest of four children of Abraham Wikler, a United States Public Health Service physician.
