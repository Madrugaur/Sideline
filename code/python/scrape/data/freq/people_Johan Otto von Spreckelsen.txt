{"name": "Johan Otto von Spreckelsen", "content": "Johan Otto von Spreckelsen (4 May 1929 \u2014 16 March 1987) was a Danish architect, best known for designing the Grande Arche of La D\u00e9fense in Puteaux, near Paris. He directed the creation of several modern churches in Denmark.[1][2]\n He was born in Viborg and studied at the Viborg Katedralskole and Royal Academy of Arts in Copenhagen. He later became associate professor at the Academy and from 1978 he was professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture. He later served as director up to the time of his death.[3][4]\n He directed the creation of several modern churches in Denmark: Vangede Kirke near Copenhagen (1974), Stavnsholt Kirke at the city of Farum (1981) and two Roman Catholic churches including one in Esbjerg (1969), St Nikolaj Church, and Hvidovre (1960), also consecrated to Saint Nicholas.[5]\n He was modest about his accomplishments. Once in an interview, he declared that he was an architect who built three churches and a house.[6] He relied heavily on simple geometrical figures, especially the quadrant, which can be seen in his churches, in the interior decorations even of church organs.[7]\n His design won the international competition of the Grande Arche in Puteaux, France, as the French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand felt it was the best because of its 'purity and strength'. This work of 110 meters of height, which was inaugurated in 1989, two years after his death, used with remarkable ability the technology of its time, and was inspired by the nearby Arc de Triomphe.\nThe monument, located in the heart of the financial district of La D\u00e9fense, is built of granite and of Carrara marble. From its terrace, it is possible to admire a panoramic view all along the Axe historique with the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde and the gardens of the Tuileries and the Louvre beyond.[8][9]\n In 1955, he was married to Karen Gerda Gustavsen.\nJohan Otto von Spreckelsen died in H\u00f8rsholm and was buried at H\u00f8rsholm Kirkeg\u00e5rd.\n Vangede Kirke\n Stavnsholt Kirke\n Vangede plan\n St Nikolaj, Esbjerg\n ", "tags": ["1929 births", "1987 deaths", "People from Viborg Municipality", "Modernist architects", "Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts alumni", "Directors of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts", "20th-century Danish architects", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " The Grande Arche in Puteaux - his best-known design.\n Spreckelsen's childhood home in Viborg\nJohan Otto von Spreckelsen (4 May 1929 \u2014 16 March 1987) was a Danish architect, best known for designing the Grande Arche of La D\u00e9fense in Puteaux, near Paris.
