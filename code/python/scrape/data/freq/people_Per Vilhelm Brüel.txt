{"name": "Per Vilhelm Br\u00fcel", "content": "Per Vilhelm Br\u00fcel  (6 March 1915 \u2013 2 April 2015) was a Danish physicist and engineer who pioneered and made fundamental contributions to the development of the physics of sound and vibration. He also formed and founded the world's largest manufacturer and supplier of sound and vibration measurement equipment, systems and solutions, Br\u00fcel & Kj\u00e6r. Br\u00fcel was a close friend of Niels Bohr, and despite danger Br\u00fcel traveled from Sweden to Denmark during the German occupation with important documents of Bohr's work.[1][2]\nBr\u00fcel was fluent in Danish, German, English, Swedish, and spoke French and Italian.[3]\n Br\u00fcel was a descendant of the Br\u00fcel branch of the German noble family, the von Br\u00fchl family.\n Br\u00fcel was born in Copenhagen as the eldest son to his family. Br\u00fcel's father was a forester, a tradition that he intended his son to continue. However, Br\u00fcel did not like the idea of becoming a forester, causing a family scandal.\n The family lived in the South of Jutland, away from schools and towns. When Br\u00fcel got older, he was sent away for \"blacksmith\" education, which then denoted a practical education in engineering. But he decided to attend university and reallocated to the technical university in Copenhagen. There Br\u00fcel pursued aerodynamics, electronics, and acoustics.[4]\n At the Technical University of Denmark, Br\u00fcel started working on his Ph.D, which today would be equivalent to master of science, in 1932, and finished it in about five months. Br\u00fcel's mentor was P.O. Pedersen, a famous Danish engineer and physicist, and Br\u00fcel was handpicked by Pedersen to work with him. Br\u00fcel later described Pedersen as brilliant, but that he took credit for Br\u00fcel's and his other students' work.[5]\n In January 1939, Br\u00fcel was drafted into the Danish army to do the radio for the military for a year, and it was there he built his first instrument, a battery-operated, constant-percentage bandwidth analyzer.\n In the end of 1942, due to German occupation of Denmark, Br\u00fcel went to work in Sweden. He there went on to do important work in both Sweden and Finland, including constructing an acoustic lab at Chalmers University.[6]\n In 1942, Br\u00fcel started the company Br\u00fcel & Kj\u00e6r with his old friend Kj\u00e6r. The company experienced immediate growth, and they quickly expanded their sales throughout Scandinavia. However, due to WW2, they soon had shortage of copper. Luckily, Br\u00fcel had a good friend who was trying to cause problems for the Germans, and informed Br\u00fcel about Germans' thick communication cable from Copenhagen to Berlin that was in the sea, and together they picked it up, destroying Hitler's communication with his troops for some time.[7] In 1945, Holger Nielsen became a partner in the firm, for which he worked until his death in 1978.\n Despite the ongoing world war, Br\u00fcel managed to navigate his company and career to further success. In 1948, Br\u00fcel & Kj\u00e6r bought their first property, a wooden army barracks in N\u00e6rum, 15\u00a0km north of Copenhagen, which are the premises where the company's headquarter is still located today. Br\u00fcel was responsible for product planning and research. As long as the market was limited to Denmark and Sweden, Br\u00fcel initially delivered instruments to customers on his Nimbus motorcycle. He still has this original antique in the basement of his home.\n When the rest of Scandinavia and some parts of Europe joined the market, cars were needed. By the 1980s, there were about 30 company cars. In 1956, with customers in the rest of Europe and in some other parts of the world, \"Br\u00fcel & Kj\u00e6r Airlines\" was established. The company eventually maintained a substantial fleet of aircraft, including two Piper Aztecs and two Beechcraft King Airs. This made it possible for Br\u00fcel and other company pilots to make airborne deliveries directly to any customer that was located near a general aviation airport. The fleet also provided high-speed transportation, independent of the scheduled airlines, to employees and customers. When Br\u00fcel was flying as PIC (pilot in command), he would often appoint a nontrained employee to be a co-pilot on some of his trips. Br\u00fcel often blamed (in jest) these hapless individuals for doing a lousy piloting job. In the mid 80s, a number of employees were asked to get a pilot license to fly with Br\u00fcel due to concern with his advancing age. He subsequently solved this issue by hiring his flight instructor as his personal co-pilot. To the consternation of passengers, he was even older than Br\u00fcel\n Kj\u00e6r used a bicycle as primary transportation between home and work, while Br\u00fcel used a company aircraft for commuting to and from his summer house on Anholt Island. In regard to automobiles, Nielsen used a Jaguar while Br\u00fcel had a Fiat 500. When asked why he preferred the Fiat to the other more comfortable company cars, Br\u00fcel answered that the comfort in a Fiat 500 was so poor that he could keep the car for himself; nobody in the company would ever ask him for a lift.[8]\n In 1953, Br\u00fcel & Kj\u00e6r was part of the first European corporation delegation into China. Br\u00fcel died at the age of 100 on 2 April 2015.[9]\n Br\u00fcel was a close friend of Niels Bohr and frequently attended dinners at Bohr's house, where they would dine and discuss physics.\n When Br\u00fcel and Bohr both lived in Sweden during WW2, Br\u00fcel neglected apparent danger and flew to Denmark from time to time, carrying his friend Bohr's documents of his important work on quantum physics.[10]\n Br\u00fcel was instrumental in the construction of the level recorder, which would become one of the most successful products for his company Br\u00fcel & Kj\u00e6r. Br\u00fcel was a pioneering engineer within acoustics, and started one of the first companies focused on acoustics. He  celebrated his 100th birthday in March 2015.[11]\n Br\u00fcel & Kj\u00e6r's pioneering achievements:[12]\n (1) Mowry, Jackson, and Borring, Ghita, book \"The Journey to Greatness: the Story of Br\u00fcel & Kj\u00e6r\", Acoustical Publications, Inc., Bay Village, 2012.\n (2) http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Per_Bruel\n (3) http://www.sandv.com/downloads/0808gade.pdf\n (4) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOJWbidWzmo\n (5) http://www.bksv.com/aboutus/aboutbruelandkjaer/history\n \n ", "tags": ["1915 births", "2015 deaths", "Danish engineers", "Danish centenarians", "CS1 Danish-language sources (da)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers"], "raw": "Danish physicist\nPer Vilhelm Br\u00fcelBorn(1915-03-06)6 March 1915Copenhagen, DenmarkDied2 April 2015(2015-04-02) (aged\u00a0100)NationalityDanishAlma\u00a0materTechnical University of DenmarkOccupationPhysicist, EngineerFamilyvon Br\u00fchl\nPer Vilhelm Br\u00fcel  (6 March 1915 \u2013 2 April 2015) was a Danish physicist and engineer who pioneered and made fundamental contributions to the development of the physics of sound and vibration.
