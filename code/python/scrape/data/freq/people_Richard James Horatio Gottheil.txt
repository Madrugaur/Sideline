{"name": "Richard James Horatio Gottheil", "content": "\n Richard James Horatio Gottheil (13 October 1862 \u2013 22 May 1936) was an English American Semitic scholar, Zionist, and founding father of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.[1]\n He was born in Manchester, England, but moved to the United States at age 11 when his father, Gustav Gottheil, accepted a position as the assistant Rabbi of the largest Reform synagogue in New York, Temple Emanu-El. He graduated from Columbia College in 1881, and studied also in Europe, earning his doctorate at the University of Leipzig in 1886.\n From 1898 to 1904 he was president of the American Federation of Zionists, and worked with both Stephen S. Wise and Jacob De Haas as organizational secretaries. Though he was ever desirous of returning to the quiet life of academia, Gottheil attended the Second Zionist Congress in Basel, establishing relationships with Theodor Herzl and Max Nordau.[2] \"Professor Gottheil shunned publicity; he did not mind the trickles of adulation accorded him as President; but his official duties irked him beyond endurance. He hated to preside at meetings. He was careless in procedural matters and embarrassed by ceremonies in which he had to take part. He was horrified by emotional debates. He felt that his status as a professor was being sullied by his being President of a propaganda organization. He ran away from official duties. He usually limited his official addresses at Zionist meetings to the necessary items, speaking briefly. He became more and more nerve-provoked by his status, especially as the practical affairs of the Zionist Federation made no visible progress.\"[3] Gottheil virtually vanished from the Zionist movement for the rest of his life. He continued writing and supporting the Zionist effort, but he never again undertook a leadership role.\n After 1904 he was vice president of the American Jewish Historical Society. Gottheil wrote many articles on Oriental and Jewish questions for newspapers and reviews. He edited the Columbia University Oriental Series, and the Semitic Study Series. After 1901 he was one of the editors of the Jewish Encyclopedia. He has written the chapter on Zionism which was translated into Arabic and published by Najib Nassar in his newspaper Al-Karmil and also in the form of a book in 1911.[4][5]\n He died on 22 May 1936.\n ", "tags": ["1862 births", "1936 deaths", "19th-century American male writers", "19th-century English male writers", "20th-century American male writers", "20th-century English male writers", "American Hebraists", "American male non-fiction writers", "American political writers", "American Reform Jews", "American Zionists", "British Hebraists", "British Jews", "British Reform Jews", "British Zionists", "Burials at Salem Fields Cemetery", "College fraternity founders", "Columbia College (New York) alumni", "Contributors to the Jewish Encyclopedia", "English emigrants to the United States", "English Jewish writers", "English male non-fiction writers", "English orientalists", "English political writers", "Jewish American writers", "Leipzig University alumni", "New York Public Library people", "Semiticists", "Writers from Manchester", "Zeta Beta Tau", "Use dmy dates from December 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with infoboxes completely from Wikidata", "Articles using Template Infobox person Wikidata", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Articles with LibriVox links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with TDV\u0130A identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nRichard James Horatio GottheilBorn13 October 1862\u00a0Died22 May 1936\u00a0 (aged 73)\nRichard James Horatio Gottheil (13 October 1862 \u2013 22 May 1936) was an English American Semitic scholar, Zionist, and founding father of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Publications\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nHe was born in Manchester, England, but moved to the United States at age 11 when his father, Gustav Gottheil, accepted a position as the assistant Rabbi of the largest Reform synagogue in New York, Temple Emanu-El.
