He completed numerous designs for hotels, courthouses and other major buildings in Boston, Massachusetts, and New York City, New York, before that relocation.\n He was appointed in 1863 as the Supervising Architect of the United States, serving into 1865; the position was then attached to the Department of the Treasury. He also practiced in Mobile, Alabama after the American Civil War.\n Rogers was born in Marshfield, Massachusetts to Isaac Rogers, a farmer and shipwright, and his wife Hannah Ford. In 1823 he married Emily Wesley Tobey of Portland, Maine. The couple had eight children, four of whom survived infancy. Two of his sons followed him into the profession of architecture.\n Rogers was a student of Solomon Willard. He became one of the country's foremost hotel architects and was renowned for Boston's Tremont House (the first hotel with indoor plumbing), the Astor House in New York City, and the Exchange Hotel in Richmond, Virginia. He designed the Burnett House in Cincinnati, then the largest and most elegant hotel in the Midwest. He also designed New York's Astor Opera House (1847).\n With William Keeley, Rogers designed The Cathedral of the Assumption, Louisville, Kentucky in the Neo-Gothic style. Upon its completion in 1852, the 287-foot spire was North America's tallest.\n His design for the fourth Hamilton County, Ohio Hamilton County Courthouse was for a massive three-story building, measuring 190 feet square. The building bore a close resemblance to Rogers' Merchants Exchange building, Wall Street in New York City. He also designed the Boston Merchants Exchange.\n Rogers was the supervising architect, the last of five, who worked upon the Ohio Statehouse. He completed the building in 1861.\n in 1853 Rogers founded an architecture firm in Louisville, Kentucky with another architect named Henry Whitestone. That firm was originally named Rogers, Whitestone & Co., Architects.[1] It is still practicing today under the name of Luckett & Farley Architects, Engineers, & Interior Designers.\n From 1863 to 1865, due to his friendship with fellow Cincinnatian Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, Rogers was appointed as Supervising Architect of the United States. In this role he designed and patented four burglar-proof vaults built in the northwest corner of the U.S. Treasury Building in 1864. Their lining consisted of two layers of cast iron balls interposed between the traditional alternating plates of wrought iron and hardened steel. The balls, held loosely in specially formed cavities, were designed to rotate freely upon contact with a drill, or any other tool, thereby preventing a burglar from penetrating. The design was first used for two vaults built in the New York Sub-Treasury in 1862 (this building is now use as Federal Hall National Memorial). Similar vaults were built in custom houses in Detroit, Cincinnati, and Chicago.\n Thomas Gaff House (Hillforest)\n Merchant's Exchange, Boston (1852)\n The Captain Robert Bennet Forbes House\n Ohio Statehouse\n Merchants Exchange building, Wall Street (National City Bank Building)\n Tremont House, Boston, Massachusetts\n \n ", "tags": ["1800 births", "1869 deaths", "People from Marshfield, Massachusetts", "19th-century American architects", "Architects from Massachusetts", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Not to be confused with Isaiah Rodgers.\nAmerican architect\nIsaiah RogersBorn(1800-08-17)August 17, 1800Marshfield, MADiedApril 13, 1869(1869-04-13) (aged\u00a068)NationalityNorth AmericanOccupationArchitectBuildingsOhio Statehouse, New York Merchants Exchange\n\nIsaiah Rogers (August 17, 1800 \u2013 April 13, 1869) was a U.S. architect from Massachusetts who eventually moved his practice south, where he was based in Louisville, Kentucky, and Cincinnati, Ohio.
