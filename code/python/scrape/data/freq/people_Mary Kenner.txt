{"name": "Mary Kenner", "content": "Mary Beatrice Davidson Kenner (May 17, 1912 \u2013 January 13, 2006) was an American inventor most noted for her development of the sanitary belt, however due to racial discrimination her patent for the sanitary belt was prevented for thirty years.[1] Kenner received five patents, which includes a carrier attachment for invalid walker and bathroom tissue holder.  \n Kenner was born in Monroe North Carolina, and came from a family of inventors. At a very young age, Kenner had an active, inventive mind that would often keep her up at night. Her father, whom she credited for her initial interest in discovery, was Sidney Nathaniel Davidson (June 1890-November 1958).[2] In his lifetime, he patented a clothing press which would fit in suitcases, though he ultimately made no money on the invention.[3] Her father also patented a window washer for trains and invented a stretcher with wheels for ambulances.[1] Her grandfather invented a light signal for trains, though this invention was stolen from him by a white man.[1] Her sister, Mildred Davidson Austin Smith (1916\u20131993), invented and commercially sold board games.[3]\n Kenner graduated from high school in 1931. She attended Howard University, although she was unable to finish due to financial difficulties.[4]Kenner did not receive any college degree or professional training. Women at the time were kept out of scientific establishments or academic institutions, but this did not prevent women from continued to put their efforts toward their accomplishments. [5]\n Kenner and her family moved to Washington D.C. when she was young and here is where she stayed to keep updating on her opportunities to have her ideas patented at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.[6]\n She invented an adjustable sanitary belt with an inbuilt, moisture-proof napkin pocket. Also known as a menstrual pad that women find very useful today. In 1956, she was finally able to save up enough money to get her first patent on it.[3][4] However, the company that first showed interest in her invention, the Sonn-Nap-Pack Company, rejected it after they discovered that she was African American.[7][4][1] Kenner never made any money off of the sanitary belt, because her patent expired and became public domain, allowing it to be manufactured freely.[1]\n A quote from Marry Kenner, \"one day I was contacted by a company that expressed an interest in marketing my idea. I was jubilant,\" she said in an interview. \"I saw houses, cars, and everything about to come to my way.\" A representative made their way to Washington to speak with Kenner and she continues to explain that they had rejected her by saying, \"Sorry to say, when they found out I was black, their interest dropped. The representative went back to New York and informed me the company was no longer interested.\"[8]\n Between 1956 and 1987 she received five total patents for her household and personal item creations.[9] She shared the patent on the toilet tissue holder with her sister, Mildred Davidson. [10]She also held a patent on a back washer that could be mounted on the shower or bathtub wall.[10] This invention was patented in 1987 patent number 4696068.[10] She also patented the carrier attachment for a walker in 1959, after Mildred developed multiple sclerosis.\n Mary Kenner worked as a professional floral arranger and had four flower shops scattered around the Washington, DC, area.[11][1] She worked in her stores for a total of 23 years[1] \nafter dropping out of college due to financial difficulties. During World War II, Mary found a job with the federal government, working for the Census Bureau and General Accounting Office. She would chaperone younger women to attend military base dances in Washington, D.C. One night while chaperoning, Kenner met and fell in love with a soldier and married in 1945, and divorced in 1950.[12]In 1951, Kenner was married to renowned heavyweight boxer James \"Jabbo\" Kenner. Together, they lived in McLean, Virginia, near the Kennedy's complex. They were foster parents to five boys.[1]\n ", "tags": ["African-American inventors", "Women inventors", "1912 births", "2006 deaths", "20th-century American inventors", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards"], "raw": "US inventor\nMary  Beatrice Davidson KennerBorn17 May 1912Monroe, North CarolinaDiedJanuary 13, 2006 (aged 93) Sibley Memorial Hospital, Washington, D.C., United StatesNationalityUnited States of AmericaOccupationFloristKnown\u00a0forsinging, inventionsParent(s)Sidney Nathaniel Davidson\nMary Beatrice Davidson Kenner (May 17, 1912 \u2013 January 13, 2006) was an American inventor most noted for her development of the sanitary belt, however due to racial discrimination her patent for the sanitary belt was prevented for thirty years.[1] Kenner received five patents, which includes a carrier attachment for invalid walker and bathroom tissue holder.  \n\n The Sanitary Belt\nContents\n\n1 Early Life & Education\n2 Inventions\n3 Personal life\n4 References\n5 Further reading\n\n\nEarly Life & Education[edit]\nKenner was born in Monroe North Carolina, and came from a family of inventors.
