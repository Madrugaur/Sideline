{"name": "Thomas Sopwith", "content": "\n Sir Thomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith, CBE, Hon FRAeS (18 January 1888\u00a0\u2013 27 January 1989) was an English aviation pioneer, business executive and yachtsman.\n Sopwith was born in Kensington, London on 18 January 1888. He was the eighth child and only son of Thomas Sopwith (a civil engineer and managing director of the Spanish Lead Mines Company, Linares, Ja\u00e9n, Spain) and his wife Lydia Gertrude n\u00e9e Messiter.[1] He was a grandson of mining engineer Thomas Sopwith.[2] He was educated at Cottesmore School in Hove and at Seafield Park engineering college in Hill Head.[3]\n When he was ten years old, on 30 July 1898 whilst on a family holiday on the Isle of Lismore, near Oban in Scotland, a gun lying across young Thomas's knee went off, killing his father. This accident haunted Sopwith for the rest of his life.[1]\n Sopwith was interested in motor cycles, and took part in the 100-mile Tricar trial in 1904 where he was one of four medal winners.[4] He also tried hot air ballooning, his first ascent being in C.S. Rolls' balloon in June 1906.[5] Together with Phil Paddon he bought his own hot air balloon from Short Brothers.[5] For a while he was in business with Phil Paddon selling automobiles as Paddon & Sopwith, Albemarle Street, Piccadilly, London.[5]\n In his youth, he was an expert ice skater and played in goal during Princes Ice Hockey Club's 1908 match with C. P. P. Paris and during the 1909\u201310 season.[6] He was also a member of the Great Britain national ice hockey team that won the gold medal at the first European Championships in 1910.[7]\n Sopwith became interested in flying after seeing John Moisant flying the first cross-Channel passenger flight. His first flight was with Gustave Blondeau in a Farman at Brooklands. He soon taught himself to fly on a Howard Wright Avis monoplane and took to the air on his own for the first time on 22 October 1910.  He crashed after travelling about 300 yards (275 m), but soon improved, and on 22 November was awarded Royal Aero Club Aviation Certificate No. 31, flying a Howard Wright 1910 Biplane.\n On 18 December 1910, Sopwith won a \u00a34000 prize for the longest flight from England to the Continent in a British-built aeroplane, flying 169\u00a0miles (272\u00a0km) in 3 hours 40 minutes. He used the winnings to set up the Sopwith School of Flying at Brooklands.\n In June 1912 Sopwith, along with Fred Sigrist and others, set up the Sopwith Aviation Company, initially at Brooklands.[8] On 24 October 1912 using a Wright Model B completely rebuilt by Sopwith and fitted with an ABC 40\u00a0hp engine,[9] Harry Hawker took the British Michelin Endurance prize with a flight of 8h 23m. Sopwith Aviation got its first military aircraft order in November 1912, and in December moved to larger premises in Kingston upon Thames. The company produced more than 18,000\u00a0World War I aircraft for the allied forces, including 5747 of the Sopwith Camel single-seat fighter. Sopwith was awarded the CBE in 1918.\n Bankrupted after the war by punitive anti-profiteering taxes, he re-entered the aviation business in 1920 with a new firm named after his chief engineer and test pilot, Harry Hawker. Sopwith became chairman of the new firm, Hawker Aircraft.\n He became a Knight Bachelor in 1953. After the nationalisation in 1977 of the aviation interests of what was by then Hawker Siddeley, he continued to work as a consultant to the company until 1980.\n In 1979, Sopwith was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.[10]\n His authorised biography is Pure Luck (2005) by Alan Bramson, with a foreword by the Prince of Wales (ISBN\u00a01-85260-263-5). Sir Thomas was interviewed on 8 November 1978 by the art historian Anna Malinovska. The interview is reproduced in Voices in Flight, 2006.\n He was a member of the Air Squadron flying club.\n Sopwith challenged the America's Cup with his J-class yachts, Endeavour, in 1934, and with Endeavour II in 1937.  Both yachts were designed by Charles E. Nicholson.  Sopwith funded, organised and helmed the yachts.  He did not win the Cup but he became a Cup legend by nearly winning it in 1934.  He was inducted into the America's Cup Hall of Fame in 1995.\n In 1927 Sopwith commissioned yacht builders Camper and Nicholsons to build a luxury motor yacht he named Vita. She was sold in 1929 to Sir John Shelley-Rolls who renamed her Alastor.[11] During World War II the Royal Navy commandeered her to ferry provisions to Navy vessels moored at the entrance to Strangford Lough.  In 1946 a fire gutted her and she sank in Ringhaddy Sound in Strangford Lough.[12]\n In 1937 Sopwith received the yacht Philante, also built for him by Camper and Nicholsons.  During the War the ship was requisitioned by the Royal Navy and used as a convoy escort vessel, HMS Philante. After the war the vessel was returned to Sopwith and he sold her to Norway in 1947, to be used as a royal yacht for the Norwegian king.\n Sopwith married Beatrice Hore-Ruthven (1871\u20131930) in 1914; they had no children. Beatrice was the daughter of Walter Hore-Ruthven, who in 1919 was created Baron Ruthven of Gowrie. After Beatrice's death, in 1932 he married Phyllis Brodie Gordon (1892\u20131978); their son Thomas Edward Brodie Sopwith had success in car racing.\n Sopwith's house in Mayfair, No. 46 Green Street, where he lived from 1934 until 1940, has a blue plaque.[13] In 1940 he moved to Warfield Hall in Berkshire which he had acquired the previous year.[14]\n Sopwith's 100th birthday was marked by a flypast of military aircraft over his home, Compton Manor in King's Somborne, Hampshire.[citation needed]  He died in Hampshire on 27 January 1989, aged 101.  His grave and that of his second wife Phyllis Brodie can be found in the grounds of the 11th-century All Saints Church at Little Somborne near Winchester.\n A bronze bust of Sopwith was unveiled by his son at Kingston Library, London, on 26 September 2014. The sculptor was Ambrose Barber, a former executive of Hawker. Earlier in the same year, a plaque was unveiled in Canbury Gardens in Kingston upon Thames by Sopwith's son commemorating the Sopwith aviation company.[15]\n Sopwith Way in Kingston upon Thames was named after Thomas Sopwith and built on the site of his company's former factory. Sopwith Road, one of the roads built on the site of the former Heston Aerodrome, is also named after him. Sopwith Road in Warfield (Bracknell, Berkshire), located close to his former home Warfield Hall and the location of the newly-built Woodhurst school (part of Warfield CE Primary School), is also named after him.\n ", "tags": ["1888 births", "1989 deaths", "America's Cup sailors", "Aviation history of the United Kingdom", "History of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames", "British centenarians", "Burials in Hampshire", "Commanders of the Order of the British Empire", "Members of the Early Birds of Aviation", "English aerospace engineers", "English aviators", "English ice hockey players", "English male sailors (sport)", "Fellows of the Royal Aeronautical Society", "Knights Bachelor", "People from Kensington", "English centenarians", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from November 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "EngvarB from August 2014", "Use dmy dates from January 2020", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from September 2018", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For other people named Thomas Sopwith, see Thomas Sopwith (disambiguation).\n\n\nSirThomas SopwithCBE, Hon FRAeSThomas Sopwith, c.\u00a01910BornThomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith(1888-01-18)18 January 1888Kensington, London United KingdomDied27 January 1989(1989-01-27) (aged\u00a0101)Hampshire, EnglandResting placeLittle SomborneOccupationAviation pioneer \u00b7 yachtsmanYears\u00a0active1910\u20131980OrganizationSopwith Aviation Company \u00b7 Hawker SiddeleySpouse(s)Beatrix Hore-Ruthven\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01914; died\u00a01930)\u200b\nPhyllis Brodie\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01932; died\u00a01978)\u200bChildrenThomas\n\nThomas Sopwith\n\nMedal record\n\n\nRepresenting  \u00a0United Kingdom \n\n\nMen's ice hockey\n\n\nEuropean Championships\n\n\n\n 1910 \nGreat Britain\n\nSir Thomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith, CBE, Hon FRAeS (18 January 1888\u00a0\u2013 27 January 1989) was an English aviation pioneer, business executive and yachtsman.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career in aviation\n3 Yachting\n4 Personal life\n5 Tributes\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nSopwith was born in Kensington, London on 18 January 1888.
