His first paper, with his fellow student and eventual long-term collaborator Alexander Kronrod in 1945, won a prize from the Moscow Mathematical Society.[1] He and Kronrod were the last students of Nikolai Luzin, and he earned his doctorate in 1949 under the supervision of Israel Gelfand.[2]\n He began working in artificial intelligence and other applied topics in the late 1950s.[1]\nAlong with Evgenii Landis, he invented the AVL tree in 1962. This was the first known balanced binary search tree data structure.[3]\n Beginning in 1963, Adelson-Velsky headed the development of a computer chess program at the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics in Moscow. His innovations included the first use of bitboards (a now-common method for representing game positions) in computer chess.[4] The program defeated Kotok-McCarthy in the first chess match between computer programs, also in 1966,[4] and it evolved into Kaissa, the first world computer chess champion.[5]\n In August 1992, Adelson-Velsky moved to Israel, and he resided in Ashdod.[1]\n Adelson-Velsky died on 26 April 2014, aged 92, in his apartment in Giv'atayim, Israel.[6]\n ", "tags": ["1922 births", "2014 deaths", "People from Samara, Russia", "Soviet Jews", "Soviet inventors", "Soviet mathematicians", "Soviet computer scientists", "Computer chess people", "Jewish scientists", "Soviet emigrants to Israel", "People from Ashdod", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Russian mathematician\nGeorgy Maximovich Adelson-Velsky (Russian: \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0301\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0301\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0410\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043e\u0301\u043d-\u0412\u0435\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439; name is sometimes transliterated as Georgii Adelson-Velskii) (8 January 1922 \u2013 26 April 2014) was a Soviet and Israeli mathematician and computer scientist.\nBorn in Samara, Adelson-Velsky was originally educated as a pure mathematician.
