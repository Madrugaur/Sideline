In the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, Racah served as deputy commander of the Israeli forces defending Mount Scopus.[5]\n Racah died at the age of 56, apparently asphyxiated by gas from a faulty heater while visiting Florence.[1]\n In 1937 Racah was appointed Professor of Physics at the University of Pisa. In 1939, after his move to Palestine, he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, He later became  Dean of the Faculty of Sciences and finally Rector and acting President from 1961 to 1962, following Benjamin Mazar and succeeded by Eliahu Eilat.[6] The physics institute at the Hebrew University is named \"The Racah Institute of Physics\".\n Racah's research was mainly in the fields of quantum physics and atomic spectroscopy. He first devised a systematic general procedure for classifying the energy levels of open shell atoms, which remains to this day the accepted technique for practical calculations of atomic structure. This formalism was described in a monograph coauthored by his cousin Ugo Fano (Irreducible Tensorial Sets, 1959).\n In 1958, Racah was awarded the Israel Prize in exact sciences.[7]\n ", "tags": ["20th-century Italian mathematicians", "Israeli physicists", "Israeli mathematicians", "Italian physicists", "Italian emigrants to Mandatory Palestine", "Italian Zionists", "20th-century Italian Jews", "University of Florence alumni", "University of Pisa faculty", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty", "Israel Prize in exact science recipients", "Israel Prize in exact science recipients who were mathematicians", "Israel Prize in exact science recipients who were physicists", "Members of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "Scientists from Florence", "1909 births", "1965 deaths", "Jewish physicists", "Presidents of universities in Israel", "Italian refugees", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from October 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Giulio RacahBornFebruary 9, 1909Florence, ItalyDiedAugust 28, 1965\u00a0(1965-08-29) (aged\u00a056)Florence, Italy\n Giulio Racah\n The Racah Institute of Physics at the Hebrew University Givat Ram campus in Jerusalem\nGiulio (Yoel) Racah (Hebrew: \u05d2'\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 (\u05d9\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc) \u05e8\u05e7\u05d7\u200e;  February 9, 1909 \u2013 August 28, 1965) was an Italian\u2013Israeli physicist and mathematician.[1] He was Acting President of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1961 to 1962.[2]\nThe crater Racah on the Moon is named after him.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Academic and scientific career\n3 Awards and recognition\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nGuilio (Yoel) Racah was born in Florence, Italy.[4] He earned his BA from the University of Florence in 1930, and continued his studies at Rome with Enrico Fermi. \nIn 1939, due to application of Anti-Jewish laws in Italy, Racah immigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine.
