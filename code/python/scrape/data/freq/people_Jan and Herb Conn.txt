They are credited with establishing many classic climbs in areas like Carderock in Maryland, Seneca Rocks in West Virginia, Cannon Cliff in New Hampshire and Black Hills of South Dakota. They are also well known as cave explorers who in the 1960s and 1970s discovered and mapped over 60 miles of Jewel Cave, making it the world\u2019s third-longest cave system.\n Both Herb and Jan were born and raised on the East Coast.[6] Jan grew up in Maryland, just outside Washington, DC in a household with two older sisters.[7] Jan loved music and played flute, classical guitar and several other instruments.[7] Herb, whose full name was Herbert William Conn,  grew up in upstate New York,[1]  in Geneva, New York,[5] and graduated from the University of Colorado.[8] Herb and Jan were first cousins, They married in 1944.[1][9][10]\n During World War II, Herb served as an electrical engineer for the Navy Department in Washington, DC.[6] Jan and Herb spent their spare time exploring the rocks surrounding Washington DC, most notably Carderock where they began climbing in 1942. They climbed and named many of the routes at Carderock, including Herbie\u2019s Horror, Jan's Face, Spider Walk and Ronnie's Leap, which was named after their dog.[11] Herbie\u2019s Horror, first climbed by Herb, was one of the first 5.9 routes in the eastern United States.[12] They also made the first documented ascents of the routes Conn's East and Conn's West at Seneca Rocks,[13] following the pitons left by the mountain troops who trained there.  In a letter to the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club Mountaineering Section the Conns describe a visit to Seneca with Don Hubbard: \"Don and the two of us climbed the south peak on a gorgeous moonlit evening, carrying sleeping bags, and spent the night on the narrow summit ridge. Don woke up in the night to see the lower half of Jan\u2019s bag flapping over the edge. But Jan was safely curled up in the top half, still anchored to a piton in the rock.\"[13]  In 1944 they started publishing \"Up Rope\" magazine, which became the official newsletter of the Mountaineering Section of the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC).[2][14][15]\n In 1946, Herb was discharged from the US Army and the Conns began a five-year period of traveling and climbing around the US with short forays into Canada and Mexico. They became pioneers of what is now praisingly referred to as dirtbag climbing, which they described in the We work in our spare time article:[16] \"it is a simple matter of mathematics - two people working six months a year are just as good as one person working twelve months to support two people\".  They lived in a self-equipped camper converted from a ten-year-old \"panel delivery truck\".[16][17] For several years they worked odd jobs and climbed at many locations from Yosemite in California to Mount Katahdin in Maine, making scattered first ascents along the way in places like Cannon Cliff in New Hampshire, Santa Catalina Mountains and Monument Valley in Arizona, Zion National Park in Utah, and Big Bend National Park in Texas.\n Herb and Jan usually sought the easiest and most direct routes to the top of the most striking rock formations. Before the development of specialized climbing shoes, harnesses, and protection - like nuts and cams, they climbed in cheap smooth-soled tennis shoes with 80-foot laid nylon rope tied around their waists and used US Army  pitons scavenged at Seneca Rocks after World War II.[18][19] They used body belays and down-climbed their routes instead of rappelling if it was not possible to walk-off. In spite of this they established many routes that would be challenging or even terrifying to today's climbers.[20]\n In 1947 on a trip to climb Devils Tower,[7][21] the Conns passed through the Black Hills of South Dakota.  It was then that they discovered the Needles, with a seemingly unlimited quantity of excellent climbing.  They settled in the Black Hills where they made around 220 first ascents in the Needles and published a climbing guidebook to the area.  With no other climbers in the area they felt, as Herb put it, \"like a couple of cats in an untended fish market.\"[19][22][23]\n In 1949 they bought 20 acres in the Custer area and adjacent to the Needles.[1][16][21] A couple years after that they built a small, rustic stone home they called Conncave where they lived off the grid, without running water or electricity, for the next 60 years.[24][25] To help finance their climbing and later caving adventures they created customized leather[26] and wood products. In addition, each fall for 13 years Herb spent a week[2] doing maintenance work filling in cracks on the four faces of Mount Rushmore,[1][8][13][18] and Jan taught guitar and flute.\n In 1959, geologist, mountaineer and caver Dwight Deal had done some exploration in a small cave called Jewel Cave, a little known monument in the National Park System. He needed some companions who might help him continue his exploration trips there and turned to his friends, Herb and Jan. He asked if they would be interested in grubbing around underground and, after thinking it over, they replied they would try it \"once\". That one trip turned into a passion of exploring Jewel Cave that lasted for over 22 years, and took over 6,000 volunteer hours on 700 trips.[24] From 1959 to 1979, Herb and Jan mapped 62.36 miles of the interior of Jewel Cave.[6][11] The Conns discovered what is now the Scenic Cave Tour route in 1961. The National Park Service was intrigued by their reports of high, narrow passageways, huge rooms and unusual speleothems (cave decorations) and opened a new tour route.  In addition to assisting with the construction of this trail, Herb also designed the lighting system and dramatic placement of lights still in use today. The cave winds that enticed the explorers further into the cave fascinated Herb, and in 1966 he produced an important scientific paper explaining reasons for these barometric winds. The Conn's book, \"The Jewel Cave Adventure,\" serves not only as a record of their years of cave exploration here, but as an exciting tale of adventure even for non-cavers.\n In years 1963-1965, when exploration trips into Jewel Cave were restricted, the Conns joined David Schnute exploring Wind Cave. In 1963 the trio found new passages breaking away from the known portion of the cave and allowing them to discover, name, and survey 15,740 feet of virgin passage.[29][30] They largely retired from caving by the early 1980s.\n Jan's musical play, Run to Catch a Pine Cone, has been performed throughout the country.[1] She is also an accomplished rubber stamp artist.[32][33]\nIn a 2008 interview for Climbing Magazine they stated \"I know sometimes people think we had this high dream of living like this, in a place like this \u2026 it wasn\u2019t that way. We just kept backing away from the things we didn\u2019t like. This is where we landed.\"[4] In a 2008 talk, Jan said that they no longer climb rocks, but still enjoy the outdoors. She said, \"Fortunately, the slower we move the more we see.[7]\n In summer of 1985, Herb and Jan Conn were awarded the Conservation Service Award by the Secretary of the Interior, Don Hodel.[11]\n On September 17, 2011, Herb and Jan were inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame in recognition of their pioneering exploration.[13][18][34] Soon afterward Herb's health failed and on February 1, 2012, he died in sleep in his home near Custer, at the age of 91.[18][24]\n Herb was also an amateur mathematician.[35]\n First ascents are marked by FA.\n Exit chimney on Diagonal Traverse\n Surmounting the pillar\n ", "tags": ["American rock climbers", "American mountain climbers", "1921 births", "2012 deaths", "American cavers", "People from Custer, South Dakota", "People from the East Coast of the United States", "Harv and Sfn multiple-target errors", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "No local image but image on Wikidata", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-LCCN identifiers"], "raw": "For the Canadian geneticist and poet, see Jan Conn.
