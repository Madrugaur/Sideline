{"name": "Allen B. Rosenstein", "content": "Allen Bertram Rosenstein (August 25, 1920 \u2013 February 23, 2018[1][2]) was an American systems engineer, Professor Emeritus of Systems Engineering at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), and IEEE Fellow awarded for his contributions to the \"theory, design, and manufacture of power converters and for leadership and research in engineering education\".[3]\n Born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, Rosenstein received his BA in Electrical Engineering in 1940 from the University of Arizona. After his military service in the U.S. Navy, he received his MA in 1950 and his PhD in 1958, both in Engineering from UCLA.[3] He was Professor of Systems Engineering at UCLA for almost four decades.\n In industry Rosenstein started eventually five companies for design and manufacturing of specific automatic controls and electro-magnetic system devices, starting with Pioneer Magnetics, Inc. in 1957.[4] He received five different patents on Electro-Magnetic systems, consulted multiple professional organizations on electric power system, and participated in Presidential Committees and Conferences under Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.[5]\n Rosenstein's research in engineering education started with his participation in an ongoing UCLA Ford Foundation funded study from 1955 to 1968 in the interrelation of professions, technology and national policy, where he became principal investigator. This research defined the \"indispensable societal role and responsibility of the collective professions\", and predicted an \"ever-eroding U.S. industrial base and recognized the legislative, structural and institutional deficiencies that have ensured the over 50-year continuing decline of America's economic, financial, trade, technological and manufacturing leadership\". This eventually lead to Rosenstein's involvement in the proposal of the \"National Technology Foundation Act\", which was discussed in US Congress and subcommittee on Science, Research and Technology in the 1970s and 1980s.[5] In the 1970s Rosenstein had also been consultant in educational planning in Venezuela for UNESCO.[4]\n Rosenstein is awarded for his Lifetime Achievement by the University of Arizona, College of Engineering, and received the Fellow Award by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.[5]\n Books, a selection:[5][6]\n ", "tags": ["1920 births", "2018 deaths", "Military personnel from Baltimore", "American engineers", "Fellow Members of the IEEE", "Systems engineers", "University of Arizona alumni", "UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science alumni", "UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science faculty", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Allen Bertram Rosenstein (August 25, 1920 \u2013 February 23, 2018[1][2]) was an American systems engineer, Professor Emeritus of Systems Engineering at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), and IEEE Fellow awarded for his contributions to the \"theory, design, and manufacture of power converters and for leadership and research in engineering education\".[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Publications\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nBorn and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, Rosenstein received his BA in Electrical Engineering in 1940 from the University of Arizona.
