Guttman received both his BA in 1936 and MA in 1939 at the University of Minnesota, and his PhD in Social and Psychological Measurement in 1942.\n From 1941 to 1947 Guttman was professor of sociology at Cornell University, while as part of the World War II effort, he also served as an Expert Consultant to the US Army's Research Branch. In 1947 Guttman and his wife Ruth emigrated to Palestine.\n He founded and was the scientific director of the Israel Institute of Applied Social Research, later renamed the Guttman Institute before finally becoming the Guttman Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research.[citation needed]\n He was member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and foreign Honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and President of the Psychometric Society. In 1956 he was elected a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. In 1962 he received the Rothschild Prize.

Notably, Guttman first proved several fundamental theorems in matrix algebra, as discussed in papers by Hubert, Meulman and Heiser (2000)[6] and Takane and Yanai (2005). Several of Guttman's contributions, such as  Smallest Space Analysis (SSA), have been incorporated into computer packages.\n Guttman was described[by whom?] as a brilliant innovator who \"saw theory in method and method in theory\", was \"informed by high sophistication in mathematics, statistics, sociology and psychology\", and one who \"made a major contribution to democratic policy-making in the new state\" and \"was concerned with the 'well-being' of individuals, groups and society\".[7][verification needed]\n Guttman published in numerous journals and books, including over 300 pages in Psychometrika.  Many of his papers are still quoted in the scientific literature as being relevant and important to current statistical and mathematical advances.\n His innovative methodological work on attitudes was published in the 4th volume of Studies in Social Psychology in World War II (more popularly called The American Soldier series, after the title of the first two volumes).\n Further Reading\n Shye, S.
