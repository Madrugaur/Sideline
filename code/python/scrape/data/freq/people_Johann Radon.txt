{"name": "Johann Radon", "content": "\n Johann Karl August Radon (16 December 1887 \u2013 25 May 1956) was an Austrian mathematician. His doctoral dissertation was on the calculus of variations (in 1910, at the University of Vienna).\n Radon[1] was born in Tetschen, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary, now D\u011b\u010d\u00edn, Czech Republic. He received his doctoral degree at the University of Vienna in 1910. He spent the winter semester 1910/11 at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, then he was an assistant at the German Technical University in Brno, and from 1912 to 1919 at the Technical University of Vienna. In 1913/14, he passed his habilitation at the University of Vienna. Due to his near-sightedness, he was exempt from the draft during wartime.\n In 1919, he was called to become Professor extraordinarius at the newly founded University of Hamburg; in 1922, he became Professor ordinarius at the University of Greifswald, and in 1925 at the University of Erlangen. Then he was Ordinarius at the University of Breslau from 1928 to 1945.\n After a short stay at the University of Innsbruck he became Ordinarius at the Institute of Mathematics of the University of Vienna on 1 October 1946. In 1954/55, he was rector of the University of Vienna.\n In 1939, Radon became corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and in 1947, he became a member. From 1952 to 1956, he was Secretary of the Class of Mathematics and Science of this Academy. From 1948 to 1950, he was president of the Austrian Mathematical Society.\n Johann Radon married Maria Rigele, a secondary school teacher, in 1916. They had three sons who died young or very young. Their daughter Brigitte, born in 1924, obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Innsbruck and married the Austrian mathematician Erich Bukovics in 1950. Brigitte lives in Vienna.\n Radon, as Curt C. Christian described him in 1987 at the occasion of the unveiling of his brass bust at the University of Vienna, was a friendly, good-natured man, highly esteemed by  students and colleagues alike, a noble personality. He did make the impression of a quiet scholar, but he was also sociable and willing to celebrate. He loved music, and he played music with friends at home, being an excellent violinist himself, and a good singer. His love for classical literature lasted through all his life.\n In 2003, the Austrian Academy of Sciences founded an Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics and named it after Johann Radon (see the external link below).\n Radon is known for a number of lasting contributions, including:\n ", "tags": ["1887 births", "1956 deaths", "People from D\u011b\u010d\u00edn", "Austrian mathematicians", "20th-century mathematicians", "University of Greifswald faculty", "University of Vienna alumni", "TU Wien faculty", "University of Hamburg faculty", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg faculty", "University of Breslau faculty", "University of Innsbruck faculty", "University of Vienna faculty", "Rectors of universities in Austria", "Variational analysts", "Functional analysts", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Use dmy dates from March 2021", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Biography with signature", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nAustrian mathematician\nJohann RadonRadon in c. 1920Born16 December 1887D\u011b\u010d\u00edn, Bohemia, Austria-HungaryDied25 May 1956(1956-05-25) (aged\u00a068)Vienna, AustriaNationalityAustrianAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Vienna, AustriaKnown\u00a0forRadon\u2013Hurwitz numberRadon\u2013Nikodym theoremRadon measureRadon's theoremRadon transformSpouse(s)Maria Rigele (m. 1916)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of Vienna, AustriaUniversity of Hamburg, GermanyUniversity of Greifswald, GermanyUniversity of Erlangen, GermanyUniversity of Breslau, Germany (now University of Wroc\u0142aw, Poland)Doctoral advisorGustav Ritter von Escherich\nSignature\nJohann Karl August Radon (16 December 1887 \u2013 25 May 1956) was an Austrian mathematician.
