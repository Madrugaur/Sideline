{"name": "Jack Cover", "content": "John \"Jack\" Higson Cover Jr. (April 6, 1920 \u2013 February 7, 2009) was the inventor of the Taser stun gun.[1]\n Cover was born in New York City on April 6, 1920, and grew up in Chicago.[1] His father was a professor of economics. His mother earned a mathematics master's degree at the University of Chicago.[2] Cover earned a bachelor's degree and a doctorate in nuclear physics at the same university,[1] studying under Enrico Fermi.[3] During World War II, he was an Army Air Force test pilot. He later worked at the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. He was a scientist at North American Aviation from 1952 until 1964 and also worked for NASA[3] (Apollo program), IBM and Hughes Aircraft.[1]\n In 1970, he formed Taser Systems, Inc., named for a Tom Swift novel about the Thomas A. Swift's Electric Rifle. Because the Taser used gunpowder to launch the darts, the federal government considered it a firearm, a classification that ruled out a civilian market and also discouraged police and military sales.[1]\n Cover was married three times, the first two ended in divorce. His last marriage was to Ginny. He had five children, two sons and three daughters.[2] He had Alzheimer's disease, and died of pneumonia on February 7, 2009 at the Golden West Retirement Home in Mission Viejo, California.[1][2][4]\n ", "tags": ["1920 births", "2009 deaths", "American nuclear physicists", "Deaths from pneumonia", "Infectious disease deaths in California", "Scientists from New York City", "Taser", "20th-century American inventors", "People with Alzheimer's disease", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American physicist\nJohn Higson Cover Jr.BornJohn Higson Cover(1920-04-06)April 6, 1920New York CityDiedFebruary 7, 2009(2009-02-07) (aged\u00a088)Mission Viejo, CaliforniaOther\u00a0namesJack CoverKnown\u00a0forTaser inventorSpouse(s)GinnyChildren4\nJohn \"Jack\" Higson Cover Jr. (April 6, 1920 \u2013 February 7, 2009) was the inventor of the Taser stun gun.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Private life\n\n\n2 Patents\n3 See also\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nCover was born in New York City on April 6, 1920, and grew up in Chicago.[1] His father was a professor of economics.
