{"name": "Thomas Rickman", "content": "\n Thomas Rickman (8 June 1776\u00a0\u2013 4 January 1841) was an English architect and architectural antiquary who was a major figure in the Gothic Revival. He is particularly remembered for his Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture (1817), which established the basic chronological classification and terminology that are still in widespread use for the different styles of English medieval ecclesiastical architecture.\n Rickman was born on 8 June 1776 at Maidenhead, Berkshire, into a large Quaker family. He avoided the medical career envisaged for him by his father, a grocer and druggist, and instead went into business for himself. He married his first cousin Lucy Rickman in 1804, a marriage that estranged him from the Quakers.[1]\n The failure of his business dealings in London and the death of his first wife left Rickman despondent: the long walks into the countryside that he took for his state of mind were the beginning of his first, antiquarian interest in church architecture.  All his spare time was spent in sketching and making careful measured drawings,[2] and classifying medieval architecture, at first through its window tracery, into the sequence that he labelled \"Norman\" \"Early English\", \"Decorated English\" and \"Perpendicular English\", names that have remained in use, which he was already employing in his diaries[a] in 1811; he gained a knowledge of architecture which was very remarkable at a time when little taste existed for the beauties of the Gothic styles. In 1811 alone he is said to have studied three thousand ecclesiastical buildings.[2] In September that year he gave the first of a series of lectures on medieval architecture at the small Philosophical Society of Liverpool, which he had joined. In around 1812 he wrote an essay on Chester Cathedral, which was published posthumously in 1864.[3][4]\n The first publication to appear during his lifetime was an article on Gothic architecture for Smith's Panorama of Arts and Sciences (Liverpool). This was separately published in 1817 as An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation,[5] the first systematic treatise on Gothic architecture and a milestone in the Gothic Revival. It ran through many editions and provided the basis of Rickman's public reputation. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1829.\n Norman\n Early English\n Decorated\n Perpendicular\n As an architect, Rickman was self-taught. In 1812 he met John Cragg an ironmaster based in Liverpool, and they collaborated on the design of three churches that made extensive use of cast iron: St. George's Church, Everton; St. Michael's Church, Aigburth; and St Philip's Church (since demolished) in Hardman Street.[3][7]\n When in the Church Building Act of 1818 a large grant of money was set by the government to build new \"Waterloo churches\", Rickman sent in a design of his own which was successful in an open competition; thus he was fairly launched upon the profession of an architect, for which his natural gifts strongly fitted him. Rickman then moved to Birmingham where he designed the St George's Church (demolished in 1960) for the city.[2] The design also consisted of churchyard gates, completed in 1822, which remain today.[8] By 1830 Rickman had become one of the most successful architects of his time. He built churches at Hampton Lucy, Ombersley, and Stretton-on-Dunsmore, St George's at Birmingham, St Philip's, St Mary the Virgin and St Matthew's in Bristol, two in Carlisle, St Peter's and St Paul's at Preston, St David's in Glasgow, Grey Friars at Coventry, St Michael's Church, Aigburth and many others. He also designed New Court of St John's College, Cambridge, a palace for the bishop of Carlisle, and several large country houses.[2]\n Rickman attracted a large share of the Church Building Commission's patronage in the new churches built in the West Midlands pursuant to the Church Building Act of 1818. Rickman's transitional Gothic style, that later designers looked down on as \"Church Commissioners' Gothic\",[7] did not stand the more rigorous scrutiny of better-informed historicists in the age of photography. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, \"[his churches] are all in the Gothic style, but show more knowledge of the outward form of the medieval style than any real acquaintance with its spirit, and are little better than dull copies of old work, disfigured by much poverty of detail.\"[2] A later, more generous critic, Sir Howard Colvin, has remarked \"He was no ecclesiologist. If the detailing of his buildings was unusually scholarly, the planning remained Georgian, and the total effect of most of his churches is thin and brittle, if by no means unattractive.\"[9] Rickman nevertheless played an important part in the revival of taste for medievalism, perhaps second only to Pugin.[2]\n Henry Hutchinson partnered with Rickman in December 1821 and formed a practice called Rickman and Hutchinson. Rickman remained in this practice until Hutchinson's death in 1831.[10]\n Rickman was married three times: first to his cousin, Lucy Rickman of Lewes; secondly to Christiana Hornor; and thirdly to Elizabeth Miller of Edinburgh, by whom he had a son, the architect Thomas Miller Rickman (1827\u20131912), and a daughter.[2] He was a Quaker for most of his life. Though officially estranged after his first marriage, he continued to attend meetings, and was re-admitted prior to his second marriage.[1] Late in his life, he became a member of the Catholic Apostolic (Irvingian) Church[3]\n Rickman died at Birmingham on 4 January 1841. He was buried in the churchyard of the church he had designed: St George's Church. His tomb, designed by R. C. Hussey and completed in 1845, still stands, although the church does not.[8]\n ", "tags": ["1776 births", "1841 deaths", "People from Maidenhead", "Gothic Revival architects", "English ecclesiastical architects", "English Quakers", "Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London", "Members and Associates of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists", "English antiquarians", "English architectural historians", "19th-century antiquarians", "Architects from Berkshire", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the ODNB", "Pages using cite ODNB with id parameter", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from February 2013", "Use British English from February 2013", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "18th/19th-century English architect\nFor other people named Thomas Rickman, see Thomas Rickman (disambiguation).\n\n\nThomas RickmanBorn(1776-06-08)8 June 1776Berkshire, EnglandDied4 January 1841(1841-01-04) (aged\u00a064)Birmingham, EnglandNationalityEnglishOccupationArchitect\nThomas Rickman (8 June 1776\u00a0\u2013 4 January 1841) was an English architect and architectural antiquary who was a major figure in the Gothic Revival.
