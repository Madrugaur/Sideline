{"name": "Abraham Wald", "content": "Abraham Wald (/w\u0254\u02d0ld/; Hungarian: Wald \u00c1brah\u00e1m, Yiddish: \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd \u05d5\u05d5\u05d0\u05b7\u05dc\u05d3\u200e; (1902-10-31)31 October 1902\u00a0\u2013 (1950-12-13)13 December 1950) was a Hungarian Jewish mathematician who contributed to decision theory, geometry, and econometrics, and founded the field of statistical sequential analysis.[1] One of the well known statistical works of his during World War 2 was how to minimize the damage to bomber aircraft taking into account the survivorship bias in his calculations.[2] He spent his researching years at Columbia University.\n Wald was born on 31 October 1902 in Kolozsv\u00e1r, Transylvania, in the Kingdom of Hungary. A religious Jew, he did not attend school on Saturdays, as was required at the time by the Hungarian school system, and was thus home-schooled by his parents until college.[1] His parents were quite knowledgeable and competent as teachers.[3]\n In 1928, he graduated in mathematics from the King Ferdinand I University.[4]\nIn 1927, he entered graduate school at the University of Vienna, from which he graduated in 1931 with a Ph.D. in mathematics. His advisor there was Karl Menger.[1]\n Despite Wald's brilliance, he could not obtain a university position, because of Austrian discrimination against Jews. However, Oskar Morgenstern created a position for Wald in economics. When Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, the discrimination against Jews intensified. In particular, Wald and his family were persecuted as Jews. Wald was able to emigrate to the United States, at the invitation of the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics, to work on econometrics research.[1]\n During World War II, Wald was a member of the Statistical Research Group (SRG) at Columbia University, where he applied his statistical skills to various wartime problems.[5] These included methods of sequential analysis and sampling inspection.[6] One of the problems that the SRG worked on was to examine the distribution of damage to aircraft returning after flying missions so as to provide advice on how to minimize bomber losses to enemy fire. Wald derived a useful means of estimating the damage distribution for all aircraft that flew from the data on the damage distribution of all aircraft that returned.[7][8] His work is considered seminal in the then-fledgling discipline of operational research.\n Wald and his wife died in 1950 when the Air India plane (VT-CFK, a DC-3 aircraft[9]) in which they were travelling crashed near the Rangaswamy Pillar in northern part of the Nilgiri Mountains, in southern India, while on an extensive lecture tour at the invitation of the Indian government.[1] He had visited the Indian Statistical Institute at Calcutta and was to attend the Indian Science Congress at Bangalore in January. Their two children were back at home in the United States.[10]\n Following his death, Wald was criticized by Sir Ronald A. Fisher FRS. Fisher attacked Wald for being a mathematician without scientific experience who had written an incompetent book on statistics. Fisher particularly criticized Wald's work on the design of experiments, alleging ignorance of the basic ideas of the subject, as set out by Fisher and Frank Yates.[11] Wald's work was defended by Jerzy Neyman in the following year. Neyman explained Wald's work, particularly with respect to the design of experiments.[12]\nLucien Le Cam credits him in his own book, Asymptotic Methods in Statistical Decision Theory: \"The ideas and techniques used reflect first and foremost the influence of Abraham Wald's writings\".[13]\n Abraham Wald was the father of noted American physicist Robert Wald.\n For a complete list, see \"The Publications of Abraham Wald\", Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 23 (1): 29\u201333, 1952, doi:10.1214/aoms/1177729483\n ", "tags": ["1902 births", "1950 deaths", "Scientists from Cluj-Napoca", "Austro-Hungarian Jews", "Jewish emigrants from Austria to the United States after the Anschluss", "Presidents of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics", "Fellows of the American Statistical Association", "American statisticians", "Hungarian statisticians", "Econometricians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Columbia University faculty", "Jewish American scientists", "Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in India", "Hungarian mathematicians", "Babe\u0219-Bolyai University alumni", "University of Vienna alumni", "Mathematical economists", "Hungarian operations researchers", "Functional analysts", "American operations researchers", "20th-century economists", "Fellows of the Econometric Society", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hungarian-language text", "Articles containing Yiddish-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Abraham WaldA young WaldBorn(1902-10-31)October 31, 1902Kolozsv\u00e1r, Kingdom of HungaryDiedDecember 13, 1950(1950-12-13) (aged\u00a048)Nilgiri Mountains, IndiaNationalityHungarianAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ClujUniversity of ViennaKnown\u00a0forWald's equation  Wald test  Wald distribution  Wald\u2013Wolfowitz runs test  Wald's martingale  Wald's maximin model  Mann\u2013Wald theorem  Decision theory  Sequential analysis  Sequential probability ratio testChildrenRobert WaldScientific careerFieldsMathematics Statistics  EconomicsInstitutionsColumbia University  Cowles Commission for Research in EconomicsDoctoral advisorKarl MengerDoctoral studentsHerman ChernoffMilton Sobel  Charles Stein InfluencesOskar Morgenstern  John von Neumann  Harold Hotelling  Milton Friedman  Jerzy NeymanInfluencedAryeh Dvoretzky  Jacob Wolfowitz\nJohn Denis Sargan, Alok Bhargava\n\nAbraham Wald (/w\u0254\u02d0ld/; Hungarian: Wald \u00c1brah\u00e1m, Yiddish: \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd \u05d5\u05d5\u05d0\u05b7\u05dc\u05d3\u200e; (1902-10-31)31 October 1902\u00a0\u2013 (1950-12-13)13 December 1950) was a Hungarian Jewish mathematician who contributed to decision theory, geometry, and econometrics, and founded the field of statistical sequential analysis.[1] One of the well known statistical works of his during World War 2 was how to minimize the damage to bomber aircraft taking into account the survivorship bias in his calculations.[2] He spent his researching years at Columbia University.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and career\n2 Notable publications\n3 References\n4 Further reading\n5 External links\n\n\nLife and career[edit]\n Photograph of Abraham Wald from the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach.\nWald was born on 31 October 1902 in Kolozsv\u00e1r, Transylvania, in the Kingdom of Hungary.
