On 30 June 1912 he married Marie Kummer, who was the daughter to the mathematician Ernst Eduard Kummer[1] and  Ottilie n\u00e9e Mendelssohn (a daughter of Nathan Mendelssohn's and granddaughter of Moses Mendelssohn). Schwarz and Kummer  had six children, including his daughter Emily Schwarz.[1]\n Schwarz originally studied chemistry in Berlin but Ernst Eduard Kummer and  Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass persuaded him to change to mathematics.[2]  He received his Ph.D. from the Universit\u00e4t Berlin in 1864 and was advised by Ernst Kummer and Karl Weierstra\u00df.[3] Between 1867 and 1869 he worked at the University of Halle, then at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic.[4] From 1875 he worked at G\u00f6ttingen University,[4] dealing with the subjects of complex analysis, differential geometry and the calculus of variations. He died in Berlin.\n Schwarz's works include Bestimmung einer speziellen Minimalfl\u00e4che, which was crowned by the Berlin Academy in 1867 and printed in 1871, and Gesammelte mathematische Abhandlungen (1890).\n Among other things, Schwarz improved the proof of the Riemann mapping theorem,[5] developed a special case of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality, and gave a proof that the ball has less surface area than any other body of equal volume.[6] His work on the latter allowed \u00c9mile Picard to show solutions of differential equations exist (the Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem).[2]\n In 1892 he became a member of the Berlin Academy of Science and a professor at the University of Berlin, where his students included Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r, Paul Koebe and Ernst Zermelo.
