Holdener joined the faculty of Kenyon College in 1997, where she is currently the John B. McCoy Distinguished Teaching Chair.\n The poem Euler's Daughter by award-winning South African poet Athol Williams is dedicated to Holdener in celebration of her love of mathematics and life.[1]\n This article incorporates material from Judy Holdener on PlanetMath, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License.\n \n This article about an American mathematician is a stub.
