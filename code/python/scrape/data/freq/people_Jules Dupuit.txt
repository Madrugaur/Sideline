{"name": "Jules Dupuit", "content": "Ars\u00e8ne Jules \u00c9tienne Juvenel Dupuit (18 May 1804 \u2013 5 September 1866) was an Italian-born French civil engineer and economist.\n He was born in Fossano, Italy then under the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte. At the age of ten he emigrated to France with his family where he studied in Versailles \u2014 winning a Physics prize at graduation. He then studied in the \u00c9cole Polytechnique as a civil engineer. He gradually took on more responsibility in various regional posts. He received a L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1843 for his work on the French road system, and shortly after moved to Paris. He also studied flood management in 1848 and supervised the construction of the Paris sewer system. He died in Paris.\n Engineering questions led to his interest in economics, a subject in which he was self-taught. His 1844 article was concerned with deciding the optimum toll for a bridge. It was here that he introduced his curve of diminishing marginal utility. As the quantity of a good consumed rises, the marginal utility of the good declines for the user. So the lower the toll (lower marginal utility), the more people who would use the bridge (higher consumption). Conversely as the quantity rises (people allowed on the bridge), the willingness of a person to pay for that good (the price) declines.\n Thus, the concept of diminishing marginal utility should translate itself into a downward-sloping demand function. In this way he identified the demand curve as the marginal utility curve. This was the first time an economist had put forward a theory of demand derived from marginal utility. Although not the first time that the demand curve had been drawn, it was the first time that it had been proved rather than asserted. Dupuit, however, did not include a supply curve in his theory.\n Dupuit went on to define \"relative utility\" as the area under the demand/marginal utility curve above the price and used it as a measure of the welfare effects of different prices \u2013 concluding that public welfare is maximized when the price (or bridge toll) is zero. This was later known as Marshall's \"consumer surplus\".\n Dupuit's reputation as an economist does not rest on his advocacy of laissez-faire economics (he wrote \"Commercial Freedom\" in 1861) but on frequent contributions to periodicals. Wanting to evaluate the net economic benefit of public services, Dupuit analysed capacities for economic development, and attempted to construct a framework for utility theory and measuring the prosperity derived with public works. He also wrote on monopoly and price discrimination.\n Dupuit also considered the groundwater flow equation, which governs the flow of groundwater. He assumed that the equation could be simplified for analytical solutions by assuming that groundwater is hydrostatic and flows horizontally. This assumption is regularly used today, and is known by hydrogeologists as the Dupuit assumption.\n ", "tags": ["French chief executives", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni", "\u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech alumni", "Corps des ponts", "1804 births", "1866 deaths", "French civil engineers", "French economists", "French hydrologists", "19th-century French businesspeople", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Jules DupuitJules DupuitBorn(1804-05-18)18 May 1804Fossano, ItalyDied5 September 1866(1866-09-05) (aged\u00a062)Paris, FranceNationalityFrenchAlma\u00a0mater\u00c9cole PolytechniqueScientific careerFieldsEconomics, EngineeringInfluencedAlfred Marshall\n\nArs\u00e8ne Jules \u00c9tienne Juvenel Dupuit (18 May 1804 \u2013 5 September 1866) was an Italian-born French civil engineer and economist.\nHe was born in Fossano, Italy then under the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte.
