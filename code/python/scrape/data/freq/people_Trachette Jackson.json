{"name": "Trachette Jackson", "content": "Trachette Levon Jackson  (born July 24, 1972) is an American mathematician who is a professor of mathematics at the University of Michigan and is known for work in mathematical oncology.[1] She uses many different approaches, including continuous and discrete mathematical models, numerical simulations, and experiments to study tumor growth and treatment. Specifically, her lab is interested in \"molecular pathways associated with intratumoral angiogenesis\", \"cell-tissue interactions associated with tumor-induced angiogenesis,\" and \"tumor heterogeneity and cancer stem cells\".[2]\n Jackson's parents were in the military and traveled frequently through her childhood; as a teenager, she lived in Mesa, Arizona. There, in a summer calculus course, her talent for mathematics brought her to the attention of Arizona State University mathematics professor Joaqu\u00edn Bustoz, Jr. She went on to undergraduate studies at ASU, originally intending to study engineering, but steered to mathematics by Bustoz.[3]  From there, her interest in pure math developed into an interest in mathematical biology when she attended a talk by her future PhD advisor, James D. Murray, on the mathematics of pattern formation and, \"how the leopard got its spots.\"[4] She graduated in 1994, and earned her master's and Ph.D. at the University of Washington in 1996 and 1998.[5][6]\nAfter postdoctoral research at the University of Minnesota, Environmental Protection Agency, and Duke University, she joined the Michigan faculty in 2000, and was promoted to full professor in 2008.[7]\n She was awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship in 2003,[8] becoming the second African-American woman after Kathleen Adebola Okikiolu to become a Sloan Fellow in mathematics. She won the James S. McDonnell 21st Century Scientist Award in 2005, and won the Blackwell-Tapia Prize in 2010.[9] In 2017, she was selected as a fellow of the Association for Women in Mathematics in the inaugural class.[10] Jackson's work also earned her recognition by Mathematically Gifted & Black as a Black History Month 2017 Honoree.[11] She was named a SIAM Fellow in the 2021 class of fellows, \"for innovative contributions to mathematical modeling in cancer biology and for the advancement of underrepresented minorities in science\".[12]\n ", "tags": ["21st-century American mathematicians", "Theoretical biologists", "Arizona State University alumni", "University of Washington alumni", "University of Michigan faculty", "American women mathematicians", "African-American mathematicians", "Living people", "1972 births", "Sloan Research Fellows", "Fellows of the Association for Women in Mathematics", "Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nTrachette JacksonBornJuly 24, 1972Monroe, LouisianaAlma\u00a0materArizona State University, University of WashingtonSpouse(s)Patrick NelsonChildrenTwo childrenScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of Michigan, University of Minnesota,Duke University\n\nTrachette Levon Jackson  (born July 24, 1972) is an American mathematician who is a professor of mathematics at the University of Michigan and is known for work in mathematical oncology.[1] She uses many different approaches, including continuous and discrete mathematical models, numerical simulations, and experiments to study tumor growth and treatment.
