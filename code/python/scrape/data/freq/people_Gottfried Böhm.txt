{"name": "Gottfried B\u00f6hm", "content": "Gottfried B\u00f6hm (born January 23, 1920) is a German architect and sculptor. His reputation is based on creating highly sculptural buildings made of concrete, steel, and glass. B\u00f6hm's first independent building was the Cologne chapel \"Madonna in the Rubble\" (now integrated into Peter Zumthor's design of the Kolumba museum renovation). B\u00f6hm's most influential and recognized building is the Maria, K\u00f6nigin des Friedens or Nevigeser Wallfahrtsdom.\n The most recently completed construction project involving Gottfried is the Hans Otto Theater in Potsdam (2006). In 1986, he became the first German architect to be awarded the prestigious Pritzker Prize.\n Gottfried B\u00f6hm was born into a family of architects in Offenbach, Hessen. His father, Dominikus B\u00f6hm, was renowned for his numerous avant-garde churches throughout Germany, many in Expressionist style. His grandfather was also an architect. After graduating from Technical University of Munich in 1946, he studied sculpture at a nearby fine-arts academy. Gottfried later integrated his clay model making skills acquired during this time at the academy into his design process.[1]\n After graduating in 1947, Gottfried worked for his father until the latter's death in 1955, and later took over his firm. During this period, he also worked with the \"Society for the Reconstruction of Cologne\" under Rudolf Schwarz. In 1951, he traveled to New York City and worked for six months in the architectural firm of Cajetan Baumann. While traveling in America he met two of his greatest inspirations, German architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius.\n In the following decades, B\u00f6hm constructed many buildings around Germany, including churches, museums, civic centers, office buildings, homes, and apartments. He has been considered to be both an expressionist and post-Bauhaus architect, but he prefers to define himself as an architect who creates \"connections\" between the past and the future, between the world of ideas and the physical world, between a building and its urban surroundings. In this vein, B\u00f6hm always envisions the color, form, and materials of a building in relationship with its setting. His earlier projects were done mostly in molded concrete, but more recently he has begun using more steel and glass in his buildings due to the technical advancements in both materials. His concern for urban planning is evident in many of his projects, harping back on his emphasis on \"connections\".\n B\u00f6hm was married to Elizabeth Haggenm\u00fcller, also an architect, until her death in 2012. He met Elizabeth in 1948, while studying in Munich. She assisted him in several of his projects, mainly through interior design.[2] They have four sons, three of whom are now architects.[1] He turned 100 in January 2020.[3]\n ", "tags": ["1920 births", "Living people", "People from Offenbach am Main", "20th-century German architects", "Brutalist architects", "Members of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts", "Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin", "Pritzker Architecture Prize winners", "Technical University of Munich alumni", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia", "RWTH Aachen University faculty", "German centenarians", "Articles with German-language sources (de)", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "BLP articles lacking sources from November 2018", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German architect and sculptor\nThis biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.
