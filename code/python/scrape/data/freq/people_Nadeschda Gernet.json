She was the daughter of State Councillor, Nikolai v. Gernet, and his wife Nadezhda.[1][5]\n In the spring of 1894, Gernet graduated from high school in Simbirsk with a gold medal.[5] That fall, she began her higher education at Women's University of Saint Petersburg, where she took science and math-related classes.[5] She was the first to graduate from the Women's University of Petersburg.[3] Gernet's academic interests included, but were not limited to, mathematics, astronomy, and physics.[5]\n In 1902, Gernet received a PhD for her thesis Untersuchung zur Variationsrechnung (On One New Method in the Variation of Calculus), written at the University of G\u00f6ttingen[5] in Germany. She was the second female doctoral candidate to study under the instruction of David Hilbert,[5][6][7] Anne Bosworth having been the first. In her thesis, Gernet extended the calculus of variations and generalized Hilbert's independence theorem to the case of two unknown functions.[5] After defending her thesis, Gernet became the second woman in Russia to hold a doctorate, and the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature: First Volume indexed Gernet's book within the same year.[8]\n As her German doctorate was not recognized in Russia, in 1915 Gernet submitted her thesis On the Fundamental Simplest Problems of Variation Calculus to Moscow University in order to obtain a Russian master's degree which would also enable her to take up a university position.[9][4] Gernet included a summary of the past achievements within the field of calculus of variations, and she was the first to attempt the inclusion of inequalities in the calculus of variations.[4]\n After defending her master's thesis and obtaining her degree with outstanding results from Moscow University, Gernet began her teaching career at the Saint Petersburg State University where she taught until 1929.[9] Her curriculum focused on educating female students in the Women's Higher Courses.[4][7] Soon after, she began teaching at the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute.[4][10] On January 1, 1943, Gernet died in St. Petersburg during the blockades of the Siege of Leningrad and was buried in the Smolensky Lutheran Cemetery.[4][7][11]\n Gernet's publications raised new discussions, and her work encouraged further development in the calculus of variations.[4]\n ", "tags": ["20th-century Russian mathematicians", "20th-century women mathematicians", "1877 births", "1943 deaths", "People from Ulyanovsk", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "Saint Petersburg State University faculty", "Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University faculty", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from August 2020", "CS1 Russian-language sources (ru)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Russian mathematician\nNadeschda GernetBorn(1877-04-18)April 18, 1877Simbirsk, Russian EmpireDiedJanuary 3, 1943(1943-01-03) (aged\u00a065)Cause\u00a0of deathSiege of LeningradResting placeSmolensky Lutheran CemeteryCitizenshipRussianEducationPh.D., University of G\u00f6ttingen\nMaster, University of MoscowOccupationMathematicianNadeschda Gernet, also Nadezhda, Russian: \u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0430 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442, (April 18, 1877 \u2013 January 1, 1943), was a Russian mathematician.[1][2] Gernet was the second woman in Russia to earn a doctorate.[3] She extended the calculus of variations to further functions on the basis developed by her instructor, David Hilbert, and was one of the first to include inequalities in the calculus of variations.[4][5]\nLife and career[edit]\nGernet was born in the Russian Empire city of Simbirsk, now Ulyanovsk.
