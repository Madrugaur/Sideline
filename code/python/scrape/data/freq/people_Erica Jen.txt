After her junior year at Yale University, Jen went to Beijing University for further education. She became the first American national to be allowed to study in China since 1949 and the first foreigner since the Cultural Revolution\n After returning to the U.S., Jen obtained a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from SUNY at Stony Brook and was the first postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory.[8]\n Jen served for the period 1983-86 as a University Scholar and assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Southern California. In 1986, Jen became a staff member in the Theoretical Division and Acting Deputy Director of the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n In 1995, Jen joined the Santa Fe Institute, a leading interdisciplinary research center for the study of complex adaptive systems.[9] She first served as Vice President for Academic Affairs and then as a Research Professor. Jen was the Principal Investigator for innovative programs in evolutionary dynamics, social networks, and distributed learning.[10] During her tenure at the Santa Fe Institute, Jen developed the groundbreaking SFI program on the robustness of physical, biological, ecological, and social systems. After 2003, Jen served as External Faculty, Science Board member, and now Science Board Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.
