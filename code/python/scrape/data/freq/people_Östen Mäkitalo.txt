He is considered to be the one of the most important developers in modern times together with Laila Ohlgren, both engineers at Telia. Together they developed the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) system and were the leading figures, representing Telia and Sweden, in the meetings with the other Nordic countries to find a common standard. Later they developed GSM and led the meetings to find a European and later world standard for mobile communication. They are many times considered the developer of the cellular phone and mobile telephony.[1][2][3][4]\n M\u00e4kitalo was born in Koutoj\u00e4rvi, Sweden, and obtained a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), while studying for a time he employed as a training assistant and lecturer at the Department of Physics at KTH. He started his professional career in 1961 at Televerket (now merged with TeliaSonera), the Swedish Telecommunications Administration, where he developed the first expansion compressor for high-quality sound.  In the early 1970s, he was accepted as a PhD student at KTH, with Tele Transmission theory as a major and a minor in mathematics. He was a visiting professor at KTH since 2005.[5] He was the elected member of Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences.\n M\u00e4kitalo assisted the development of first ever first generation cellular system and was also a key figure in the development of GSM.[6] M\u00e4kitalo was the part of the group that developed the world's first countrywide paging system with the possibility of sending messages. In addition, he has partaken  in the development of the technology for digital TV sound and digital terrestrial TV.[7] M\u00e4kitalo held about 20 patents, including one on a cellular system with roaming and handover from 1971[8] (the year after Bell labs applied for patent on a similar system).[9] He was an honorary doctor at Chalmers University of Technology.\n M\u00e4kitalo won numerous awards and honors, some of them were:\n ", "tags": ["1938 births", "2011 deaths", "Swedish electrical engineers", "Swedish inventors", "People from \u00d6vertorne\u00e5 Municipality", "KTH Royal Institute of Technology alumni", "KTH Royal Institute of Technology faculty", "Swedish civil servants", "Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences", "CS1 Swedish-language sources (sv)", "Articles with hCards", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "\u00d6sten M\u00e4kitaloBorn(1938-08-27)27 August 1938Koutoj\u00e4rvi, \u00d6vertorne\u00e5 Municipality, SwedenDied16 June 2011(2011-06-16) (aged\u00a072)NationalitySwedishEducationRoyal Institute of TechnologyOccupationEngineerEngineering careerProjectsTelecommunicationSignificant designGSMAwardsH.
