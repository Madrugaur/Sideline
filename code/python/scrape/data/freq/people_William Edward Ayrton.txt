He later studied under Lord Kelvin at Glasgow.\n In 1868, Ayrton went to Bengal in the service of the Indian Government Telegraph department, where he invented a method of detecting faults in lines, which was of great benefit in the maintenance of the overland communications network.\n Returning to England, Ayrton married Matilda.\u3000See #Family.\n In 1873, Ayrton accepted an invitation from the Japanese government as Chair of Natural Philosophy and Telegraphy at the new Imperial College of Engineering, Tokyo. He advised architect of the College for design of laboratory and demonstration rooms, and is credited with introducing the electric arc light to Japan in 1878.[1]\n On his return to London six years later, Ayrton became professor of applied physics at the Finsbury College of the City and Guilds of London Technical Institute, and, in 1884, he was chosen professor of electrical engineering, or of applied physics,[2] at the Central Technical College, South Kensington.  He published, both alone and jointly with others, a large number of papers on physical, and in particular electrical, subjects, and his name was especially associated, together with that of Professor John Perry, with the invention of a long series of electrical measuring instruments,[3] including the spiral-spring ammeter, and the wattmeter.  They also worked on railway electrification, produced a dynamometer and the first electric tricycle.  Ayrton is also known for his work on the electric searchlight.\n Ayrton died in London in 1908 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery.\n In 1872, Ayrton married his cousin, Matilda Chaplin (1846\u20131883), one of the Edinburgh Seven, the first group of matriculated undergraduate female students at any British university who fought for open medical education for women. Their marriage had taken place while Ayrton was on home leave from India and Matilda was involved in the Edinburgh Seven campaign. Chaplin was awarded a posthumous honorary MBChB in by the University of Edinburgh in 2019.[4]\n Chaplin and Ayrton's daughter was the feminist and author Edith Ayrton, wife of Israel Zangwill and mother of Oliver Zangwill.[2]\n Ayrton's second wife, Hertha Marks Ayrton, whom he married in 1885, assisted him in his research, and became known for her own scientific work on the electric arc and other subjects.[3] In 1899, Ayrton supported Hertha on her way to being elected the first woman member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers and the Royal Society awarded her a Hughes Medal in 1906. Their daughter Barbara Ayrton-Gould later became a Labour MP, and grandson Michael Ayrton, was an artist and sculptor.\n He was elected president in 1892 of the Institute of Electrical Engineers. \nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1881 and awarded their Royal Medal in 1901.\n ", "tags": ["1847 births", "1908 deaths", "Scientists from London", "Alumni of University College London", "English expatriates in Japan", "English physicists", "Foreign advisors to the government in Meiji-period Japan", "Foreign educators in Japan", "Burials at Brompton Cemetery", "English inventors", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "People educated at University College School", "Royal Medal winners", "Alumni of the University of Glasgow", "Presidents of the Physical Society", "English electrical engineers", "19th-century British physicists", "20th-century British physicists", "19th-century British engineers", "20th-century British engineers", "19th-century English scientists", "20th-century English scientists", "Ayrton family", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from June 2020", "Use British English from November 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "19th/20th-century British physicist\n\n\nWilliam Edward AyrtonWilliam Edward AyrtonBorn14 September 1847London, EnglandDied8 November 1908(1908-11-08) (aged\u00a061)London, EnglandCitizenshipBritishAwardsFellow of the Royal SocietyRoyal Medal (1901)Scientific careerFieldsphysics, electrical engineeringAcademic advisorsThe Lord Kelvin\n\nWilliam Edward Ayrton, FRS (14 September 1847\u00a0\u2013 8 November 1908) was an English physicist and electrical engineer.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n\n1.1 Early life and education\n1.2 India (1868\u20131872)\n1.3 Japan (1873\u20131879)\n1.4 London\n\n\n2 Family\n3 Honours and awards\n4 See also\n5 Notes\n6 References\n\n\nLife[edit]\nEarly life and education[edit]\nAyrton was born in London, the son of Edward Nugent Ayrton, a barrister, and educated at University College School and University College, London.
