{"name": "Jonathan Hornblower", "content": "\n Jonathan Hornblower (Chacewater, 5 July 1753 \u2013 Penryn, 23 February 1815)[1] was a British pioneer of steam power.\n The son of Jonathan Hornblower the Elder and the brother of Jabez Carter Hornblower, two fellow pioneers, the young Hornblower was educated at Truro Grammar School. He was baptised at Trelever on 25 July 1773, aged 20 (he and his family were much involved in Baptist churches in Cornwall), and was apprenticed to a metal-working tradesman at Penryn.[2] He married twice, first to his cousin Rosamund Phillips in 1775 and later to Elizabeth Jordan with whom he had two surviving daughters, Rosamund (1789) and Elizabeth (1790). He died on 23 February 1815 and is buried in St Gluvias Churchyard.\n He invented the compound steam engine in 1781 and patented it on 16 July in the same year. This type of engine has two cylinders instead of old single-cylinder engine, it contains a high-pressure and a low-pressure steam cylinder. The principle is that the steam first expands in the high-pressure cylinder and afterwards expands again in the low-pressure cylinder. Even though this was a revolutionary new steam technology, he was unfortunately prevented from pursuing his invention by litigation with James Watt (Boulton & Watt) over intellectual property.[3] His compound engine principle was not revived until 1804 (by Arthur Woolf[3]) following the expiration of Boulton and Watt's patent. Hornblower's compound engine principle contributed significantly to the increases in steam engine efficiency,[3] and it was the foundation of the expansion engine.\n After the patent litigation with Boulton & Watt, Hornblower came up with an idea for a new kind of rotary engine. He worked on it for several years and patented it on 5 June 1798. The engine's construction was the most complex so far, but as before he ran into trouble with Watt's patents on these subjects.\n He invented the double-beat steam valve around 1800.[4] This valve is a type of poppet valve, it can open against a high pressure with a minimum of force, usually operated by trip valve gear. The valve was used in railway locomotives, beam engines, grasshopper engines and paddle steamers and became widely used during the 19th century.\n In 1805 Hornblower developed a steam-wheel.[further explanation needed]\n Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2007): Jonathan Carter Hornblower.\n ", "tags": ["1753 births", "1815 deaths", "Engineers from Cornwall", "People from Chacewater", "British steam engine engineers", "People educated at Truro Cathedral School", "Burials in Cornwall", "Articles needing cleanup from August 2015", "All pages needing cleanup", "Cleanup tagged articles with a reason field from August 2015", "Wikipedia pages needing cleanup from August 2015", "Use dmy dates from April 2021", "Use British English from March 2012", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from May 2016", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For his father (1717-1780), see Jonathan Hornblower (born 1717).\nThis article may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.
