She also played viola in an all-women orchestra.[1][2][3]\n Born in Michigan to a farming supply store manager and a housewife, Carol and her siblings graduated from high school in Ohio. After that, she graduated from Manchester University, Indiana and went back to Michigan to study at Michigan State University (then called Michigan State College), where she earned a master's degree in 1950.[2][3]\n In 1951 she married Arthur Karp and took his last name. She continued her graduate study in mathematics while traveling to California and Japan with her husband, who worked in the US Navy.[2][3] She completed her Ph.D. in 1959 at the University of Southern California under the supervision of Leon Henkin. Her dissertation, in formal language theory and infinitary logic, was Languages with Expressions of Infinite Length;[4]\nshe later published it as a book with the same title (North\u2013Holland Publishing, 1964).[5]\n Even before completing her doctorate, Karp had taken a faculty position in 1958 at the University of Maryland, College Park, where she was promoted to full professor after only seven years and became a \"leader in the developing theory of infinitary logic\".[3] In 1969 she was diagnosed with breast cancer but remained active until her death three years later.[2][3]\n The Karp Prize of the Association for Symbolic Logic is named in her honor.
