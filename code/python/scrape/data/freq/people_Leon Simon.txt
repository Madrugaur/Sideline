{"name": "Leon Simon", "content": "\n Leon Melvyn Simon FAA (born 1945) is a Leroy P. Steele Prize[1] and B\u00f4cher Prize-winning[2] mathematician. He is currently Professor Emeritus in the Mathematics Department at Stanford University.\n Leon Simon, born 6 July 1945, received his BSc from the University of Adelaide in 1967, and his PhD in 1971 from the same institution, under the direction of James H. Michael. His doctoral thesis was titled Interior Gradient Bounds for Non-Uniformly Elliptic Equations. He was employed from 1968 to 1971 as a Tutor in Mathematics by the University.\n Simon has since held a variety of academic positions. He worked first at Flinders University as a lecturer, then at Australian National University as a professor, at the University of Melbourne, the University of Minnesota, at ETH Zurich, and at Stanford. He first came to Stanford in 1973 as Visiting Assistant Professor and was awarded a full professorship in 1986.\n In 1983 Simon was awarded the Australian Mathematical Society Medal. In the same year he was elected as a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science.\nIn 1994, he was awarded the B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize.[2][3][4] The B\u00f4cher Prize is awarded every five years to a groundbreaking author in analysis. In the same year he was also elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[3][4] In May 2003 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.[5] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[6] In 2017 he was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research.[1]\n He has authored several mathematics textbooks, including the Lectures on Geometric Measure Theory[7] and An Introduction to Multivariable Mathematics. He published the monograph Theorems on regularity and singularity of energy minimising maps in 1996, based in part on lectures he gave at Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in Z\u00fcrich.\n Simon has more than 100 'mathematical descendants', according to the Mathematics Genealogy Project.[8] Among his doctoral students there is Richard Schoen, a former winner of the B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize.\n ", "tags": ["1945 births", "Living people", "Australian mathematicians", "21st-century mathematicians", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Stanford University Department of Mathematics faculty", "Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Mathematical analysts", "EngvarB from September 2014", "Use dmy dates from September 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from February 2020", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For the British Zionist intellectual and civil servant, see Leon Simon (Zionist).\n\n\nLeon Melvyn SimonLeon Simon in 2005 (photo from MFO)Born (1945-07-06) 6 July 1945 (age\u00a075)Alma\u00a0materUniversity of AdelaideKnown\u00a0forRegularity problem for codimension\u20131 \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n\u2013dimensional minimal surfacesAwards\nLeroy P.
