{"name": "Ralph Rapson", "content": "Ralph Rapson (September 13, 1914 \u2013 March 29, 2008) was Dean of the School of Architecture at the University of Minnesota for 30 years.  He was one of the world's oldest practicing architects at his death at age 93, and also one of the most prolific. He was the father of philanthropist Rip Rapson.[1]\n Rapson was born in Alma, Michigan with a deformed right arm that was amputated at birth; he learned to draw expertly with his left hand.[1] He earned architecture degrees at the University of Michigan, and at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, where he studied under Eliel Saarinen. \u201cCranbrook was a very exciting, dynamic place where I met and worked with guys like Charlie Eames, Harry Bertoia, and Harry Weese,\u201d Rapson said.[2]\n As a young architect, Rapson worked for the Saarinen architectural office from 1940 to 1941. He moved to Chicago in 1941, where he worked with George Fred Keck and others.[3]\n Rapson taught architecture at the New Bauhaus School (now IIT Institute of Design) from 1942 to 1946, and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1946 to 1954.[1]\n He was Dean of the School of Architecture at the University of Minnesota from 1954 to 1984,[1] where \"generations of Minnesota architects came up through [his] tutelage\".[4]\n Rapson practiced in Minneapolis, Minnesota from 1954 to 2008. His work was predominantly in the Modernist style. \u201cPractically all the work I\u2019ve done is not too far off from Bauhaus principles,\u201d he said.[2]\n But his work was oriented to people rather than abstract principles. He said: \u201cWhenever I\u2019m designing a building or a piece of furniture, people become a strong part of my general approach. The design process isn\u2019t just about bricks and stones; for me it\u2019s also about the people in a building and how I expect them to live.\u201d[2]\n Rapson was a prolific sketch artist and kept volumes of sketchbooks from his various world travels. A book of selected sketches was published in 2002.[5] In the book's introduction, Cesar Pelli wrote: His drawings were \"completely self-assured\" and \"looked quintessentially American.\"\n Some of Rapson's most important projects include:\n Rapson died quietly in his home in Minneapolis on March 29, 2008. He was working in his office the previous day.\n Six hundred people attended his memorial service at the new Guthrie Theater. He was described as a \"rock star\" in the field.[10]\n Thomas Fisher, of the University of Minnesota's College of Design (the successor to the School of Architecture), said: \u201cHis passing ends an era in American architecture as well as in the history of the school, and he will be very much missed by the thousands of people he influenced.\u201d[11] Linda Mack remembered him as \"A gentleman of the old school [who] maintained his career, his dignity, his charm and his kindliness to the end. He left more than an architectural legacy.\"[12] According to Kay Lockhart, \"Ralph loved being an architect, and he told me once, he 'felt sorry for anyone who wasn't an architect.' He infused us all with that same spirit.\"[13]  His wife was Mary and he had two sons, Richard (Rip) and Thomas (Toby), and a daughter, Ren, from a previous marriage.\n ", "tags": ["1914 births", "2008 deaths", "20th-century American architects", "Brutalist architects", "Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning alumni", "Cranbrook Academy of Art alumni", "People from Alma, Michigan", "Architects from Minneapolis", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Ralph RapsonBorn(1914-09-13)September 13, 1914Alma, Michigan, United StatesDiedMarch 29, 2008(2008-03-29) (aged\u00a093)Minneapolis, Minnesota, United StatesNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of MichiganOccupationArchitectPracticeRalph Rapson and AssociatesBuildingsGuthrie Theater (demolished), Riverside Plaza (Cedar Square West), University of Minnesota Rarig Center, churches, residences and U.S. embassiesProjectsKnoll furniture, Case Study House\n\nRalph Rapson (September 13, 1914 \u2013 March 29, 2008) was Dean of the School of Architecture at the University of Minnesota for 30 years.

His wife is waving to him. Where is she? Hanging out diapers in the drying yard. Rapson\u2019s money was on the wrong machine.\"[6]\nThe \"Greenbelt House\" was constructed in 1989 for an exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.[7]\nIn recent years Rapson's firm developed a line of prefabricated modern houses called the Rapson Greenbelt, which grew out of a submission for the Dwell Home Design Invitational and are now available through a company called Wieler.\n1945: \"Rapson Rapid Rocker\" for Knoll Furniture\n1954: United States Embassy, Diplomatstaden, Stockholm, Sweden\n1954: United States Embassy, Copenhagen, Denmark\n1957: St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Edina, Minnesota\n1959: Prince of Peace Lutheran Church for the Deaf, St. Paul, Minnesota (demolished 2007)\n1962-73: Cedar Square West (now Riverside Plaza) housing complex, Minneapolis, Minnesota (a federally funded New-Town-in-Town)\n1963: Pillsbury House in Wayzata, Minnesota (demolished 1997)\n1963: Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis, Minnesota (demolished 2006)\n1964: State Capital Credit Union, Minneapolis, Minnesota (converted to Southeast Library in 1967)\n1969: St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church, St. Paul Park, Minnesota\n1972: Rarig Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota\nAwards and honors[edit]\nAmerican Institute of Architects College of Fellows (FAIA)\nGold Medal, Minnesota Society of Architects\nAssociation of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA) Distinguished Professor Award, 1984-85.[8]\nAIA/ACSA Topaz Medallion, 1987\nWinner, Dwell magazine lounge chair design competition, 2007\nNeutra Medal for Professional Excellence: In recognition for his contributions to the Environmental Design Profession and in honor of Modernist architect Richard Neutra, 1984.[9]\nDeath and remembrances[edit]\nRapson died quietly in his home in Minneapolis on March 29, 2008.
