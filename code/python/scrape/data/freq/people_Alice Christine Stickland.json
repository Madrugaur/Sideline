{"name": "Alice Christine Stickland", "content": "Alice Christine Stickland (16 March 1906 - 16 April 1987) was an applied mathematician and astrophysics engineer with interests in radar and radiowave propagation.[1]\n Alice Christine Stickland was born in Camberwell, London on 16 March 1906. Her father was a publisher's clerk.[1]\n Stickland studied mathematics at Kings College, London and graduated with a BSc in 1927.[2] She then went on to study privately while working at the Radio Research Station, Ditton Park. First receiving an MSc in mathematical physics in 1929 and then being awarded a PhD in mathematical physics from University of London in 1943. Her dissertation title was \u2018The Propagation of the Magnetic Field of the Electron Magnetic Wave along the Ground and in the Lower Atmosphere\u2019.[2]\n Stickland worked as a scientific civil servant at the Radio Research Station between 1928 - 1947. She worked with radar pioneer, Robert Watson-Watt, on long-wave propagation, Reginald Smith-Rose on short-wave propagation, and Edward Appleton on the properties of the ionosphere. \n Stickland, along with Smith-Rose, read a paper entitled 'Ultra-Short Wave Propagation - Comparison Between Theory and Experimental data' at the Institution of Electrical Engineers. The paper described the results of field intensity measurements obtained between 1937-39 using the Post Office radio-telephone link between Guernsey and Chaldon.[3]\n She officially retired in 1968 but continued to work as General Editor of the Annals of the International Years of the Quiet Sun (1964-65),[4] and with the International Council for Science\u2019s Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). She was heavily involved in the Girl Guides\u2019 Association.[1]\n ", "tags": ["1906 births", "1987 deaths", "British mathematicians", "Applied mathematicians", "British electrical engineers", "Alumni of King's College London", "Women engineers", "People from Camberwell", "Articles with hCards"], "raw": "Alice Christine SticklandBorn16 March 1906CamberwellDied16 April 1987OccupationEngineer\nAlice Christine Stickland (16 March 1906 - 16 April 1987) was an applied mathematician and astrophysics engineer with interests in radar and radiowave propagation.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Education\n3 Career\n4 Selected publications\n5 References\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nAlice Christine Stickland was born in Camberwell, London on 16 March 1906.
