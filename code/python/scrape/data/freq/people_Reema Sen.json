{"name": "Reema Sen", "content": "\n Reema Sen (born 29 October 1981[1]) is an Indian actress and model who primarily appeared in Bengali Theatre Films, Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi films.\n Reema Sen was born in Kolkata[2] on 29 October 1981. She completed high school from St. Thomas Girls School in Kidderpore, Kolkata, after which her family moved to Mumbai.\n Reema Sen married businessman Shiv Karan Singh in 2012. She gave birth to their son, Rudraveer, on 22 February 2013.[3]\n In 1998, she appeared in the video of the song \"Chandni Raatein\" sung by Shamsa Kanwal.[4]\n In Mumbai, she began her modelling career, appearing in a number of advertising campaigns. She then moved to films and made her acting debut with the blockbuster Telugu film Chitram, in which she acted opposite Uday Kiran, whom she later paired with in Manasantha Nuvve. She also appeared in the Tamil film Minnale alongside Madhavan, which was very successful.[5] Her first Hindi film Hum Ho Gaye Aapke flopped, and she decided to continue working in Tamil cinema. Her appearance in the Tamil film Rendu, again alongside Madhavan, was successful. Audience found her expressions in the film Thimiru cute.  Her negative role in Aayirathil Oruvan and Vallavan was highly praised by viewers and critics.[6][7]\n She ended her film career in 2012 after she got married. Her last Bollywood film was Gangs of Wasseypur alongside Manoj Bajpayee, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Richa Chadda.[8]\n In April 2006, a Madurai court issued non-bailable warrants against Sen and Shilpa Shetty for \"posing in an obscene manner\" in photographs published by the Tamil newspaper Dinakaran, owned by Sun Group.[9] The report stated that the two actresses had failed to comply with earlier summons for the same reason, hence the issuance of the warrants.[9] The petitioner submitted that the paper had published \"very sexy blow-ups and medium blow-ups\" in its December 2005 and January 2006 issues, and which allegedly violated the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act 1986, Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act 1956, and the Indian Penal Code Section 292 (Sale of Obscene Books). The petitioner further demanded that the images should be confiscated under the terms of the Press and Registration of Book Act 1867.\n In January 2007, outgoing Chief Justice Y. K. Sabharwal confirmed that Sen had written to him in order to enunciate guidelines against frivolous lawsuits against artists, but declined her plea on the grounds that she should have filed a formal petition instead of writing a letter.[10]\n ", "tags": ["1981 births", "Living people", "Indian film actresses", "Actresses in Tamil cinema", "Actresses in Bengali cinema", "Actresses from Kolkata", "Actresses in Hindi cinema", "Actresses in Telugu cinema", "Actresses in Kannada cinema", "21st-century Indian actresses", "Filmfare Awards South winners", "Female models from Kolkata", "Use dmy dates from May 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Not to be confused with Raima Sen, Rii Sen, Rimi Sen, Riya Sen, or Reema.\n\n\nReema SenSen during an EventBorn (1981-10-29) 29 October 1981 (age\u00a039)Kolkata, West Bengal, IndiaNationalityIndianOccupationActress, ModelYears\u00a0active1996-2012Spouse(s)Shiv Karan Singh \u200b(m.\u00a02012)\u200bChildrenRudraveer Singh (b. 2013)\nReema Sen (born 29 October 1981[1]) is an Indian actress and model who primarily appeared in Bengali Theatre Films, Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi films.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Personal life\n3 Career\n\n3.1 Music videos\n3.2 Film career\n3.3 Obscenity charges\n\n\n4 Filmography\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nReema Sen was born in Kolkata[2] on 29 October 1981.
