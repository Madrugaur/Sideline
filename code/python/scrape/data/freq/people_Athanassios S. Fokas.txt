Since 2002, he is Professor of Nonlinear Mathematical Science[3]  in the\nDepartment of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) at the University of Cambridge.\n Fokas earned a BS in Aeronautics from Imperial College in 1975 and a PhD in Applied mathematics from Caltech in 1979. His dissertation, Invariants, Lie-Backlund Operators and Backlund Transformations, was written under the direction of Paco Axel Lagerstrom.[2] He subsequently attended the University of Miami School of Medicine, earning an MD in 1986.\n After medical school, Fokas was appointed Professor and Chair of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Clarkson University in 1986. From there, he moved to Imperial College in 1996 to a Chair of Applied Mathematics. Since 2002, he holds the Professorship of Nonlinear Mathematical Science (2000) in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge, a professorship established in the year 2000 for a single tenure.[4] He was elected a Member of the Academy of Athens in 2004 and a professorial fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge in 2005.\n Fokas received the Naylor Prize from the London Mathematical Society in 2000.[5]  He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship (2009).\n Fokas is married to Regina Karousou-Fokas and they have two children, Anastasia and Ioanna. He also has a son, Alexander, from his first marriage to Allison Pearce.\n He has written about symmetries, integrable nonlinear PDEs, Painleve equations and random matrices, models for leukemia and protein folding, electro-magneto-enchephalography, nuclear imaging, and relativistic gravity. Also, he has introduced a new method for solving boundary value problems known as the Fokas method.\n I. M.
