{"name": "Alison Marr", "content": "Alison M. Marr (born 1980)[1] is an American mathematician and mathematics educator. Her research concerns graph theory and graph labeling, and she is also an advocate of inquiry-based learning in mathematics. She works as a professor of mathematics and computer science at Southwestern University in Texas.[2]\n Marr graduated from Murray State University in 2002, and earned a master's degree in mathematics at Texas A&M University in 2004.[3] She completed her Ph.D. in 2007 at Southern Illinois University; her dissertation, Labelings of Directed Graphs, was supervised by Walter D. Wallis.[3][4]\n She has been a member of the mathematics faculty at Southwestern University since 2007.[3] She was department chair for 2015\u20132018. Beyond mathematics, her teaching at Southwestern has included a freshman seminar on television game shows.[5]\n Marr is an advocate of inquiry-based learning in mathematics, a style of teaching through student research rather than through presentation of packaged solutions that is closely related to the Moore method. She was one of the founding officers of the inquiry-based learning special interest group of the Mathematical Association of America, which was established in 2016.[6] She is an editor of the Journal of Inquiry-Based Learning in Mathematics,[7] and serves on the board of directors of the Initiative for Mathematics Learning By Inquiry.[8]\n With Walter Wallis, Marr is the author of a book on magic graphs and graph labeling, Magic Graphs (2nd ed., Springer, 2013).[9] She spoke about magic graph labelings as an invited speaker at the Midwest Conference on Combinatorics, Cryptography, and Computing in 2011.[10]\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "1980 births", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "Graph theorists", "Mathematics educators", "Murray State University alumni", "Texas A&M University alumni", "Southern Illinois University alumni", "Southwestern University people", "21st-century women mathematicians", "CS1 maint: untitled periodical", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician and mathematics educator\nAlison M.
