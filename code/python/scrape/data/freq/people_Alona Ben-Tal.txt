Her research concerns dynamical systems and the mathematical modeling of human and bird breathing[1][2] and of electrical power systems.\n Ben-Tal originally studied mechanical engineering[2][3] at the Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology, earning a bachelor's degree there in 1991 and a master's degree in 1994.[2][4] After working in industry for three years, she moved with her family to New Zealand and returned to graduate study in mathematics,[2][3] completing a Ph.D. in 2001 at the University of Auckland with the dissertation A Study of Symmetric Forced Oscillators supervised by Vivien Kirk.[5]\n After she completed her doctorate, she held positions at the University of Auckland as a fixed-term lecturer in mathematics, and then as a NZ Science & Technology Post-doctoral Fellow in the Bioengineering Institute, before moving to Massey University as a lecturer in 2005.[2]\n In her work on human breathing, Ben-Tal has studied respiratory sinus arrhythmia, the phenomenon that the heart rate speeds up while inhaling and slows down while exhaling. Initially hypothesising that this variability would improve the rate of gas exchange in the lungs, her research found that instead it saves effort by the heart while maintaining even levels of blood oxygenation.[1][2]\n In birds, Ben-Tal has studied the one-way nature of certain air passages in bird lungs, and the ability of birds to change the speed of airflow through these passages. Her research found that, in some circumstances, birds spend less time inhaling than they do exhaling.[1][2]\n Ben-Tal was named a fellow of the New Zealand Mathematical Society in 2016.[4][6]\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "Israeli mathematicians", "Israeli women mathematicians", "New Zealand mathematicians", "New Zealand women scientists", "Applied mathematicians", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology alumni", "University of Auckland faculty", "Massey University faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from October 2020", "Use list-defined references from October 2020", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Year of birth missing (living people)"], "raw": "Israeli and New Zealand applied mathematician\n\nAlona Ben-Tal is an Israeli and New Zealand applied mathematician who works as an associate professor and deputy head of school in the School of Natural and Computational Sciences at Massey University.
