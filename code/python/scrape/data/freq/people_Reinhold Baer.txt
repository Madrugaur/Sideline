[Linear Algebra and Projective Geometry (1952)] is an account of the representation of vector spaces over division rings, of projectivities by semi-linear transformations and of dualities by semi-bilinear forms.[3]\nHe died of heart failure on October 22nd in 1979.\nIn 2016 the Reinhold Baer Prize for the best Ph.D. thesis in Group Theory was set up in his honour.[4]\n\nBibliography[edit]\n\n\n\nScholia has a profile for Reinhold Baer (Q78085).\n\n1934: \"Erweiterung von Gruppen und ihren Isomorphismen\", Mathematische Zeitschrift 38(1): 375\u2013416 (German) doi:10.1007/BF01170643 MR1545456\n1940: \"Nilpotent groups and their generalizations\", Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 47: 393\u2013434 MR0002121\n1944: \"The higher commutator subgroups of a group\", Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 50: 143\u2013160 MR0009954\n1945: \"Representations of groups as quotient groups.
