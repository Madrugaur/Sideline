{"name": "Ernest Cormier", "content": "Ernest Cormier, OC (December 5, 1885 \u2013 January 1, 1980) was a Canadian engineer and architect. He spent much of his career in the Montreal area, designing notable examples of Art Deco architecture, including Cormier House (his home in Montreal's Golden Square Mile) and the Supreme Court of Canada Building in Ottawa.\n Cormier was born in Montreal, the son of a medical doctor, and he studied civil engineering at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Montreal. After graduation in 1906, he worked in the research department of the Dominion Bridge Company in Montreal.\n In 1909, he studied at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, in the atelier of Jean-Louis Pascal. In 1914, he was the recipient of the Henry Jarvis Scholarship, awarded by the Royal Institute of British Architects. Through its British Prix de Rome, Cormier spent two years in Rome, where he studied the ancient works. Following his return to Paris in January 1917, he was employed by the engineering firm of Consid\u00e8re, Pelnard et Caquot, specialists in concrete, and he graduated as an architect of the French Government (DPLG).\n He was a professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Montreal from 1921 to 1954. After his death in 1980, he was interred in Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.[1]\n Cormier's major work is the central building of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (now known as the Roger Gaudry Building) on the north slope of Mount Royal. This huge example of the Art Deco style was built between World War I and the middle of World War II, and it has been kept in a nearly pristine shape over the decades. It is a composition of simple forms of planes and surfaces in successive relief, emphasizing vertical lines. The light buff vitrified brick has trimmings of Missisquoi marble.[2]  The only major destruction of his designs took place within the interior spaces. These changes occurred in the 1970s, when the great multi-storey hall of the central library was filled up with several smaller, single-storey rooms for the faculty of medicine and its library.\n Another important example of Cormier's work can be found on another Quebec university campus, the Casault pavilion of Universit\u00e9 Laval, familiarly known by students as the 'Louis-Jacques'. Designed in 1948 but only completed in 1960, it is a massive cathedral-like building, originally designed as Quebec City's Grand S\u00e9minaire, which is particularly spectacular viewed from a distance along the impressive mall that runs along the east\u2013west axis of the campus grounds.[3] Despite an unfortunate renovation scheme in the 1970s, which gutted the chapel, filled in the magnificent enclosed courtyard and transformed the interior into an undecipherable labyrinth, the building has become the most recognized landmark of the second-oldest university in North America and home to Laval's faculties of Music and Communications, as well as to Quebec's National Archives.\n Cormier also designed two important Roman Catholic Churches for the Diocese of Providence, Rhode Island, USA.[4] One of them, St. John the Baptist Church of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n Cormier's own home, on Montreal's Pine Avenue, is one of the finest examples of an Art Deco dwelling in the world.[citation needed] Former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau purchased the building in 1979, and he lived there following his retirement until his death in 2000.[5]\n Cormier is also responsible for the classic ch\u00e2teau-style Supreme Court of Canada Building (1939\u201340) in Ottawa.[6]\n He was a design consultant for the United Nations building in New York City. In Toronto, Cormier designed St. Michael's College School (1950) and Carr Hall at St. Michael's College (University of Toronto, 1954).[7]\n In addition to showing great balance between the disciplines of engineering and architecture in most of his buildings, Cormier also had great skills as a painter and illustrator. He left many renderings of his works, done in the planning stages.\n In 1974, Cormier was inducted into the Order of Canada by Governor General Jules L\u00e9ger, and he received numerous honours and awards. The \u00c9difice Ernest-Cormier (which he co-designed), the Quebec Court of Appeal building in Old Montreal, is named in his honour.[8]\n In 2018, Cormier was named a National Historic Person, and the Ernest Cormier House and the Roger Gaudry Building (at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al) were designated National Historic Sites.[9]\n ", "tags": ["1885 births", "1980 deaths", "20th-century Canadian architects", "Architects of Roman Catholic churches", "Art Deco architects", "Architects from Montreal", "Canadian ecclesiastical architects", "Officers of the Order of Canada", "Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada)", "Burials at Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2011", "CS1 errors: external links", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Ernest CormierCormier in the 1920sBornDecember 5, 1885Montreal, QuebecDiedJanuary 1, 1980(1980-01-01) (aged\u00a094)NationalityCanadianAlma\u00a0mater\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-ArtsOccupationArchitectBuildingsCentral building of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al; Casault pavilion of Universit\u00e9 Laval; Supreme Court of Canada Building\n\n Central building of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (Roger Gaudry Building)\n Cormier House in Montreal\n Supreme Court of Canada Building in Ottawa\n \u00c9glise Sainte-Marguerite-Marie-Alacoque, Montreal (1924\u20131925)\n \u00c9glise Saint-Ambroise, Montreal (1923)\nErnest Cormier, OC (December 5, 1885 \u2013 January 1, 1980) was a Canadian engineer and architect.
