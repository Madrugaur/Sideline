{"name": "Maria Hoffmann-Ostenhof", "content": "Maria Hoffmann-Ostenhof (n\u00e9e Bauer, born 1947) is an Austrian mathematician known for her work on the behavior of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and particularly on its asymptotic analysis, nodal lines, and behavior near its singularities.[1]\n Hoffmann-Ostenhof was born on 12 January 1947 in Vienna. She studied mathematics at the University of Vienna, with a year visiting the University of Zurich,[1] and completed her Ph.D. in 1973 at the University of Vienna.
