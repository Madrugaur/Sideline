He studied law in Erlangen since 1821. He then studied astronomy in G\u00f6ttingen and K\u00f6nigsberg. He continued his studies in astronomy and physics while living in his father's manor in Perlachseck near Munich. From 1832 to 1849, Steinheil was professor for mathematics and physics at the University of Munich.\n In 1839, Steinheil used silver chloride and a cardboard camera to make pictures in negative from the Museum of Art and the Munich Frauenkirche, then taking another picture of the negative to get a positive, the actual black and white reproduction of a view on the object. The pictures produced were round with a diameter of 4\u00a0cm, the method was later named the \u201cSteinheil method.\u201d[1] It was the first daguerreotype in Germany.[2][3]\n In 1846, Steinheil travelled to Naples to install a new system for weight and measure units. Three years later, he was appointed to the Board of Telegraphy of the Austrian Trade Ministry. Steinheil was tasked with designing a telegraph network for the entire empire, and helped to form the Deutsch-\u00d6sterreichischer Telegraphenverein (German-Austrian Telegraph Society). \nIn 1851, he started the Swiss telegraph network. Steinheil returned Munich as konservator (curator) of the mathematical-physical collections and ministerial secretary in the Trade Ministry of Bavaria.[clarification needed]\n In 1854, he founded C. A. Steinheil & S\u00f6hne, an optical-astronomical company.[2][3] The company built telescopes, spectroscopes and photometers \u2013 one of Steinheil's inventions, used to measure brightness. C.A. Steinheil & S\u00f6hne produced large telescopes for observatories in Uppsala, Mannheim, Leipzig, Utrecht.[2][3] The company also produced refractors and reflectors with silver-covered mirrors. The process for creating the silvering was developed by Steinheil's friend Justus Liebig. In 1862, Steinheil's sons started managing the company.\n Steinheil died in Munich in Bavaria on 14 September 1870. He was buried in the Alter S\u00fcdfriedhof cemetery.\n Some sources state that Steinheilite, a transparent mineral that resembles blue quartz but is actually a form of iolite, was named after Carl von Steinheil.[3] However, the name was in use as early as 1811, too early to be named after Carl von Steinheil, and sources from that time instead attribute it to Fabian Steinheil, the Russian military governor of Finland.[4]\n ", "tags": ["1801 births", "1870 deaths", "Engineers from Munich", "19th-century German engineers", "19th-century physicists", "19th-century German scientists", "19th-century astronomers", "19th-century German mathematicians", "German physicists", "German inventors", "German astronomers", "Mathematics educators", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich faculty", "Alsatian-German people", "Alsatian nobility", "People from Ribeauvill\u00e9", "Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art", "Burials at the Alter S\u00fcdfriedhof", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the New International Encyclopedia", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the Encyclopedia Americana with a Wikisource reference", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Coordinates not on Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from December 2012", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German physicist\nCarl August von SteinheilBorn(1801-10-12)12 October 1801Ribeauvill\u00e9, AlsaceDied14 September 1870(1870-09-14) (aged\u00a068)Munich, BavariaResting placeAlter S\u00fcdfriedhof, Munich48\u00b007\u203238\u2033N 11\u00b033\u203254\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff48.127222\u00b0N 11.565\u00b0E\ufeff / 48.127222; 11.565Coordinates: 48\u00b007\u203238\u2033N 11\u00b033\u203254\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff48.127222\u00b0N 11.565\u00b0E\ufeff / 48.127222; 11.565CitizenshipGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ErlangenScientific careerFieldsAstronomy, Physics, Engineering, MathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of MunichAustrian Trade MinistryC.
