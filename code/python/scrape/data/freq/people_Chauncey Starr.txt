In 1967 he became the Dean of the UCLA School of Engineering and Applied Science.[2]  Six years later he founded the Electric Power Research Institute  and was its first president. He is the only President Emeritus of the EPRI.\n Starr was a member of the Board of Directors at the George C. Marshall Institute, a member of the Board of Science Advisors of the Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) and, like most other members of that board, he signed the Leipzig Declaration on Global Climate Change.\n Starr died at his home in Atherton, California from natural causes. The day before his death he celebrated his 95th birthday at an EPRI ceremony.[3]\n Starr was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1965. He received in 1979 the Walter H. Zinn Award from the American Nuclear Society,[4] and in 1990 he was awarded the National Medal of Technology by then President George H. W. Bush.[5] He was a recipient of the Harold Pender Award in 1975.\n ", "tags": ["American nuclear engineers", "American electrical engineers", "Engineers from California", "Manhattan Project people", "1912 births", "2007 deaths", "Atomics International", "National Medal of Technology recipients", "People from Los Angeles", "UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science faculty", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute alumni", "20th-century engineers", "People from Atherton, California", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from June 2019", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Chauncey StarrBornApril 14, 1912Newark, New JerseyDiedApril 17, 2007(2007-04-17) (aged\u00a095)Atherton, CaliforniaAcademic backgroundAlma materRensselaer Polytechnic Institute\n\nChauncey Starr (April 14, 1912 \u2013 April 17, 2007) was an American electrical engineer and an expert in nuclear energy.[1]\nBorn in Newark, New Jersey, Starr received an electrical engineering degree in 1932 and a Ph.D. in physics in 1935 from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\nStarr was Vice President of Rockwell International and President of its Atomics International Division.
