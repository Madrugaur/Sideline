{"name": "Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick", "content": "Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick (February 22, 1852, Marburg \u2013 February 11, 1937, Herrsching am Ammersee) was a German ophthalmologist who invented the contact lens. He was the nephew of the German physiologist Adolf Eugen Fick, and the son of the German anatomy professor Franz Ludwig Fick.\n When Fick was three years old, his mother died, and when he was six, his father, anatomy professor Ludwig Fick, died. Soon afterwards, he was raised in Adolf Fick's family. Adolf Fick was his uncle, godfather, and a famous physiologist, and influenced his nephew's studies in ophthalmology.\n The younger Fick studied medicine in W\u00fcrzburg, Z\u00fcrich, Marburg, and Freiburg. In 1884, Fick traveled to Germany to marry Marie, the daughter of Johannes Wislicenus; he later had eight children with her.[1]\n In 1888, he constructed and fitted what was to be considered the first successful model of a contact lens: an afocal scleral contact shell made from heavy brown glass, which he tested first on rabbits, then on himself, and lastly on a small group of volunteers. It was considered the first successful model of a contact lens. His idea was advanced independently by several innovators in the years that followed.\n During World War I, Fick headed field hospitals in France, Russia and Turkey. At the same time he continued working on ophthalmologic anatomy and optics.\n ", "tags": ["1852 births", "1937 deaths", "German ophthalmologists", "German inventors", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For the physiologist, see Adolf Eugen Fick.\nAdolf Gaston Eugen FickBorn(1852-02-22)February 22, 1852DiedFebruary 11, 1937(1937-02-11) (aged\u00a084)Known\u00a0forInventor of contact lens\nAdolf Gaston Eugen Fick (February 22, 1852, Marburg \u2013 February 11, 1937, Herrsching am Ammersee) was a German ophthalmologist who invented the contact lens.
