{"name": "Ward Christensen", "content": "Ward Christensen (born 1945 in West Bend, Wisconsin, United States) is the co-founder of the CBBS bulletin board, the first bulletin board system (BBS) ever brought online. Christensen, along with partner Randy Suess.,[1] started development during a blizzard in Chicago, Illinois, and officially established CBBS four weeks later, on February 16, 1978.[2][3][4]\n Christensen was noted for building software tools for his needs. He wrote a cassette-based operating system before floppies and hard disks were common. When he lost track of the source code for some programs he wrote ReSource, an iterative disassembler for the Intel 8080, to help him regenerate the source code.
