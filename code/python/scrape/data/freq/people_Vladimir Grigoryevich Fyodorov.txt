He designed a number of automatic rifles: one chambered in 7.62\u00a0mm (1912), another in 6.5\u00a0mm for a cartridge of his own design (1913), and one of the first prototype assault rifles in the world: the Avtomat Fyodorova (1916), which was originally designed to fire a shortened Arisaka 6.5mm rifle cartridge, but saw service firing the full-sized 6.5\u00a0mm Arisaka rifle cartridge due to reliability issues in testing and foresight of logistical problems. Automatic weapons designed by Fyodorov were used during World War I and the Russian Civil War.\n After the October Revolution, Fyodorov was appointed head and technical director (1918\u20131931) of the first Soviet weapons plant, which produced submachine guns of his design. In 1921, he organized and headed a design bureau at the automatic small arms factory. In 1922, Fyodorov designed the Fyodorov-Shpagin machine gun. In 1931\u20131933, Fyodorov worked as a standardization consultant at a weapons and machinegun trust. He then published a number of works on automatic weapons and was appointed a small arms consultant at Narkomat and with the Ministry of Arms (1942\u20131946). Between 1946 and 1953, Fyodorov was a member of the Academy of Artillery Sciences. He was a tutor of Vasily Degtyaryov, Georgi Shpagin, Sergei Simonov and others. Vladimir Fyodorov authored a number of scientific works on the history, design, production, and combat use of small firearms.\n This article about a Russian engineer, inventor or industrial designer is a stub.
