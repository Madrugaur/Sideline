{"name": "Georg von Tiesenhausen", "content": "Georg Heinrich Patrick Baron von Tiesenhausen (May 18, 1914\u00a0\u2013 June 4, 2018)[5] was a United States-based German rocket scientist. \n After being brought to the United States in 1953 as part of Operation Paperclip, he was part of Wernher von Braun's team at the United States Army, and later, NASA. He is credited with the first complete design of the Lunar Roving Vehicle and made a variety of other contributions to the space program. He was a member of Baltic German noble family of Tiesenhausen.\n Tiesenhausen was born in Riga, Latvia, in the Russian Empire[6] to a Baltic German family from his father's side, while his mother was of Scottish ancestry. He studied engineering in Hamburg, but was conscripted to the Luftwaffe in 1939 and sent to the Eastern Front. He was allowed to continue his studies and in 1943 and graduated from University of Hamburg. After his graduation he was sent to the Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center.[7][8]\n Tiesenhausen worked with Wernher von Braun developing V-2 rockets in Germany during World War II. He came to America in 1953 as part of Operation Paperclip, where he again worked with von Braun on guided missiles such as the Redstone, this time for the United States Army at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. He was later transferred to NASA, where he worked on various spaceflight programs, including the Apollo program, which landed men on the Moon.[9]\n He continued to work for NASA well into the Shuttle era.[10][11] Later he worked on space tether missions.[9]\n Between 1987 and 2010, von Tiesenhausen frequently volunteered at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, lecturing to students in Space Camp programs about the future of space exploration and other topics.[12][13]\n In 2007, he became one of the original inductees into the Space Camp Hall of Fame.[14] On February 3, 2011, he was presented with the U.S. Space & Rocket Center's Lifetime Achievement Award for Education by Neil Armstrong.[15] \"Dr. von T is one of those rare individuals who has a natural ability to inform and inspire, to educate and motivate, and, most remarkably, to endure,\" Armstrong said.[16]\n ", "tags": ["1914 births", "2018 deaths", "Scientists from Riga", "Early spaceflight scientists", "German aerospace engineers", "German centenarians", "German emigrants to the United States", "German inventors", "German people of World War II", "German people of Scottish descent", "German rocket scientists", "German untitled nobility", "Operation Paperclip", "V-weapons people", "Baltic-German people", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Georg Heinrich Patrick Baron von Tiesenhausen [1]Born(1914-05-18)May 18, 1914Riga, Latvia, Russian EmpireDiedJune 4, 2018(2018-06-04) (aged\u00a0104)Huntsville, Alabama, U.S.Alma\u00a0materHAW HamburgKnown\u00a0forOperation Paperclip,  Lunar Roving VehicleSpouse(s)Asta Esch Von Tiesenhausen [2] [3]ChildrenEvamaria,[2] Georg Jr.[2] [4] and Jutta[2]Scientific careerFieldsMathematics, EngineeringInstitutionsWehrmacht, Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center,United States Army, NASA\n\nGeorg Heinrich Patrick Baron von Tiesenhausen (May 18, 1914\u00a0\u2013 June 4, 2018)[5] was a United States-based German rocket scientist. \nAfter being brought to the United States in 1953 as part of Operation Paperclip, he was part of Wernher von Braun's team at the United States Army, and later, NASA.
