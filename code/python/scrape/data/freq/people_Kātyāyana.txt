Though the object a word is referring to is non-eternal, the substance of its meaning, like a lump of gold used to make different ornaments, remains undistorted, and is therefore permanent.\n Realizing that each word represented a categorization, he came up with the following conundrum (following Bimal Krishna Matilal):\n Clearly, this leads to infinite regress. K\u0101ty\u0101yana's solution to this was to restrict the universal category to that of the word itself \u2014 the basis for the use of any word is to be the very same word-universal itself.\" \n This view may have been the nucleus of the Spho\u1e6da doctrine enunciated by Bhart\u1e5bhari in the 5th century, in which he elaborates\nthe word-universal as the superposition of two structures \u2014 the meaning-universal or the semantic structure (artha-j\u0101ti) \nis superposed on the sound-universal or the phonological structure (\u015babda-j\u0101ti).\n In the tradition of scholars like Pingala, K\u0101ty\u0101yana was also interested in mathematics.

[3]\n\nWorks[edit]\nHe is known for two works:\n\nThe V\u0101rttikak\u0101ra, an elaboration on P\u0101\u1e47ini grammar. Along with the Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya of Pata\u00f1jali, this text  became a core part of the Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a (grammar) canon.  This was one of the six Vedangas, and constituted compulsory education for students in the following twelve centuries.\nHe also composed one of the later \u015aulbas\u016btras, a series of nine texts on the geometry of altar constructions, dealing with rectangles, right-sided triangles, rhombuses, etc.[4]\nViews[edit]\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana's views on the sentence-meaning connection tended towards naturalism. K\u0101ty\u0101yana believed, that the word-meaning relationship was not a result of human convention. For K\u0101ty\u0101yana, word-meaning relations were siddha, given to us, eternal.

K\u0101ty\u0101yana's solution to this was to restrict the universal category to that of the word itself \u2014 the basis for the use of any word is to be the very same word-universal itself.\" \nThis view may have been the nucleus of the Spho\u1e6da doctrine enunciated by Bhart\u1e5bhari in the 5th century, in which he elaborates\nthe word-universal as the superposition of two structures \u2014 the meaning-universal or the semantic structure (artha-j\u0101ti) \nis superposed on the sound-universal or the phonological structure (\u015babda-j\u0101ti).\nIn the tradition of scholars like Pingala, K\u0101ty\u0101yana was also interested in mathematics.
