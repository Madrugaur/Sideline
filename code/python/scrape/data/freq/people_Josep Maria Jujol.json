{"name": "Josep Maria Jujol", "content": "Josep Maria Jujol i Gibert (Catalan pronunciation:\u00a0[\u0292u\u02c8z\u025bb m\u0259\u02c8\u027ei.\u0259 \u0292u\u02c8\u0292\u0254l]; 16 September 1879 \u2013 1 May 1949) was a Catalan architect. Jujol's wide field of activity ranged from furniture designs and painting, to architecture. He worked with Antoni Gaud\u00ed on many of his most famous works. Among Jujol's projects are Casa Batll\u00f3, Casa Mil\u00e0, Park G\u00fcell, and Our Lady of Montserrat, and among his design styles are Modernisme and Art Nouveau.\n Josep Maria Jujol was born in Tarragona where he lived until age 9. He was the son of Andreu Jujol, a school director, and of Teresa Gibert i Vives. He was born on the top floor of the public school, Sant Joan, where his father worked. He began to draw at an early age, and always had an admiration for nature. According to his biography, he would roam the hills of Tarragona and its Roman ruins. They lived at the school for nine years before his father was transferred in 1888 to Carrer Zurbano in Gr\u00e0cia, which is now integrated into the City of Barcelona.\n Jujol's father was transferred once again in 1893 to the City of Barcelona. There Jujol began to walk the medieval district, developed an admiration for gothic architecture and began to draft the buildings. The family moved to the Gran Via in the Eixample District of Barcelona, where he experienced modern and modernist buildings. \nIn 1901, he was accepted in the Architectural program in Barcelona. While attending school, he first worked with Antoni Maria Gallissa i Soqu\u00e9 (Don Antoni), whom he admired as a person and an architect. His first project was a commission for Don Antoni to decorate the street called Carrer Fenen for the Merc\u00e8 Festival (Festes de la Merc\u00e8). Jujol had to create the metal frames and stained glass windows. He continued to work for Don Antoni until 1903. He then began to work in the studio of Josep Font i Gum\u00e0. Where he collaborated with him on the Trinity altar in the Basilica de Santa Maria del Mar. In his spare time he completed plans for an amusement park that was to emulate the solar system. The plan was never revived.\n In 1906 he received his certificate as an architect and was able to work on his own. One of his first projects was to decorate Don Antoni's entrance stairway with his trademark sgraffito.\n Jujol became acquainted with Antoni Gaud\u00ed through their mutual friend, Dr. Santal\u00f3. Gaud\u00ed soon worked in partnership with Jujol. Their first project together was Casa Batll\u00f3. It is speculated in Jujol's biography that he had a great influence on Gaud\u00ed's use of colour and shapes. However, this is not for certain. In any case, Gaud\u00ed had great respect for Jujol's views and entrusted him as a collaborator on his projects for many years.\n Jujol died at Barcelona in 1949.\n Torre de la Creu, a private house in Sant Joan Desp\u00ed, near Barcelona.\n Can Negre, Sant Joan Desp\u00ed, near Barcelona.\n Tower on Casa Bofarull in Els Pallaresos, near Tarragona\n Parc G\u00fcell detail (Barcelona)\n Parc G\u00fcell detail (Barcelona)\n Vistabella Church, in La Secuita, near Tarragona.\n Casa Mil\u00e0 detail (Barcelona)\n He added the \"graffiti\" patterns\n Stairs of the Iglesias house, 284 Mallorca street (Barcelona), by Josep Maria Jujol in 1913.\n Ma\u00f1ach Workshop, in Barcelona, currently converted into a school.
