{"name": "Montgolfier brothers", "content": "\n Joseph-Michel Montgolfier (26 August 1740 \u2013 26 June 1810) and Jacques-\u00c9tienne Montgolfier  (6 January 1745 \u2013 2 August 1799) were paper manufacturers from Annonay, in Ard\u00e8che, France best known as inventors of the Montgolfi\u00e8re-style hot air balloon, globe a\u00e9rostatique. They launched the first piloted ascent, carrying Jacques-\u00c9tienne. Joseph-Michel also invented the self-acting hydraulic ram (1796), Jacques-\u00c9tienne founded the first paper-making vocational school and the brothers invented a process to manufacture transparent paper.\n The Montgolfier brothers Joseph-Michel (born 26 August 1740)[1] and Jacques-\u00c9tienne (born 6 January 1745)[1] were born into a family of paper manufacturers founded in 1534 in Annonay, in Ard\u00e8che, France.[2] Their parents were Pierre Montgolfier (1700\u20131793) and his wife, Anne Duret (1701\u20131760), who had 16 children.[1]  Pierre Montgolfier established his eldest son, Raymond (1730\u20131772), as his successor.[citation needed]\n Joseph-Michel was the 12th child and was described as a maverick and dreamer (\"a typical inventor's temperament\") and was impractical in terms of business and personal affairs. \u00c9tienne was the 15th child, had a much more even and businesslike temperament and was sent to Paris to train as an architect. After the sudden and unexpected death of Raymond in 1772, he was recalled to Annonay to run the family business. In the subsequent 10 years, \u00c9tienne applied his talent for technical innovation to the family business of paper making, which then as now was a high-tech industry. He succeeded in incorporating the latest Dutch innovations of the day into the family mills.[citation needed]\n Of the two brothers, it was Joseph who was first interested in aeronautics; as early as 1775 he built parachutes, and once jumped from the family house. He first contemplated building machines when he observed laundry drying over a fire incidentally form pockets that billowed upwards.[3]  Joseph made his first definitive experiments in November 1782 while living in Avignon. He reported some years later that he was watching a fire one evening while contemplating one of the great military issues of the day\u2014an assault on the fortress of Gibraltar, which had proved impregnable from both sea and land.[4] Joseph mused on the possibility of an air assault using troops lifted by the same force that was lifting the embers from the fire. He believed that the smoke itself was the buoyant part and contained within it a special gas, which he called \"Montgolfier Gas\", with a special property he called levity, which is why he preferred smoldering fuel.\n Joseph then built a box-like chamber 1\u00d71\u00d71.3\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft by 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) by 4\u00a0ft) out of very thin wood, and covered the sides and top with lightweight taffeta cloth. He crumpled and lit some paper under the bottom of the box. The contraption quickly lifted off its stand and collided with the ceiling.\n Joseph recruited his brother to balloon building by writing, \"Get in a supply of taffeta and of cordage, quickly, and you will see one of the most astonishing sights in the world.\" The two brothers built a similar device, scaled up by three (so 27 times greater in volume). On 14 December 1782 they did their very first test flight, lighting with wool and hay, and the lifting force was so great, that they lost control of their craft. The device floated nearly two kilometers (about 1.2\u00a0mi) and was destroyed after landing by the \"indiscretion\" of passersby.[5]\n To make a public demonstration and to claim its invention the brothers constructed a globe-shaped balloon of sackcloth tightened with three thin layers of paper inside. The envelope could contain nearly 790\u00a0m\u00b3 (28,000 cubic feet) of air and weighed 225\u00a0kg (500\u00a0lb). It was constructed of four pieces (the dome and three lateral bands) and held together by 1,800 buttons. A reinforcing fish net of cord covered the outside of the envelope.\n On 4 June 1783, they flew the balloon at Annonay in front of a group of dignitaries from the \u00c9tats \u2033particuliers\u2033\u2033. The flight covered 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi), lasted 10 minutes, and had an estimated altitude of 1,600-2,000\u00a0m (5,200-6,600\u00a0ft). Word of their success quickly reached Paris. \u00c9tienne went to the capital to make further demonstrations and to solidify the brothers' claim to the invention of flight. Joseph, given his unkempt appearance and shyness, remained with the family. \u00c9tienne was the epitome of sober virtues ... modest in clothes and manner...[6]\n In collaboration with the wallpaper manufacturer Jean-Baptiste R\u00e9veillon, \u00c9tienne constructed a 37,500-cubic-foot (1,060\u00a0m3) envelope of taffeta coated with a varnish of alum for fireproofing.  The balloon was sky blue and decorated with golden flourishes, signs of the zodiac, and suns. The design showed the intervention of R\u00e9veillon. The next test was on 11 September from the grounds of la Folie Titon, close to R\u00e9veillon's house.  There was some concern about the effects of flight into the upper atmosphere on living creatures. The king proposed to launch two convicted criminals, but it is most likely that the inventors decided to send a sheep, a duck, and a rooster aloft first.\n On 19 September 1783, the A\u00e9rostat R\u00e9veillon was flown with the first living beings in a basket attached to the balloon: a sheep called Montauciel (\"Climb-to-the-sky\"), a duck and a rooster. The sheep was believed to have a reasonable approximation of human physiology. The duck was expected to be unharmed by being lifted and was included as a control for effects created by the aircraft rather than the altitude. The rooster was included as a further control as it was a bird that did not fly at high altitudes. The demonstration was performed at the royal palace in Versailles, before King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette and a crowd.[7]  The flight lasted approximately eight minutes, covered two miles (3\u00a0km), and obtained an altitude of about 1,500 feet (460\u00a0m). The craft landed safely after flying.\n Since the animals survived, the king allowed flights with humans. Again in collaboration with R\u00e9veillon, \u00c9tienne built a 60,000-cubic-foot (1,700\u00a0m3) balloon for the purpose of making flights with humans. It was about 23 m (75 feet) tall and about 15 m (50 feet) in diameter. R\u00e9veillon supplied rich decorative touches of gold figures on a deep blue background, including fleur-de-lis, signs of the zodiac, and suns with Louis XVI's face in the center interlaced with the royal monogram in the central section. Red and blue drapery and golden eagles were at the base of the balloon. \u00c9tienne Montgolfier was the first human to lift off the Earth, making a tethered test flight from the yard of the R\u00e9veillon workshop in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, most likely on 15 October 1783. A little while later on that same day, physicist Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier became the second to ascend into the air, to an altitude of 80 feet (24\u00a0m), which was the length of the tether.[8][9]\n On 21 November 1783, the first free flight by humans was made by Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier, together with an army officer, the marquis d'Arlandes.[10] The flight began from the grounds of the Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette close to the Bois de Boulogne park in the western outskirts of Paris. They flew about 3,000 feet (910\u00a0m) above Paris for a distance of nine kilometers. After 25 minutes, the balloon landed between the windmills, outside the city ramparts, on the Butte-aux-Cailles. Enough fuel remained on board at the end of the flight to have allowed the balloon to fly four to five times as far. However, burning embers from the fire were scorching the balloon fabric and had to be daubed out with sponges. As it appeared it could destroy the balloon, Pil\u00e2tre took off his coat to stop the fire.[citation needed]\n The early flights made a sensation. Numerous engravings commemorated the events. Chairs were designed with balloon backs, and mantel clocks were produced in enamel and gilt-bronze replicas set with a dial in the balloon. One could buy crockery decorated with naive pictures of balloons.[citation needed]\n In December 1783, father Pierre Montgolfier was elevated to the nobility and the hereditary appellation of de Montgolfier by King Louis XVI of France. \n Some claim that the hot air balloon was invented about 74 years earlier by the Brazilian/Portuguese priest Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o.[11] A description of his invention was published in 1709(?) in Vienna, and another one was found in the Vatican in about 1917.[12] \nHowever, this claim is not generally recognized by aviation historians outside the Portuguese-speaking community, in particular the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale.\n On 1 December 1783, a few months after the Montgolfiers' first flight, Jacques Alexandre C\u00e9sar Charles rose to an altitude of about 3\u00a0km (1.9\u00a0mi) near Paris in a hydrogen filled balloon he had developed.\n In early 1784, the Flesselles balloon, named after the unfortunate Jacques de Flesselles, later to be an early casualty at the Bastille, gave a rough landing to its passengers.[13]\n In June 1784, the Gustave (a hot air balloon christened La Gustave in honour of King Gustav III of Sweden's visit to Lyon ) saw the first (singing) female aeronaut, \u00c9lisabeth Thible.\n Both brothers invented a process to manufacture transparent paper looking like vellum, reproducing the technique of the English, followed by the papermakers Johannot and R\u00e9veillon.[14]\nIn 1796, Joseph Michel Montgolfier invented the first self-acting hydraulic ram, a water pump to raise water for his paper mill at Voiron.[15] In 1772, the British clockmaker John Whitehurst had invented its precursor, the \"pulsation engine\".  \nIn 1797, Montgolfier's friend Matthew Boulton took out a British patent on his behalf.\n In 1816, Joseph Michel's sons obtained a British patent for an improved version of the pump.[16]\n Both brothers were freemasons in Les Neuf Soeurs lodge in Paris.[17]\n In 1799, Etienne de Montgolfier died on the way from Lyon to Annonay.[18] His son-in-law, Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Barou de la Lombardi\u00e8re de Canson (1774\u20131859), succeeded him as the head of the company, thanks to his marriage with Alexandrine de Montgolfier. The company became \"Montgolfier et Canson\" in 1801, then \"Canson-Montgolfier\" in 1807. In 1810, Joseph-Michel died in Balaruc-les-Bains.[18]\n The Montgolfier Company in Annonay still exists under the name Canson. It produces fine art papers, school drawing papers and digital fine art and photography papers  sold in 150 countries.[2]\n In 1983, the Montgolfier brothers were inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.[19]\n  Media related to Montgolfier brothers at Wikimedia Commons\n ", "tags": ["Montgolfier brothers", "French balloonists", "18th-century French businesspeople", "Sibling duos", "People of the Industrial Revolution", "Aviation inventors", "French inventors", "Aviation pioneers", "Papermakers", "People from Ard\u00e8che", "Aviation history of France", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "18th-century aviation", "Les Neuf S\u0153urs", "French Freemasons", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles containing French-language text", "Articles with French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with Latin-language sources (la)", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from February 2012", "All articles needing additional references", "Use dmy dates from March 2017", "Articles with hCards", "No local image but image on Wikidata", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from September 2019", "Articles with unsourced statements from July 2017", "Commons category link is on Wikidata"], "raw": "French inventor siblings\nFor the British band, see The Montgolfier Brothers.\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
