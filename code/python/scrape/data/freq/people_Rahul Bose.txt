D'Cunha's aunt was the casting director for director Dev Benegal's film English, August and suggested that Bose should play the lead role. After filming a screen test, Benegal decided to cast him as civil servant Agastya Sen.[4] Based on the novel of the same name by Upamanyu Chatterjee, English, August was one of the first Hinglish films and gained Bose international recognition when it became the first Indian film to be purchased by 20th Century Fox and won several awards at international film festivals.[7]\n After English, August Bose found work in television; he was offered a role in India's first English-language television serial, A Mouthful of Sky and also co-hosted BBC World's Style! with Laila Rouass. In 1998 he appeared in Kaizad Gustad's Bombay Boys with Naseeruddin Shah and starred in Dev Benegal's second film, Split Wide Open. To prepare for his role as a roving water vendor, Bose lived in Mumbai's slums and observed a drug dealer for two weeks.[8] He later cited this time\u2014along with the 2002 Gujarat riots\u2014as the beginning of the awakening of his social conscience.[9] Although Split Wide Open was controversial in India because of its depictions of sexual abuse,[10][11] Bose received the Silver Screen Award for Best Asian Actor at the 2000 Singapore International Film Festival for his performance.[5] He also performed abroad in the Leicester Haymarket in England where he starred in the English version of Tim Murari's play, The Square Circle.[12][13]\n In 1997, Bose was cast to play the role of Saleem Sinai in the BBC adaptation of Salman Rushdie's novel Midnight's Children. The project was eventually canceled after the Indian and Sri Lankan governments refused to allow filming.[14]\nAfter seeing Bose in English, August, director Govind Nihalani cast him in the villain role opposite Ajay Devgan in the mainstream film Thakshak. The film was not a financial success,[15] although Bose received positive reviews.[16]\n Bose also appeared as \"Vikal\" a villain in the 1998 Science fiction TV series Captain Vyom\n In 2001, Bose made his directorial debut with Everybody Says I'm Fine!.

The film, a critique of communal violence, was a critical success and won several awards at international film festivals as well as three National Film Awards.[18][19]\n In 2003, Bose entered mainstream Bollywood cinema with Jhankaar Beats in which he played one of two friends, R.D. Burman fans who are obsessed with winning a music competition.

He starred in Chameli opposite Kareena Kapoor, playing a wealthy chain-smoking Mumbai banker who is stranded in the monsoon rains with a prostitute.
