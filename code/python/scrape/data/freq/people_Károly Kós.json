He was drafted the following year, but soon discharged on request from the Ministry of Culture. Between 1917 and 1918, he was sent on a study trip to Istanbul.[1] In 1918, K\u00f3s was asked to be a professor of the College for Applied Arts of Budapest, but he declined, wishing to return to Transylvania.\n He lived off commissions and started a political career, choosing, unlike many in the Hungarian community, to accept the Romanian Kingdom's administration in the region as a given, while engaging in active opposition inside its legal framework (and authoring a manifesto calling on others to do the same).[2] Alongside Lajos Albrecht and others, he was one of the founders of the Transylvanian People's Party in 1921 \u2014 the group later formed the Magyar Party.[1] K\u00f3s also edited its illustrated political journal Vas\u00e1rnap.[1]\n In 1924, he and several of his friends founded a publishing house under the name Erd\u00e9lyi Sz\u00e9pm\u00edves C\u00e9h (\"Transylvanian Guild of Fine Arts\"). From 1931, he was editor of the Erd\u00e9lyi Helikon, and manager of the Mikl\u00f3s Barab\u00e1s Guild (an independent interest group of Hungarian artists in Romania).\n In 1944 his house in Szt\u00e1na (part of Northern Transylvania) was plundered, and he fled to Kolozsv\u00e1r, where he rejoined his family. He was director of the Transylvanian Hungarian Economic Association. As a politician, he was the president of the Hungarian People's Union (Magyar N\u00e9pi Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9g, MNSz), and afterwards member of the Assembly of Deputies (1946\u201348).[1]\n K\u00f3s taught at the College for Agriculture in Cluj until 1953, filling the post of the dean in 1945, and contributed to the journal Vil\u00e1goss\u00e1g between 1948\u201349.
