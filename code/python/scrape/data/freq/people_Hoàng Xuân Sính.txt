Her mother died when she was eight years old, and she was raised by a stepmother. She has also frequently been said to be the granddaughter of Vietnamese mathematician Ho\u00e0ng Xu\u00e2n H\u00e3n. She completed a bachelor's degree in 1951 in Hanoi, studying English and French, and then traveled to Paris for a second baccalaureate in mathematics.[2] She stayed in France to study for an agr\u00e9gation at the University of Toulouse, which she completed in 1959, before returning to Vietnam to become a mathematics teacher at the Hanoi National University of Education.[3] Ho\u00e0ng became the first female mathematician in Vietnam[3] and at that time was one of a very small number of mathematicians there with a foreign education.[4]\n The French mathematician and pacifist Alexander Grothendieck visited North Vietnam in late 1967, during the Vietnam War, and spent a month teaching mathematics to the Hanoi University mathematics department staff,[5] including Ho\u00e0ng, who took the notes for the lectures.[4] Because of the war, Grothendieck's lectures were held away from Hanoi, first in the nearby countryside and later in \u0110\u1ea1i T\u1eeb. After Grothendieck returned to France, he continued to teach Ho\u00e0ng as a correspondence student.[5] She earned her doctorate under Grothendieck's supervision from Paris Diderot University in 1975, with a handwritten thesis.[6][7] Her thesis research, on algebraic structures based on categorical groups but with a group law that holds only up to isomorphism, prefigured much of the modern theory of 2-groups.[8]\n When she was promoted to full professor Ho\u00e0ng became the first female full professor in Vietnam in any scientific or technical field.[9] In 1988 she founded the first private university in Vietnam, Thang Long University in Hanoi,[10] and became the president of its board of directors.[3][11]\n In 2003 she was awarded France's Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques for her \"contributions to boosting cooperation in culture and science between the two nations\" of France and Vietnam.[3][12]\n ", "tags": ["1933 births", "Living people", "Vietnamese mathematicians", "Women mathematicians", "Algebraic geometers", "People from Hanoi", "CS1 Vietnamese-language sources (vi)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Vietnamese mathematician\nHo\u00e0ng Xu\u00e2n S\u00ednh (born September 8, 1933)[1] is a Vietnamese mathematician, a student of Grothendieck, the first female mathematician in Vietnam, the founder of Thang Long University, and the recipient of the Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and career\n2 Work with Grothendieck\n3 Later accomplishments\n4 Recognition\n5 References\n\n\nEarly life and career[edit]\nHo\u00e0ng was born in C\u00f3t, in the T\u1eeb Li\u00eam District of Vietnam, one of seven children of fabric merchant Ho\u00e0ng Thuc Tan.
