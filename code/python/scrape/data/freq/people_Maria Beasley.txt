She is best known for her barrel-making machines and her improvements to the life raft, and she held fifteen different patents in the United States and two in Great Britain.[2]\n Maria Beasley was born as Maria Kenney in 1847 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Much of her early life is unknown, including her date of birth, her family, and her early education and upbringing. In 1865 she married a man named Samuel Beasley and changed her name to Maria Beasley. During her later life she was first credited as a dressmaker and later an inventor. She filed over a dozen patents throughout her lifetime, including fifteen in the United States and two in Britain, between the late 1870s to the late 1890s. She died in 1891 at age 73 or 74. \n Most of Beasley\u2019s inventions were machines and employed her engineering knowledge. Her inventions were diverse, with some of them addressing d ay-to-day pain points such as cooking needs with her patented pots and pans. Other of Beasley\u2019s inventions included patents that ended up saving lives later on. Several of her inventions involving strides to making transportation safer and more reliable both on ground and over sea. \n Beasley started her career as a dressmaker. Many speculate that she was encouraged to start her career as an engineer and innovator by the Centennial Exhibit, more specifically the Women\u2019s Pavilion.

Her improvements to the existing design of the lifeboat ensured that the raft would be air-tight to protect any provisions, and also ensured that lowering the boat into the water would be easy and harmless to the boat. Beyond improving the existing hardware, she added two features that were brand new to the design.[1] This design would go on to save hundreds of lives in later years. Beasley\u2019s life raft was used on the RMS Titanic on its fateful voyage in April of 1912.
