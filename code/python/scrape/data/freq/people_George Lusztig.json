{"name": "George Lusztig", "content": "George Lusztig (born Gheorghe Lusztig; May 20, 1946) is an American-Romanian mathematician and Abdun Nur Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He was a Norbert Wiener Professor in the Department of Mathematics from 1999 to 2009.\n Born in Timi\u0219oara to a Hungarian-Jewish family,[1] he did his undergraduate studies at the University of Bucharest, graduating in 1968. Later that year he left Romania for the United Kingdom, where he spent several months at the University of Warwick and Oxford University. In 1969 he moved to the United States, where he went to work for two years with Michael Atiyah at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1971 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \"Novikov's higher signature and families of elliptic operators\", under the supervision of William Browder and Michael Atiyah.[2][3]\n Lusztig worked for almost seven years at the University of Warwick. His involvement at the university encompassed a Research Fellowship, (1971\u201372); lecturer in Mathematics, (1972\u201374); and Professor of Mathematics, (1974\u201378). In 1978, he accepted a chair at MIT.[4][1]\n He is known for his work on representation theory, in particular for the objects closely related to algebraic groups, such as finite reductive groups, Hecke algebras, \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n-adic groups, quantum groups, and Weyl groups. He essentially paved the way for modern representation theory. This has included fundamental new concepts, including the character sheaves, the Deligne\u2013Lusztig varieties, and the Kazhdan\u2013Lusztig polynomials.[5]\n In 1983, Lusztig was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society.[4] In 1985 Lusztig won the Cole Prize (Algebra). He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1992, received the Brouwer Medal in 1999 and received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement in Mathematics in 2008. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society[6] and in 2014 he received the Shaw Prize in Mathematics.[7] He also received the National Order of Faithful Service in 2003.\n ", "tags": ["Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "20th-century Romanian mathematicians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Princeton University alumni", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Brouwer Medalists", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "University of Bucharest alumni", "Romanian Jews", "Romanian emigrants to the United States", "Scientists from Timi\u0219oara", "Academics of the University of Warwick", "Highly Cited Researchers", "1946 births", "Living people", "International Mathematical Olympiad participants", "21st-century Romanian mathematicians", "Recipients of the National Order of Faithful Service", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " American mathematician\nGeorge LusztigBorn (1946-05-20) May 20, 1946 (age\u00a074)Timi\u0219oara, Kingdom of RomaniaCitizenshipRomanian, British, AmericanAlma\u00a0materPrinceton University (Ph.D) (1971)University of BucharestAwardsBerwick Prize (1977)Cole Prize (1985) Leroy P.
