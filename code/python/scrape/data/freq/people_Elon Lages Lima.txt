Lima graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the Universidade do Brasil (today UFRJ) in 1953.

He is a professor Honoris Causa of the Universidade Federal do Cear\u00e1 and of the University of Bras\u00edlia. He was a member of the Upper Board of FAPERJ from 1987 to 1991. He was also a member of the National Board of Education.\n He wrote over thirty books in mathematics, some of which were intended for secondary school teachers.
