Her mother, who completed grade seven, loved planting and growing trees, flowers and gardens so while the trees have been called \"the finest stand of trees in Eastern Alberta\", the paying crops did not pay so well. Myrna spent hours each summer, as a small child, carrying water to the trees. She was the tallest of four sisters and that may be why she was chosen to be the farm worker of the bunch.
