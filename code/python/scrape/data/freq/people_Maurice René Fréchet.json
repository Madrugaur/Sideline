{"name": "Maurice Ren\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chet", "content": "\n Maurice Ren\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chet (French:\u00a0[m\u0254\u0281is \u0281\u0259ne f\u0281e\u0283e, mo\u0281-]; 2 September 1878 \u2013 4 June 1973) was a French mathematician. He made major contributions to the topology of point sets and introduced the entire concept of metric spaces. He also made several important contributions to the field of statistics and probability, as well as calculus. His dissertation opened the entire field of functionals on metric spaces and introduced the notion of compactness. Independently of Riesz, he discovered the representation theorem in the space of Lebesgue square integrable functions.\n He was born to a Protestant family in Maligny to Jacques and Zo\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chet. At the time of his birth, his father was a director of a Protestant orphanage in Maligny and was later in his youth appointed a head of a Protestant school. However, the newly established Third Republic was not sympathetic to religious education and so the laws were enacted requiring all education to be secular. As a result, his father lost his job. To generate some income his mother set up a boarding house for foreigners in Paris. His father was able later to obtain another teaching position within the secular system \u2013 it was not a job of a headship, however, and the family could not expect as high standards as they might have otherwise.\n Maurice attended the secondary school Lyc\u00e9e Buffon in Paris where he was taught mathematics by Jacques Hadamard. Hadamard recognised the potential of young Maurice and decided to tutor him on an individual basis. After Hadamard moved to the University of Bordeaux in 1894, Hadamard continuously wrote to Fr\u00e9chet, setting him mathematical problems and harshly criticising his errors. Much later Fr\u00e9chet admitted that the problems caused him to live in a continual fear of not being able to solve some of them, even though he was very grateful for the special relationship with Hadamard he was privileged to enjoy.\n After completing high-school Fr\u00e9chet was required to enroll in the military service. This is the time when he was deciding whether to study mathematics or physics \u2013 he chose mathematics out of dislike of chemistry classes he would have had to take otherwise. Thus in 1900 he enrolled to \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure to study mathematics.\n He started publishing quite early, having published four papers in 1903. He also published some of his early papers in the American Mathematical Society due to his contact with American mathematicians in Paris\u2014particularly Edwin Wilson.\n Fr\u00e9chet served at many different institutions during his academic career. From 1907\u20131908 he served as a professor of mathematics at the Lyc\u00e9e in Besan\u00e7on, then moved in 1908 to the Lyc\u00e9e in Nantes to stay there for a year. After that he served at the University of Poitiers between 1910\u20131919.\n He married in 1908 to Suzanne Carrive (1881\u20131945) and had four children: H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, Henri, Denise and Alain.\n Fr\u00e9chet was planning to spend a year in the United States at the University of Illinois but his plan was disrupted when the First World War broke out in 1914. He was mobilised on 4 August the same year. Because of his diverse language skills, gained when his mother ran the establishment for foreigners, he served as an interpreter for the British Army. However, this was not a safe job; he spent two and a half years very near to or at the front. French egalitarian ideals caused many academics to be mobilised. They served in the trenches and many of them were lost during the war. It is remarkable that during his service in the war, he still managed to produce cutting edge mathematical papers frequently, despite having little time to devote to mathematics.\n After the end of the war, Fr\u00e9chet was chosen to go to Strasbourg to help with the reestablishment of the university. He served as a professor of higher analysis and Director of the Mathematics Institute. Despite being burdened with administrative work, he was again able to produce a large amount of high quality research.\n In 1928 Fr\u00e9chet decided to move back to Paris, thanks to encouragement from Borel, who was then Chair in the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics at the Sorbonne. Fr\u00e9chet briefly held a position of lecturer at the Sorbonne's Rockefeller Foundation and from 1928 was a Professor (without a Chair). Fr\u00e9chet was promoted to tenured Chair of General Mathematics in 1933 and to Chair of Differential and Integral Calculus in 1935. In 1941 Fr\u00e9chet succeeded Borel as Chair in the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics, a position Fr\u00e9chet held until he retired in 1949. From 1928 to 1935 Fr\u00e9chet was also put in charge of lectures at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure; in this latter capacity Fr\u00e9chet was able to direct a significant number of young mathematicians toward research in probability, including Doeblin, Fortet, Loeve, and Ville.[1]\n Despite his major achievements, Fr\u00e9chet was not overly appreciated in France. As an illustration, while being nominated numerous times, he was not elected a member of the Academy of Sciences until the age of 78.[citation needed] In 1929 he became foreign member of the Polish Academy of Science and Arts and in 1950 foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[2]\n Fr\u00e9chet was an Esperantist, publishing some papers and articles in that constructed language.[3] He also served as president of the Internacia Scienca Asocio Esperantista (\"International Scientific Esperantist Association\") from 1950\u201353.[4]\n His first major work was his outstanding 1906 PhD thesis Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel, on the calculus of functionals. Here Fr\u00e9chet introduced the concept of a metric space, although the name is due to Hausdorff. Fr\u00e9chet's level of abstraction is similar to that in group theory, proving theorems within a carefully chosen axiomatic system which can then be applied to a large array of particular cases.\n Here is a list of his most important works, in chronological order:\n Fr\u00e9chet also developed[6]  ideas from the article Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique[7] (1938; an English translation The Two Fundamental Types of Statistical Distribution) of Czech geographer, demographer and statistician Jarom\u00edr Kor\u010d\u00e1k.\n Fr\u00e9chet is sometimes credited with the introduction of what is now known as the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound, but Fr\u00e9chet's 1940s lecture notes on the topic appear to have been lost.[8]\n In 1908 he married Suzanne Carrive.[9]\n ", "tags": ["Functional analysts", "Probability theorists", "French statisticians", "1878 births", "1973 deaths", "People from Yonne", "20th-century French mathematicians", "French Protestants", "Mathematical analysts", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni", "Lyc\u00e9e Buffon alumni", "University of Strasbourg faculty", "University of Poitiers faculty", "Fellows of the Econometric Society", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences", "French Esperantists", "Articles with Esperanto-language sources (eo)", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from May 2013", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from August 2014", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French mathematician\n\n\nMaurice Ren\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chetMaurice Ren\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chetBorn(1878-09-02)2 September 1878Maligny, FranceDied4 June 1973(1973-06-04) (aged\u00a094)Paris, FranceNationalityFrenchAlma\u00a0mater\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieureKnown\u00a0forMetric spaces, functional analysisScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of BordeauxUniversity of Strasbourg\u00c9cole des Hautes-\u00c9tudes\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieureDoctoral advisorJacques HadamardDoctoral studentsNachman AronszajnRobert Fortet\u0110uro KurepaKy FanAntonio Monteiro\n\nMaurice Ren\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chet (French:\u00a0[m\u0254\u0281is \u0281\u0259ne f\u0281e\u0283e, mo\u0281-]; 2 September 1878 \u2013 4 June 1973) was a French mathematician.
