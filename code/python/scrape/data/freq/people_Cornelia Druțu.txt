Under the Continuum Hypothesis, a finitely generated group may have at most continuously many non-homeomorphic asymptotic cones, hence the result is sharp.\nA characterization of Kazhdan's property (T) and of the Haagerup property using affine isometric actions on median spaces.\nA study of generalizations of Kazhdan's property (T) for uniformly convex Banach spaces.\nA proof that random groups satisfy strengthened versions of Kazhdan's property (T) for high enough density; a proof that for random groups the conformal dimension of the boundary is connected to the maximal value of p for which the groups have fixed point properties for isometric affine actions on \n\n\n\n\nL\n\np\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L^{p}}\n\n spaces.\nSelected publications (in the order corresponding to the results above)[edit]\nDru\u0163u, Cornelia (2009). \"Relatively hyperbolic groups: geometry and quasi-isometric invariance\".
