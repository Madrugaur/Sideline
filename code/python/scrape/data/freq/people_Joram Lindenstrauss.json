He was a professor of mathematics at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.[1]\n Joram Lindenstrauss was born in Tel Aviv.[2] He was the only child of a pair of lawyers who immigrated to Israel from Berlin. He began to study mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1954 while serving in the army. He became a full-time student in 1956 and received his master's degree in 1959. In 1962 Lindenstrauss earned his Ph.D. from the Hebrew University (dissertation: Extension of Compact Operators, advisors: Aryeh Dvoretzky, Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum).[3] He worked as a postdoc at Yale University and the University of Washington in Seattle from 1962 - 1965. He was appointed senior lecturer at the Hebrew University in 1965, associate professor on 1967 and full professor in 1969. He became the Leon H. and Ada G. Miller Memorial Professor of Mathematics in 1985.[2] He retired in 2005.\n Lindenstrauss was married to theoretical computer scientist Naomi Lindenstrauss. Two of their children, Ayelet Lindenstrauss and Fields Medallist Elon Lindenstrauss, are also mathematicians (providing a rare example of  father, mother, son and daughter all having papers listed in Mathematical Reviews).[2] Joram was also the cousin of Micha Lindenstrauss.\n Lindenstrauss worked in various areas of functional analysis and geometry,[4] particularly Banach space theory, finite- and infinite-dimensional convexity, geometric nonlinear functional analysis and geometric measure theory.[2] He authored more than 100 papers as well as several books in Banach space theory.[5]\n Among his results is the Johnson\u2013Lindenstrauss lemma which concerns low-distortion embeddings of points from high-dimensional into low-dimensional Euclidean space. Another of his theorems states that  in a Banach space with the Radon\u2013Nikodym property, a closed and bounded set has an extreme point; compactness is not needed.[6]\n In 1981 Lindenstrauss was awarded the Israel Prize, for mathematics.[7] In 1997, Lindenstrauss was the first mathematician from outside Poland to be awarded the Stefan Banach Medal of the Polish Academy of Sciences.[8]\n ", "tags": ["1936 births", "2012 deaths", "20th-century mathematicians", "Functional analysts", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty", "Israeli Jews", "Israeli mathematicians", "Israeli people of German-Jewish descent", "Israel Prize in mathematics recipients", "Members of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "People from Tel Aviv", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from November 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1 maint: ref=harv", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Joram Lindenstrauss\u05d9\u05d5\u05e8\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9\u05e0\u05d3\u05e0\u05e9\u05d8\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05e1Joram Lindenstrauss, 1975Born(1936-10-28)October 28, 1936Tel Aviv, Mandatory PalestineDiedApril 29, 2012(2012-04-29) (aged\u00a075)Resting placeHar HaMenuchotAlma\u00a0materHebrew University of JerusalemAwardsIsrael Prize (1981)Scientific careerInstitutionsEinstein Institute of MathematicsDoctoral advisorsAryeh DvoretzkyBranko Gr\u00fcnbaumDoctoral studentsAssaf Naor, Gideon Schechtman\n\nJoram Lindenstrauss (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d5\u05e8\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9\u05e0\u05d3\u05e0\u05e9\u05d8\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05e1\u200e) (October 28, 1936 \u2013 April 29, 2012) was an Israeli mathematician working in functional analysis.
