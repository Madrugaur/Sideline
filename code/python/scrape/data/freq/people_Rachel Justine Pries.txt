{"name": "Rachel Justine Pries", "content": "Rachel Justine Pries  is an American mathematician whose research focuses on arithmetic geometry and number theory.   She is a Professor at Colorado State University and a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[1]\n Pries was a student at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[2] She received a B.S. degree from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island in 1994,[3] and received a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 2000 under the supervision of David Harbater.[4]\n After her doctoral studies, Pries was appointed a National Science Foundation VIGRE post-doctoral fellow at Columbia University for 2000 to 2003.  After her post-doc at Columbia, Rachel joined the faculty at Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado,  where she is currently a full professor.[5]\n In one of her most cited works, Families of wildly ramified covers of curves,[6] Pries studied smooth Galois covers of curves, ramified over only one point. In a second highly cited paper, Hyperelliptic curves with prescribed p-torsion,[7] Pries and co-author Darren Glass, proved several results regarding the existence of Jacobian varieties having interesting p-torsion as measured in terms of invariants such as the p-rank and the a-number.\n Pries serves on the Steering Committee of Women in Number Theory (WIN),[8] a research collaboration community for women mathematicians interested in number theory. She was an editor of Directions in Number Theory: Proceedings of the 2014 WIN3 Workshop (Association for Women in Mathematics Series), which was published by Springer Verlag in 2016.[9]\n Pries was elected to the 2018 class of fellows of the American Mathematical Society.
