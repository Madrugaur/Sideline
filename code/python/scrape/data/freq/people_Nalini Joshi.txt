{"name": "Nalini Joshi", "content": "\n Nalini Joshi AO is an Australian mathematician. She is a professor in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Sydney, the first woman in the School to hold this position, and is a past-president of the Australian Mathematical Society.[1]\n[2]\nJoshi is a member of the School's Applied Mathematics Research Group. Her research concerns integrable systems. She was awarded the Georgina Sweet Australian Laureate Fellowship in 2012.[3]\n Joshi was born and spent her childhood in Burma.\nIn 2007, she described her experience growing up there:\n My father was in the army and I grew up near jungles with wild animals. I had the freedom to explore all day long so long as I went to school and that's what I actually seek every time I look at mathematics; it's an adventure, an exploration, forging new paths into territories nobody else has looked at before. Joshi gained her Bachelor of Science with honours in 1980 at the University of Sydney, and her PhD at Princeton University under the supervision of Martin David Kruskal.[1]\n[4]\nHer PhD thesis was entitled The Connection Problem for the First and Second Painlev\u00e9 Transcendents.[5]\n After a postdoctoral fellowship in 1987 and a research fellowship and lectureship (1988\u201390), both at the Australian National University, Joshi took up a lectureship at the University of New South Wales in Sydney (1990\u201394) and was promoted to senior lecturer in 1994.\nIn 1997, she won an Australian Research Council (ARC) senior research fellowship, which she took up at the University of Adelaide, and became an associate professor/reader at that university a year later.\nIn 2002 she moved to the University of Sydney as Chair of Applied Mathematics; since 2006 she has been director of the Centre for Mathematical Biology, from 2007 to 2009 head of the School of Mathematics and Statistics (associate head since 2010).[6]\n In 2015, Joshi co-founded and co-chaired the Science in Australia Gender Equity (SAGE) program, which works to increase retention of women in STEM fields using Athena SWAN principles.[7]\nSince 2016, she has served as a member of the SAGE Expert Advisory Group.[8]\n Joshi was elected a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in March 2008, and has held a number of positions in the Australian Mathematical Society, including its presidency from December 2008 to September 2010.\nShe was also a board member of the Australian Mathematics Trust (2010\u201313)\nShe has been on the National Committee for Mathematical Sciences since January 2010.[6]\n In 2012, Joshi became a Georgina Sweet Australian Laureate Fellow, which involves the five-year project, Geometric construction of critical solutions of nonlinear systems.[3][9][10][11]\n In 2015, she was the 150th Anniversary Hardy Lecturer, an award by the London Mathematical Society involving an extensive series of lectures throughout the United Kingdom.[12] She is a Fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales (FRSN).[13] In June 2016, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia.[14]\n Joshi was elected vice-president of the International Mathematical Union in July 2018.
