She grew up in Los Angeles, where her interest in mathematics was sparked by winning a fourth-grade mathematics contest.[1] She was the valedictorian of Palos Verdes Peninsula High School in 1996,[2] and while there participated in summer research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with Satomi Okazaki, a student of her eventual advisor, Richard P. Stanley.[1] She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in 2000 with a A.B. in mathematics,[2] and received her PhD in 2005 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the supervision of Stanley.[3] Her dissertation was titled Combinatorial Aspects of Total Positivity.\n After postdoctoral positions at the University of California, Berkeley and Harvard, Williams rejoined the Berkeley mathematics department as an assistant professor in 2009, and was promoted to associate professor in 2013 and then full professor in 2016.[2]\n Starting in the fall of 2018, she rejoined the Harvard mathematics department as a full professor, making her the second ever tenured female math professor at Harvard.
