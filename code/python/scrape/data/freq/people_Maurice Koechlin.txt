{"name": "Maurice Koechlin", "content": "Maurice Koechlin (8 March 1856 \u2013 14 January 1946) was a Franco-Swiss structural engineer from the Koechlin family.\n A member of the renowned Alsatian Koechlin family, he was born in Buhl, Haut-Rhin, the son of Jean Koechlin and his wife Anne Marie (Ana\u00efs), n\u00e9e Beuck. He was the first cousin once removed of Andr\u00e9 Koechlin, and the great-grandfather of actress Kalki Koechlin.\n When France lost the Franco-Prussian war to Prussia in 1870/1871 the Koechlin family as a whole decided to become citizens of Switzerland and thus dropped French citizenship. After the defeat of the German Empire in 1918, however, the Koechlin family again applied for French citizenship.[1]\n Maurice studied at the lyc\u00e9e in Mulhouse, then between 1873 and 1877 civil engineering at the Polytechnikum Z\u00fcrich under Carl Culmann. In 1876 he became a citizen of Zurich (\"Z\u00fcrcher B\u00fcrger\")[2]\nBetween 1877 and 1879 he worked for the French railway company \"Chemin de Fer de l'Est\".\n Much of his work was done for Gustave Eiffel's \"Compagnie des \u00e9tablissements Eiffel\", which Koechlin joined in 1879. In 1886 Maurice married Emma Rossier (1867-1965). They had six children: three sons and three daughters. Maurice and Emma were lifelong members of the Plymouth Brethren.\n In 1887 he started work on his plans for the \"Tour de 300 m\u00e8tres\" in Paris, along with his younger brother Henri Koechlin and civil engineer \u00c9mile Nouguier. Maurice Koechlin became the Managing Director of Eiffel's company when Eiffel retired from the engineering profession in 1893. The company was renamed Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de construction de Levallois-Perret.[3]\n Maurice Koechlin died in 1946 in Veytaux, Switzerland in a house built by himself in 1900.[4]\n Major structural designs include:\n  Though named after a project of Gustave Eiffel, the Eiffel Tower\u00a0\u2013 symbol of Paris\u00a0\u2013 has its structural concept and form from the responsible chief engineer Maurice Koechlin.\nKoechlin was an engineer of outstanding ingenuity and well versed in the structural techniques of his time. He possessed therefore the best qualifications for evolving such technically innovative conceptions for which Eiffel and his firm were renowned.
