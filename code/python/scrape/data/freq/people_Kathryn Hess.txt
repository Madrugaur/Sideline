{"name": "Kathryn Hess", "content": "\n Kathryn Hess (born 1967)[1] is a professor of mathematics at \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) and is known for her work on homotopy theory, category theory, and algebraic topology, both pure and applied. In particular, she applies the methods of algebraic topology to better understanding neurology[2], cancer biology, and materials science. She is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.\n Kathryn Hess was born 21 September 1967 in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. She began to accelerate in mathematics in 1979, thanks to the Mathematical Talent Development Project (MTDP) set up in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, by her parents, through the Association for High Potential Children, which they also founded. Both programs are defunct at this point. Hess earned a BSc with honors in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1985.[2]  She received her doctorate in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1989 under the direction of David J.
