In 1988 Eliashberg moved to the United States, and since 1989 he has been a professor of mathematics at Stanford University.\n Eliashberg received the Leningrad Mathematical Society Prize in 1972. In 1986,[3] 1998[4] and 2006 (plenary lecture)[5] he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians. He delivered many invited series of lectures around the world. In 1995 Eliashberg was a recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship.\n In 2001 he was awarded the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry from the AMS for his work in symplectic and contact topology. In particular for his proof of the symplectic rigidity and the development of 3-dimensional contact topology. In 2009 he received the Doctorat Honoris Causa from the ENS Lyon and in 2017 the Doctorat Honoris Causa from the University of Uppsala. In 2013 Eliashberg shared with Helmut Hofer the Heinz Hopf Prize from the ETH, Zurich, for their pioneering research in symplectic topology. In 2002 Eliashberg was elected to the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[6] He also was a member of the Selection Committee in mathematical sciences Shaw Prize.\n In 2016 Yakov Eliashberg was awarded the Crafoord Prize in Mathematics from the Swedish Academy of Sciences for the development of contact and symplectic topology and groundbreaking discoveries of rigidity and flexibility phenomena. In 2020 he received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics (jointly with Simon K. Donaldson).[7]\n ", "tags": ["1946 births", "Living people", "People from Saint Petersburg", "Russian mathematicians", "Jewish Russian scientists", "Saint Petersburg State University alumni", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Topologists", "Stanford University Department of Mathematics faculty", "CS1: long volume value", "BLP articles lacking sources from December 2012", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.
