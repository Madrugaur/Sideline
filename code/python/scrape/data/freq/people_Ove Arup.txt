{"name": "Ove Arup", "content": "\n Sir Ove Nyquist Arup, CBE, MICE, MIStructE, FCIOB (16 April 1895\u00a0\u2013 5 February 1988) was a Danish-English engineer who founded Arup Group Limited, a multinational corporation that offers engineering, design, planning, project management, and consulting services for building systems.[1] Ove Arup is considered to be among the foremost architectural structural engineers of his time.\n Arup was born in Newcastle, England, in 1895,[2] to the Danish veterinary surgeon Jens Simon Johannes Arup and his Norwegian wife Mathilde Bolette Nyquist. Arup attended the Sor\u00f8 Academy in Denmark\u2014a boarding school with many influences from Dr. Thomas Arnold of the Rugby School in the United Kingdom.\n In 1913, he began studying philosophy at University of Copenhagen and in 1918 enrolled for an engineering degree at the Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen,[3] specialising in reinforced concrete. He completed his studies in 1922. At this time Ove Arup was influenced by Le Corbusier and his publication Vers une architecture, published that year; and also by Walter Gropius, the founder of the Bauhaus movement.\n Arup married Ruth S\u00f8rensen, known as Li, on 13 August 1925.[4]\n In 1922, Ove Arup began work with a Danish firm in Hamburg called Christiani & Nielsen, and in December 1923 he moved to their London office as chief engineer.[5]\n He designed the Labworth Caf\u00e9\u2014a caf\u00e9 with two integrated shelters set on the promenade of the neighbouring Essex seaside resort of Canvey Island. The caf\u00e9 exists as the only building solely designed by Arup.[6] He then worked as a structural consultant to the Tecton partnership, notably on the Penguin Pool at London's Regent's Park Zoo,[7] Whipsnade Zoo, Dudley Zoo, as a construction supervisor for a villa in Heath Drive, Romford, Essex  and on Highpoint I, Highgate (a building he was later highly critical of). The close working relationship that Arup developed with Tecton's senior partner Berthold Lubetkin, proved to be highly important in the development of both men's careers.[5]\n He moved next to a London construction company, J. L. Kier & Co. in London, as director and chief designer from 1934\u201338, and during the 1930s he also worked with Ern\u0151 Goldfinger, Wells Coates, Maxwell Fry, Yorke, Rosenberg & Mardall and Marcel Breuer.[5] He became a member of the executive committee of the MARS Group in 1935. In 1938, he and his cousin Arne founded Arup & Arup Limited, a firm of engineers and contractors.[5]\n Before the war, Ove Arup was on the Air Raid Precautions organising committee and he advised Finsbury Council on the provision of bomb shelters. During the war he published a number of papers on shelter policy and designs, mainly advocating reinforced concrete mass shelters, rather than the government policy of dispersing the population in small domestic shelters. Largely for political reasons most of his recommendations were never adopted, although some wealthy Londoners were able to build concrete shelters according to his design.\n Arup played a significant part in the design of the Mulberry temporary harbours used during the D-Day landings.[5]\nThe Mulberry Harbour was a type of temporary harbour developed to offload cargo on the beaches during the Allied invasion of Normandy. The sections for two prefabricated or artificial military harbours were taken with the invading army from Britain across the English Channel and assembled off the coast of Normandy as part of the D-Day invasion of France in 1944.\n In 1946, after dissolving Arup & Arup Ltd, he created a team of Civil and Structural Engineering consultants. In the same year, he formed his first partnership with Ronald Jenkins, Geoffrey Wood and Andrew Young called Arup and Partners.\n A further company, Arup Associates,[8] was formed in 1963 as a new partnership, a body of Architects and Engineers working on an equal basis as Building Designers:[9] the engineer Ove Arup, the architects Francis Pym and Philip Dowson, and the former partners of Arup and Partners. It was a multi-disciplinary company providing engineering, architectural, and other services for the built environment. Arup said himself that ultimately, all of the Arup names resulted in a firm called simply Arup.[5]\n Highpoint I, built in 1935, was an important experiment in high-rise residential design, and was one of Arup's most significant collaborations with Lubetkin. Arup later criticised the project as having significant flaws.[1]\n Ove Arup personally supervised the design and construction of Durham's Kingsgate Bridge in 1963. The firm's first bridge, Arup was particularly attached to the project and had his ashes scattered from it following his death. A bust of Arup that was placed at one end of the Bridge was stolen in the summer of 2006 but has since been replaced.[2] Kingsgate Bridge was the last structure designed by Arup.[10]\n The mid-century Van Ginkel Footbridge is a cantilever style, meaning the bridge is anchored to the ground on only one end while the other side hovers. The bridge, which hovers off the ground on one end, received heritage designation in 2020.[11] The architect of the bridge was Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, who received the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada's gold medal for lifetime achievement.[11]\n Arup was the design engineer for the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia from the project's start in 1957 to its completion in 1973.[3] An iconic building making groundbreaking use of precast concrete, structural glue and computer analysis,[12] this made Arup's reputation, and that of his firm, despite the extremely difficult working relationship with the architect, J\u00f8rn Utzon.\n ", "tags": ["Ove Arup", "English people of Norwegian descent", "IStructE Gold Medal winners", "Recipients of the Royal Gold Medal", "1895 births", "1988 deaths", "English people of Danish descent", "Commanders of the Order of the British Empire", "British structural engineers", "Knights Bachelor", "People from Newcastle upon Tyne", "Royal Academicians", "University of Copenhagen alumni", "Danish engineers", "Ove Arup buildings and structures", "20th-century engineers", "Pages containing London Gazette template with parameter supp set to y", "EngvarB from September 2013", "Use dmy dates from September 2013", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nSirOve ArupCBEBorn(1895-04-16)16 April 1895Newcastle upon Tyne, EnglandDied5 February 1988(1988-02-05) (aged\u00a092)London, EnglandNationalityEnglish, Danish-bornCitizenshipBritishEducationSor\u00f8 AcademyUniversity of CopenhagenPolyteknisk L\u00e6reanstaltOccupationEngineerSpouse(s)Ruth S\u00f8rensenParent(s)Jens Simon Johannes ArupMathilde Jolette NyquistEngineering careerDisciplineStructural engineerInstitutionsInstitution of Structural EngineersPractice nameArupProjectsSydney Opera HouseCentre PompidouKingsgate BridgeHighpoint ILabworth Caf\u00e9AwardsIStructE Gold MedalRIBA Gold Medal\n\nSir Ove Nyquist Arup, CBE, MICE, MIStructE, FCIOB (16 April 1895\u00a0\u2013 5 February 1988) was a Danish-English engineer who founded Arup Group Limited, a multinational corporation that offers engineering, design, planning, project management, and consulting services for building systems.[1] Ove Arup is considered to be among the foremost architectural structural engineers of his time.\n\nContents\n\n1 Personal life and education\n2 Working life\n\n2.1 Before WWII\n2.2 World War II\n2.3 Arup & Partners\n\n\n3 Notable projects\n\n3.1 Highpoint I\n3.2 Kingsgate Bridge\n3.3 Van Ginkel Footbridge\n3.4 Sydney Opera House\n\n\n4 Honours\n5 Notes\n6 References\n7 Further reading\n8 External links\n\n\nPersonal life and education[edit]\nArup was born in Newcastle, England, in 1895,[2] to the Danish veterinary surgeon Jens Simon Johannes Arup and his Norwegian wife Mathilde Bolette Nyquist.
