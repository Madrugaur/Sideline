He is regarded as one of the most influential architects in South Asia.\n Haq was born in Brahmanbaria (now a district of Bangladesh). His father was a Deputy Collector from the\u00a0Sylhet district and for that reason, Haq spent the majority of his childhood there. He completed his Bachelor of Architecture from the National College of Arts, in Lahore, Pakistan in 1964. He received John Heinrich Tuition, Scholarship and Teaching Assistantship at University of New Mexico, United States in 1971 and completed his masters in architecture from the university in 1975.[1]\n After completing his master's degree, Haq started working for the firm Kallmann McKinnell. He was interested in returning to his homeland. However, another Bangladeshi-American engineer FR Khan discouraged him from returning to Bangladesh citing a newly independent war devastated nation. Khan, who was then the partner of SOM instead interviewed and advised Haq to join there. Khan suggested he visit Europe and return to the USA. But Haq flew to Bangladesh from Europe and started practicing architecture. He established Bashirul Haq & Associates in 1977.[2] After several years of not visiting the United States, in 1989, he visited Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an invited design critic.\n In his 45 years of professional career, Haq has designed more than 300 buildings. According to Haq, the works of Alvar Aalto and Aldo Rossi inspired him most.\n Chhayanaut, Dhaka\n MIDAS Tower, Dhanmondi, Dhaka\n Asra Apartments, Dhanmondi, Dhaka\n East West University, Dhaka\n ", "tags": ["2020 deaths", "1942 births", "Bangladeshi architects", "Fellows of the American Institute of Architects", "Modernist architects", "20th-century American architects", "21st-century architects", "National College of Arts alumni", "University of New Mexico alumni", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "EngvarB from September 2014", "Use dmy dates from September 2014", "Articles with hCards", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "Bangladeshi architect\n\n\nBashirul HaqHaq at studioBorn(1942-06-24)June 24, 1942Brahmanbaria, Bengal Presidency, British India (now Bangladesh)Died4 April 2020(2020-04-04) (aged\u00a077)NationalityBangladeshiAlma\u00a0materNational College of ArtsUniversity of New MexicoOccupationArchitect, Planner, EducatorAwardsIAB Gold MedalAga Khan Award for Architecture Three times nominatedPracticeBashirul Haq and AssociatesBuildingsBhatshala HouseKalindi ApartmentsChayanaut BhabanASA Head Office Building\n\nBashirul Haq (24 June 1942 \u2013 4 April 2020) was a Bangladeshi architect, planner and educator.
