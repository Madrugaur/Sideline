He is the Herbert H. Maass Professor in the school of mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.[2] His research interests include complexity theory, parallel algorithms, graph theory, cryptography, distributed computing, and neural networks.[3] Wigderson received the Abel Prize in 2021 for his work in theoretical computer science.[4]\n Avi Wigderson was born in Haifa, Israel to Holocaust survivors.[5] Wigderson is a graduate of the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa, and did his undergraduate studies at the Technion in Haifa, Israel, graduating in 1980, and went on to graduate study at Princeton University. He received his Ph.D. in computer science in 1983 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \"Studies in computational complexity\", under the supervision of Richard Lipton.[6][7] After short-term positions at the University of California, Berkeley, the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California, and the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, he joined the faculty of Hebrew University in 1986. In 1999 he also took a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, and in 2003 he gave up his Hebrew University position to take up full-time residence at the IAS.[3]\n Wigderson received the Nevanlinna Prize in 1994 for his work on computational complexity.[8] Along with Omer Reingold and Salil Vadhan he won the 2009 G\u00f6del Prize for work on the zig-zag product of graphs, a method of combining smaller graphs to produce larger ones used in the construction of expander graphs.[9] Wigderson was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011.[10] He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2013.[11]\nHe was elected as an ACM Fellow in 2018 for \"contributions to theoretical computer science and mathematics\".[12]\nIn 2019, Wigderson was awarded the Knuth Prize for his contributions to \"the foundations of computer science in areas including randomized computation, cryptography, circuit complexity, proof complexity, parallel computation, and our understanding of fundamental graph properties\".[13]\n In 2021 Wigderson shared the Abel Prize with L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz \u201cfor their foundational contributions to theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics, and their leading role in shaping them into central fields of modern mathematics.\"[14][15][16]\n ", "tags": ["1956 births", "Living people", "20th-century American scientists", "20th-century engineers", "21st-century American scientists", "21st-century engineers", "Abel Prize laureates", "American people of Israeli descent", "Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery", "G\u00f6del Prize laureates", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty", "Institute for Advanced Study faculty", "Israeli computer scientists", "Israeli mathematicians", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Nevanlinna Prize laureates", "Princeton University alumni", "Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology alumni", "Theoretical computer scientists", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from March 2021", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Israeli mathematician and computer scientist\n\n\nAvi WigdersonWigderson in 2012Born (1956-09-09) 9 September 1956 (age\u00a064)Haifa, IsraelEducationTechnionPrinceton University (Ph.D.)Known\u00a0forZig-zag productAwardsNevanlinna Prize (1994)G\u00f6del Prize (2009)Knuth Prize (2019)Abel Prize (2021)Scientific careerFieldsTheoretical computer scienceInstitutionsInstitute for Advanced StudyThesisStudies in Computational Complexity\u00a0(1983)Doctoral advisorRichard LiptonDoctoral studentsDorit AharonovRan Raz\n\nAvi Wigderson (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d2\u05d3\u05e8\u05d6\u05d5\u05df\u200e; born 9 September 1956[1]) is an Israeli mathematician and computer scientist.
