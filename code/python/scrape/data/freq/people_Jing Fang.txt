He was a Chinese music theorist, mathematician and astrologer.

This was known as the 'radiating influence' theory in ancient China, which stated that the light of the Moon was merely the light reflected from the Sun and that the celestial bodies were spherical. This accurate theory was dismissed by the philosopher Wang Chong (27\u201397 AD), yet embraced by the mathematician, inventor, and scientist Zhang Heng (78\u2013139 AD).\n Jing Fang stated:\n The moon and the planets are Yin; they have shape but no light.

(Alternatively, he would subtract \n\n\n\n1\n\n/\n\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1/3}\n\n from the interval, equivalent to a perfect fifth down, to keep all of the values greater than 177147, or less than 354294, it's double, effectively transposing them all into the range of a single octave.)\nProceed now from this new value to generate the next tone; repeat until all tones have been generated.\nTo produce an exact calculation, some 26 digits of accuracy would have been required.[5] Instead, by rounding to about 6 digits, his calculations are within 0.0145 cents of exactness, which is a difference much finer than is usually perceptible.
