{"name": "Felix Finster", "content": "Felix Finster (born 6 August 1967, in Mannheim) is a German mathematician working on problems in mathematical physics, geometry and analysis.\n Finster studied physics and mathematics at Heidelberg University, where he graduated in 1992 with Franz Wegner and Claus Gerhardt. In 1992\u20131995 he wrote his PhD thesis at ETH Z\u00fcrich with Konrad Osterwalder.[1] In 1996\u20131998 he was post-doc at Harvard University. From 1998\u20132002 he was member of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig. He got his habilitation in 2000 at Leipzig University. Since 2002 he is full professor of mathematics at the University of Regensburg.\n Finster works mainly on mathematical problems in general relativity and quantum theory. More specifically, in collaboration with Niky Kamran, Joel Smoller and Shing-Tung Yau he studies the dynamics of waves in a black hole geometry. Moreover, he developed the fermionic projector approach to quantum field theory. In this context, he formulated the causal action principle. In recent years, the approach was extended to so-called causal fermion systems, which form a mathematical framework for describing quantum geometries.\n ", "tags": ["20th-century German mathematicians", "21st-century mathematicians", "1967 births", "Living people", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Publons identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\n Felix Finster (2009)\nFelix Finster (born 6 August 1967, in Mannheim) is a German mathematician working on problems in mathematical physics, geometry and analysis.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and work\n2 Publications\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nLife and work[edit]\nFinster studied physics and mathematics at Heidelberg University, where he graduated in 1992 with Franz Wegner and Claus Gerhardt.
