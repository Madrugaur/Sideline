Dorrance, a chemist who had trained in Europe, was so determined to join Campbell that he agreed to pay for laboratory equipment out of his own pocket and accept a token salary of just $7.50 per week. In 1897, Dr John T Torrance discovered a method to create condensed soup.\n\n^ Cutter, William Richard (editor) (1919). American Biography: A New Cyclopedia, Volume 5.
