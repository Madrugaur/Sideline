{"name": "Shiu-Ying Hu", "content": "Shiu-Ying Hu, BBS (Chinese: \u80e1\u79c0\u82f1; 22 February 1910 \u2013 22 May 2012), or Hu Xiuying, was a Chinese botanist. She was an expert in the plant genera of Ilex (Aquifoliaceae), Hemerocallis (Amaryllidaceae), and Panax (Araliaceae). She studied the families Orchidaceae, Compositae, and Malvaceae, and Chinese medicinal herbs and food plants.[1] She was given the nickname \"Holly\u00a0Hu\" by her colleagues for her extensive work with holly plants.[2]\n Hu was born in 1910 to a farm family in a Chinese village near the city of Xuzhou in Jiangsu province. She received her B.Sc. in Biology from Ginling College (now part of Nanjing Normal University) and M.Sc. in Biology from Lingnan University (now part of Sun Yat-sen University). In 1946 Hu traveled to the United States to pursue a Ph.D. in Botany at Radcliffe College. Her supervisor was Elmer Drew Merrill. In 1949 she became the second Chinese woman to receive a doctoral degree in botany from Harvard University,[1][3][2] the first being Luetta Hsiu-Ying Chen (\u9648\u79c0\u82f1, 1910-1949), who received her Ph.D. degree in 1942.[4]\n After earning her Ph.D., Hu worked as a research botanist at the Arnold Arboretum. In 1968 she took the post of Senior Lecturer in the Department of Biology at CUHK, which Hu held until her retirement in 1975. She continued to carry out research during her retirement both at the CUHK Herbarium and the Harvard University Herbaria. Over the course of her career she produced over 160 academic treatises, collected over 30,000 specimens, and published the 800-page encyclopedia Food Plants of China.[1][5]\n On 22 May 2012, Hu died at the age of 102 from kidney failure caused by pneumonia at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin, Hong Kong.[2][5]\n John Williams attributes his piece Tree Song for Violin and Orchestra in a large part to Hu. The first movement of the piece is entitled \"Dr. Hu and the Meta-Sequoia\".[3] He described the following experience in his note for the premiere in 2000: During our stroll we casually paused in front of a large tree that I hadn't looked at closely enough to recognize immediately. Pointing to the tree, Dr. Hu explained that this tree was the oldest metasequoia in North America and that she had planted it in the late 1940s using seeds she had brought with her from China. I was thunderstruck by this coincidence, and when I told her of \u201cmy\u201d metasequoia in the Public Garden she informed me that the younger tree I loved so much was also one of her children.[6] ", "tags": ["1910 births", "2012 deaths", "Chinese botanists", "Chinese centenarians", "Hong Kong centenarians", "Sun Yat-sen University alumni", "Radcliffe College alumni", "Academics of Chinese University of Hong Kong", "Deaths from kidney failure", "Deaths from pneumonia", "Scientists from Xuzhou", "Recipients of the Bronze Bauhinia Star", "Harvard University faculty", "Biologists from Jiangsu", "Chinese women educators", "Educators from Xuzhou", "Republic of China people born during Qing", "Women centenarians", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Chinese-language text", "Botanists with author abbreviations", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Botanist identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Chinese botanist\nShiu-Ying HuBorn(1910-02-22)22 February 1910Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Qing EmpireDied22 May 2012(2012-05-22) (aged\u00a0102)Sha Tin, Hong KongAlma\u00a0materGinling College (BS)Lingnan University, Guangzhou (MS)Radcliffe College, Harvard (PhD)OccupationbotanistScientific careerInstitutionsWest China Union UniversityHarvard UniversityChung Chi College, CUHKDoctoral advisorElmer Drew MerrillInfluencesAlbert Steward\n\nShiu-Ying Hu, BBS (Chinese: \u80e1\u79c0\u82f1; 22 February 1910 \u2013 22 May 2012), or Hu Xiuying, was a Chinese botanist.
