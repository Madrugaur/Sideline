Thymaridas of Paros, an ancient Pythagorean already mentioned (p. 69), was the author of a rule for solving a certain set of n simultaneous simple equations connecting n unknown quantities. The rule was evidently well known, for it was called by the special name [...] the 'flower' or 'bloom' of Thymaridas. [...] The rule is very obscurely worded , but it states in effect that, if we have the following n equations connecting n unknown quantities x, x1, x2 ... xn\u22121, namely [...] Iamblichus, our informant on this subject, goes on to show that other types of equations can be reduced to this, so that the rule  does not 'leave us in the lurch' in those cases either.\n\n^ Flegg (1983). \"Unknown Numbers\". Numbers: Their History and Meaning. pp.\u00a0205. Thymaridas (fourth century) is said to have had this rule for solving a particular set of n linear equations in n unknowns:If the sum of n quantities be given, and also the sum of every pair containing a particular quantity, then this particular quantity is equal to 1/(n\u00a0+\u00a02) of the difference between the sums of these pairs and the first given sum.\n\n\nExternal
