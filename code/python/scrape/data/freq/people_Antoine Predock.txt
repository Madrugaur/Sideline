{"name": "Antoine Predock", "content": "Antoine Predock (/\u02c8pri\u02d0d\u0252k/ PREE-dok; born 1936 in Lebanon, Missouri) is an American architect based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He is the principal of Antoine Predock Architect PC, the studio he founded in 1967.\n Predock first gained national attention with the La Luz community in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The first national design competition he won was held by the Nelson Fine Arts Center at Arizona State University. Predock's work includes the Turtle Creek House, built in 1993 for bird enthusiasts along a prehistoric trail in Texas, the Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College, and a new ballpark for the San Diego Padres, the Petco Park. He has also worked on international sites such as the National Palace Museum Southern Branch in Southern Taiwan and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n Predock says his design has been highly influenced by his connection to New Mexico.[citation needed]\n Antoine Predock was born on June 24, 1936 in Lebanon, Missouri. He considers himself an Albuquerque native, though he did not move there until college.[1] Predock credits his mother, who had majored in liberal arts in college, for his artistic inclination, and his father, an engineer, for his technical interests.[2]\n Predock first attended the University of Missouri in Columbia School of Engineering,[3] then the University of New Mexico, where he studied engineering, emulating his father. Although he was a successful and academically inclined student, Predock found little fulfillment in his studies in engineering. Upon completing a technical drawing course taught by Don Schlegel, an architecture professor at UNM, Predock began to reevaluate his career choices. After a short hiatus from academic life, he returned to UNM at age 21 to study architecture. Schlegel acted as an advisor to Predock throughout the latter's time in the UNM architecture program. Eventually, Schlegel told Predock that he had taken advantage of all that UNM had to offer and encouraged him to apply elsewhere. Predock did, and was accepted to Columbia University, where he obtained his B.A. in architecture.[4]\n Predock established his first office in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1967. As of April 2019, Predock and his team have offices in Albuquerque and Taipei.[5]\n He and his firm have planned, developed, and collaborated on over 100 buildings and projects. They have been featured in over 60 exhibitions, 250 books, and over 1,000 publications.[6] He has also held various teaching positions at at least 14 universities, in the United States and elsewhere.[7]\n ", "tags": ["Modernist architects from the United States", "Postmodern architects", "Antoine Predock buildings", "1936 births", "Living people", "American designers", "American interior designers", "American landscape architects", "Architects from New Mexico", "Artists from Albuquerque, New Mexico", "National Design Award winners", "Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation alumni", "University of New Mexico alumni", "University of Missouri alumni", "People from Lebanon, Missouri", "20th-century American architects", "21st-century American architects", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from October 2016", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2008", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American architect\nAntoine PredockAntoine Predock in March 2005Born1936Lebanon, Missouri, United StatesAlma\u00a0materColumbia UniversityOccupationArchitectAwardsRome Prize (1985), AIA Gold Medal (2006), National Design Award (2007)BuildingsPetco ParkDesignAngular, brutalist-type building designs\nAntoine Predock (/\u02c8pri\u02d0d\u0252k/ PREE-dok; born 1936 in Lebanon, Missouri) is an American architect based in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
