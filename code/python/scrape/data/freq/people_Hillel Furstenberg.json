{"name": "Hillel Furstenberg", "content": "Hillel (Harry) Furstenberg (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05dc\u05dc (\u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9) \u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05e1\u05d8\u05e0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d2\u200e) (born September 29, 1935 in Berlin) is an American-Israeli mathematician and professor emeritus at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities and U.S. National Academy of Sciences and a laureate of the Abel Prize and the Wolf Prize in Mathematics. He is known for his application of probability theory and ergodic theory methods to other areas of mathematics, including number theory and Lie groups.\n Furstenberg was born in Germany, in 1935 (originally named \"F\u00fcrstenberg\"). In 1939, Shortly after Kristallnacht, his family escaped to the United States and settled in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War.[1] He attended Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy and then Yeshiva University, where he concluded his BA and MSc studies at the age of 20 in 1955. Furstenberg published several papers as an undergraduate, including  \"Note on one type of indeterminate form\" (1953) and \"On the infinitude of primes\" (1955).  Both appeared in the \"American Mathematical Monthly, the latter provided a topological proof of Euclid's famous theorem that there are infinitely many primes.\n Furstenberg pursued his doctorate at Princeton University under the supervision of Salomon Bochner.  In 1958 he received his PhD for his thesis, Prediction Theory.[2]\n From 1959\u20131960, Furstenberg served as the C. L. E. Moore instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[3]\n Furstenberg got his first job as an assistant professor in 1961 at the University of Minnesota. Furstenberg was promoted to full professor at Minnesota but moved to Israel in 1965 to join at Hebrew University's Einstein Institute of Mathematics. He retired from Hebrew University in 2003.[4] Furstenberg serves as an Advisory Committee member of The Center for Advanced Studies in Mathematics at Ben Gurion University of the Negev.[2]\n In 2003, Hebrew University and Ben-Gurion University held a joint conference to celebrate Furstenberg's retirement. The four-day Conference on Probability in Mathematics was subtitled Furstenfest 2003 and included four days of lectures.[5]\n In 1993, Furstenberg won the Israel Prize and in 2007, the Wolf Prize in mathematics. He is a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (elected 1974),[6] the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (international honorary member since 1995),[7] and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (elected 1989).[8]\n Fustenberg has taught generations of students, including Alexander Lubotzky, Yuval Peres, Tamar Ziegler, Shahar Mozes, and Vitaly Bergelson.[9]\n Furstenberg gained attention at an early stage in his career for producing an innovative topological proof of the infinitude of prime numbers in 1955.\n In a series of articles beginning in 1963 with A Poisson Formula for Semi-Simple Lie Groups, he continued to establish himself as a ground-breaking thinker.  His work showing that the behavior of random walks on a group is intricately related to the structure of the group - which led to what is now called the Furstenberg boundary \u2013 has been hugely influential in the study of lattices and Lie groups.[4]\n In his 1967 paper, Disjointness in ergodic theory, minimal sets, and a problem in Diophantine approximation, Furstenberg introduced the notion of \u2018disjointness,\u2019 a notion in ergodic systems that is analogous to coprimality for integers. The notion turned out to have applications in areas such as number theory, fractals, signal processing and electrical engineering.\n In his 1977 paper, Ergodic behavior of diagonal measures and a theorem of Szemer\u00e9di on arithmetic progressions, Furstenberg used methods from ergodic theory to prove a celebrated result by Endre Szemer\u00e9di, which states that any subset of integers with positive upper density contains arbitrarily large arithmetic progressions. His insights led to important results, such as the proof by Ben Green and Terence Tao that the sequence of prime numbers includes arbitrary large arithmetic progressions.\n He proved unique ergodicity of horocycle flows on compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces in the early 1970s. In 1977, he gave an ergodic theory reformulation, and subsequently proof, of Szemer\u00e9di's theorem. The Furstenberg boundary and Furstenberg compactification of a locally symmetric space are named after him, as is the Furstenberg\u2013S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy theorem in additive number theory.\n In 1958, Furstenberg married Rochelle (n\u00e9e) Cohen, a journalist and literary critic. Together they have five children and sixteen grandchildren.[4]\n ", "tags": ["1935 births", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "People from Washington Heights, Manhattan", "Living people", "Abel Prize laureates", "Israel Prize in exact science recipients", "Israel Prize in exact science recipients who were mathematicians", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty", "Members of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "Israeli mathematicians", "Princeton University alumni", "University of Minnesota faculty", "Wolf Prize in Mathematics laureates", "Yeshiva University alumni", "German Jews", "American people of German-Jewish descent", "Israeli Jews", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 maint: uses authors parameter", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American-Israeli mathematician\nHarry FurstenbergBorn (1935-09-29) September 29, 1935 (age\u00a085)Berlin, GermanyNationalityIsraelAmericanEducationYeshiva University (BA, MS)Princeton University (PhD)Known\u00a0forProof of Szemer\u00e9di's theoremIP setEvenly spaced integer topologyFurstenberg\u2013S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy theoremFurstenberg boundaryFurstenberg's proofAwardsAbel PrizeIsrael PrizeHarvey PrizeWolf PrizeScientific careerFieldsMathematicsDoctoral advisorSalomon BochnerDoctoral studentsAlexander LubotzkyVitaly BergelsonShahar MozesYuval PeresTamar Ziegler\n\nHillel (Harry) Furstenberg (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05dc\u05dc (\u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9) \u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05e1\u05d8\u05e0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d2\u200e) (born September 29, 1935 in Berlin) is an American-Israeli mathematician and professor emeritus at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
