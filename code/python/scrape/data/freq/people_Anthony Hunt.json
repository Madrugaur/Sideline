{"name": "Anthony Hunt", "content": "\n Anthony Hunt (born 1932) is a structural engineer of numerous world-renowned buildings, with a career spanning from the 1950s until his retirement in 2002. With a strong interest in both engineering and industrial design, Hunt was a major player in creating the High Tech movement of Norman Foster and Richard Rogers. He formed Anthony Hunt Associates in 1962. He worked with Rogers and Foster on Reliance Controls building in Swindon (1966) which was the first building of the High Tech architecture style.[1] He was also a structural engineer on the Waterloo International railway station in London (1993).\n Anthony Hunt was the eldest child of a solicitor's clerk in Streatham Hill in London. He moved away from London with his mother and brother in order to avoid the Blitz, and finally settled in Farnborough, Hampshire. After leaving Salesian College at 16 he attended Northampton Polytechnic 1947 - 1948, but didn't complete the course. He then attended Westminster Technical College in London and studied civil engineering on a day release course. He first worked for Wheeler & Jupp, a small civil engineering firm in London, and later obtained a professional qualification in structural engineering.\n Hunt was impressed by the Festival of Britain's Skylon, engineered by Frank Newby and Felix Samuely of FJ Samuely & Partners, two of the most influential engineers at the time. This inspired him to seek employment with the firm, which he achieved. It was with FJ Samuely & Partners that Hunt really developed his passion for structural engineering, working on projects such as Eero Saarinen's American Embassy in London.\n Following a spell working for Terence Conran and for Hancock Associates, Hunt founded Anthony Hunt Associates in 1962. He worked extensively with a new generation of British Architects, including Norman Foster, Richard Rogers, Michael Hopkins and Nicholas Grimshaw and played a large role in developing the lightweight, component-based style of British architecture known as High Tech. Throughout his career, Hunt maintained a keen interest in the wider aspects of industrial design.\n [2][3]\n ", "tags": ["British structural engineers", "1932 births", "Living people", "Engineers from London", "Use dmy dates from April 2018", "Use British English from April 2018", "BLP articles lacking sources from April 2009", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThis biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.
