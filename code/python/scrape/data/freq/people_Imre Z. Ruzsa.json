Ruzsa (born 23 July 1953) is a Hungarian mathematician specializing in number theory.\n Ruzsa participated in the International Mathematical Olympiad for Hungary, winning a silver medal in 1969, and two consecutive gold medals with perfect scores in 1970 and 1971. He graduated from the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in 1976. Since then he has been at the Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Rollo Davidson Prize in 1988. He was elected corresponding member (1998) and member (2004) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He was invited speaker at the European Congress of Mathematics at Stockholm, 2004, and in the Combinatorics section of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, 2006. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[1]\n With Endre Szemer\u00e9di he proved subquadratic upper and lower bounds for the Ruzsa\u2013Szemer\u00e9di problem on the number of triples of points in which the union of any three triples contains at least seven points.  He proved that  an essential component has at least (log\u00a0x)1+\u03b5 elements up to x, for some \u03b5\u00a0>\u00a00. On the other hand, for every \u03b5\u00a0>\u00a00 there is an essential component that has at most (log\u00a0x)1+\u03b5 elements up to x, for every x. He gave a new proof to Freiman's theorem.
