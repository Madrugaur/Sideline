{"name": "Jagadish Chandra Bose", "content": "\n Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose[1] CSI CIE FRS[2][3][4]\n(/bo\u028as/;,[5] IPA:\u00a0[d\u0292\u0254\u0261odi\u0283 t\u0283\u0254ndro bosu]; 30 November 1858 \u2013 23 November 1937[6]) was a biologist, physicist, botanist and an early writer of science fiction.[7] He pioneered the investigation of radio and microwave optics, made significant contributions to plant science, and laid the foundations of experimental science in the Indian subcontinent.[8] IEEE named him one of the fathers of radio science.[9] Bose is considered the father of Bengali science fiction, and also invented the crescograph, a device for measuring the growth of plants. A crater on the moon has been named in his honour.[10] He founded Bose Institute, a premier research institute of India and also one of its oldest. Established in 1917, the Institute was the first  interdisciplinary research centre in Asia.[11] He served as the Director of Bose Institute from its inception until his death.\n Born in Munshiganj, Bengal Presidency, during British governance of India (now in Bangladesh),[6] Bose graduated from St. Xavier's College, Calcutta (now Kolkata, West Bengal, India). He went to the University of London, England to study medicine, but could not pursue studies in medicine because of health problems. Instead, he conducted his research with the Nobel Laureate Lord Rayleigh at Cambridge and returned to India. He joined the Presidency College of the University of Calcutta as a professor of physics. There, despite racial discrimination and a lack of funding and equipment, Bose carried on his scientific research. He made remarkable progress in his research of remote wireless signalling and was the first to use semiconductor junctions to detect radio signals. However, instead of trying to gain commercial benefit from this invention, Bose made his inventions public in order to allow others to further develop his research.\n Bose subsequently made a number of pioneering discoveries in plant physiology. He used his own invention, the crescograph, to measure plant response to various stimuli, and thereby scientifically proved parallelism between animal and plant tissues. Although Bose filed for a patent for one of his inventions because of peer pressure, his objection to any form of patenting was well known. To facilitate his research, he constructed automatic recorders capable of registering extremely slight movements; these instruments produced some striking results, such as quivering of injured plants, which Bose interpreted as a power of feeling in plants. His books include Response in the Living and Non-Living (1902) and The Nervous Mechanism of Plants (1926). In a 2004 BBC poll, Bose was voted seventh Greatest Bengali of all time.[12]\n Jagadish Chandra Bose was born in a Bengali Kayastha family in Munsiganj (Bikrampur), Bengal Presidency (present-day Bangladesh)[6][13] on 30 November 1858, to Bama Sundari Bose and Bhagawan Chandra Bose. His father was a leading member of the Brahmo Samaj and worked as a deputy magistrate and assistant commissioner in Faridpur,[14] Bardhaman and other places.[15]\n Bose's education started in a vernacular school, because his father believed that one must know one's own mother tongue before beginning English, and that one should know also one's own people. Speaking at the Bikrampur Conference in 1915, Bose said:\n At that time, sending children to English schools was an aristocratic status symbol. In the vernacular school, to which I was sent, the son of the Muslim attendant of my father sat on my right side, and the son of a fisherman sat on my left. They were my playmates. I listened spellbound to their stories of birds, animals, and aquatic creatures. Perhaps these stories created in my mind a keen interest in investigating the workings of Nature. When I returned home from school accompanied by my school fellows, my mother welcomed and fed all of us without discrimination. Although she was an orthodox old-fashioned lady. It was because of my childhood friendship with them. I never realised that there existed a 'problem' common to the two communities, Hindus and Muslims.[15] Bose joined the Hare School in 1869 and then St. Xavier's School at Kolkata. In 1875, he passed the Entrance Examination (equivalent to school graduation) of the University of Calcutta and was admitted to St. Xavier's College, Calcutta. At St. Xavier's, Bose came in contact with Jesuit Father Eugene Lafont, who played a significant role in developing his interest in natural sciences.[15][16] He received a BA from the University of Calcutta in 1879.[14]\n Bose wanted to go to England to compete for the Indian Civil Service. However, his father, a civil servant himself, cancelled the plan. He wished his son to be a scholar, who would \u201crule nobody but himself.\u201d[17] Bose went to England to study Medicine at the University of London. However, he had to quit because of ill health.[18][self-published source] The odour in the dissection rooms is also said to have exacerbated his illness.[14]\n Through the recommendation of Anandamohan Bose, his brother-in-law (sister's husband) and the first Indian Wrangler, he secured admission in Christ's College, Cambridge to study natural sciences. He received a BA (Natural Sciences Tripos) from the University of Cambridge[16] and a BSc from the University College London affiliated under University of London in 1884,[19] and a DSc from the University College London, University of London in 1896.[16] Among Bose's teachers at Cambridge were Lord Rayleigh, Michael Foster, James Dewar, Francis Darwin, Francis Balfour, and Sidney Vines. At the time when Bose was a student at Cambridge, Prafulla Chandra Roy was a student at Edinburgh. They met in London and became intimate friends.[14][15] Later he was married to Abala Bose, the renowned feminist and social worker.[20]\n One of the important influences on Bose was Sister Nivedita who supported him by organizing financial support and editing his manuscripts; she made sure that Bose was able to continue with and share his work.[21]\n The Scottish theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell mathematically predicted the existence of electromagnetic radiation of diverse wavelengths, but he died in 1879 before his prediction was experimentally verified. Between 1886 and 1888, German physicist Heinrich Hertz published the results of his experiments on electromagnetism, which showed the existence of electromagnetic waves in free space. Subsequently, British physicist Oliver Lodge, who had also been researching electromagnetism, conducted a commemorative lecture in August 1894 (after Hertz's death) on the quasi-optical nature of \"Hertzian waves\" (radio waves) and demonstrated their similarity to light and vision including reflection and transmission at distances up to 50 metres. Lodge's work was published in book form and caught the attention of scientists in different countries, including Bose in India.[22]\n The first remarkable aspect of Bose's follow-up microwave research was that he reduced the waves to the millimetre level (about 5\u00a0mm wavelength). He realised the disadvantages of long waves for studying their light-like properties.[22]\n During a November 1894 (or 1895[22]) public demonstration at Town Hall of Kolkata, Bose ignited gunpowder and rang a bell at a distance using millimetre range wavelength microwaves.[23] Lieutenant Governor Sir William Mackenzie witnessed Bose's demonstration in the Kolkata Town Hall. Bose wrote in a Bengali essay,  Adrisya Alok (Invisible Light), \"The invisible light can easily pass through brick walls, buildings etc. Therefore, messages can be transmitted by means of it without the mediation of wires.\"[22]\n Bose's first scientific paper, \"On polarisation of electric rays by double-refracting crystals\" was communicated to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in May 1895, within a year of Lodge's paper. His second paper was communicated to the Royal Society of London by Lord Rayleigh in October 1895. In December 1895, the London journal Electrician (Vol. 36) published Bose's paper, \"On a new electro-polariscope\". At that time, the word coherer, coined by Lodge, was used in the English-speaking world for Hertzian wave receivers or detectors. The Electrician readily commented on Bose's coherer. (December 1895). The Englishman (18 January 1896) quoted from the Electrician and commented as follows:\n Should Professor Bose succeed in perfecting and patenting his \u2018Coherer\u2019, we may in time see the whole system of coast lighting throughout the navigable world revolutionised by a Bengali scientist working single handed in our Presidency College Laboratory. Bose planned to \"perfect his coherer\" but never thought of patenting it.[22]\n Bose went to London on a lecture tour in 1896 and met Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi, who had been developing a radio wave wireless telegraphy system for over a year and was trying to market it to the British post service. In an interview, Bose expressed his disinterest in commercial telegraphy and suggested others use his research work. In 1899, Bose announced the development of a \"iron-mercury-iron coherer with telephone detector\" in a paper presented at the Royal Society, London.[24]\n Bose's work in radio microwave optics was specifically directed towards studying the nature of the phenomenon and was not an attempt to develop radio into a communication medium.[25] His experiments took place during this same period (from late 1894 on) when Guglielmo Marconi was making breakthroughs on a radio system specifically designed for wireless telegraphy[26] and others were finding practical applications for radio waves, such as Russian physicist Alexander Stepanovich Popov radio wave based lightning detector, also inspired by Lodge's experiment.[27] Although Bose's work was not related to communication he, like Lodge and other laboratory experimenters, probably had an influence on other inventors trying to develop radio as communications medium.[27][28][29] Bose was not interested in patenting his work and openly revealed the operation of his galena crystal detector in his lectures. A friend in the US persuaded him to take out a US patent on his detector but he did not actively pursue it and allowed it to lapse.\"[14]\n Bose was the first to use a semiconductor junction to detect radio waves, and he invented various now-commonplace microwave components.[27] In 1954, Pearson and Brattain gave priority to Bose for the use of a semi-conducting crystal as a detector of radio waves.[27] In fact, further work at millimetre wavelengths was almost non-existent for the following 50 years. In 1897, Bose described to the Royal Institution in London his research carried out in Kolkata at millimetre wavelengths. He used waveguides, horn antennas, dielectric lenses, various polarisers and even semiconductors at frequencies as high as 60\u00a0GHz;.[27] Much of his original equipment is still in existence, especially at the Bose Institute in Kolkata. A 1.3\u00a0mm multi-beam receiver now in use on the NRAO 12\u00a0 Metre Telescope, Arizona, US, incorporates concepts from his original 1897 papers.[27]\n Sir Nevill Mott, Nobel Laureate in 1977 for his own contributions to solid-state electronics, remarked that \"J.C. Bose was at least 60\u00a0years ahead of his time. In fact, he had anticipated the existence of P-type and N-type semiconductors.\"[27]\n Bose conducted most of his studies in plant research on Mimosa pudica and Desmodium gyrans plants. His major contribution in the field of biophysics was the demonstration of the electrical nature of the conduction of various stimuli (e.g., wounds, chemical agents) in plants, which were earlier thought to be of a chemical nature. In order to understand the heliotropic movements of plants (the movement of a plant towards a light source), Bose invented a torsional recorder. He found that light applied to one side of the sunflower caused turbot to increase on the opposite side. These claims were later proven experimentally.[30] He was also the first to study the action of microwaves in plant tissues and corresponding changes in the cell membrane potential. He researched the mechanism of the seasonal effect on plants, the effect of chemical inhibitors on plant stimuli and the effect of temperature.\n Bose performed a comparative study of the fatigue response of various metals and organic tissue in plants. He subjected metals to a combination of mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electrical stimuli and noted the similarities between metals and cells. Bose's experiments demonstrated a cyclical fatigue response in both stimulated cells and metals, as well as a distinctive cyclical fatigue and recovery response across multiple types of stimuli in both living cells and metals.\n Bose documented a characteristic electrical response curve of plant cells to electrical stimulus, as well as the decrease and eventual absence of this response in plants treated with anaesthetics or poison. The response was also absent in zinc treated with oxalic acid. He noted a similarity in reduction of elasticity between cooled metal wires and organic cells, as well as an impact on the recovery cycle period of the metal.[31][32]\n In 1896, Bose wrote Niruddesher Kahini (The Story of the Missing One), a short story that was later expanded and added to Abyakta (\u0985\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u0995\u09cd\u09a4) collection in 1921 with the new title Palatak Tuphan (Runaway Cyclone). It was one of the first works of Bengali science fiction.[33][34] It has been translated into English by Bodhisattva Chattopadhyay.[35]\n In 1917 Bose established the Bose Institute in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. Bose was its Director for the first twenty years till his demise. Today it is a public research institute of India and also one of its oldest. Bose in his inaugural address on 30 November 1917 dedicated the Institute to the nation saying:\n I dedicate today this Institute\u2014not merely a Laboratory but a Temple. The power of physical methods applies to the establishment of that truth which can be realised directly through our senses, or through the vast expansion of the perceptive range by means of artificially created organs...  Thirty-two years ago I chose the teaching of science as my vocation. It was held that by its very peculiar constitution, the Indian mind would always turn away from the study of Nature to metaphysical speculations. Even had the capacity for inquiry and accurate observation been assumed to be present, there were no opportunities for their employment; there were neither well-equipped laboratories nor skilled mechanicians. This was all too true. It is not for man to complain of circumstances, but bravely to accept, to confront and to dominate them; and we belong to that race which has accomplished great things with simple means.....[36][37] Bose's place in history has now been re-evaluated. His work may have contributed to the development of radio communication.[24] He is also credited with discovering millimetre length electromagnetic waves and being a pioneer in the field of biophysics.[39]\n Many of his instruments are still on display and remain largely usable now, over 100 years later. They include various antennas, polarisers, and waveguides, which remain in use in modern forms today.\n To commemorate his birth centenary in 1958, the JBNSTS scholarship programme was started in West Bengal. In the same year, India issued a postage stamp bearing his portrait.[40] The same year Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose, a documentary film directed by Pijush Bose, was released. It was produced by the Government of India's Films Division.[41][42] Films Division also produced another documentary film, again titled Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose, this time directed by the prominent Indian filmmaker Tapan Sinha.[43]\n On 14 September 2012, Bose's experimental work in millimetre-band radio was recognised as an IEEE Milestone in Electrical and Computer Engineering, the first such recognition of a discovery in India.[44]\n On 30 November 2016, Bose was celebrated in a Google Doodle on the 158th anniversary of his birth.[45]\n The Bank of England has decided to redesign the 50 UK Pound currency note with an eminent scientist. Indian scientist Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose has been featured in that nomination list for his pioneering work on Wifi technology.[46][47][48]\n ", "tags": ["1858 births", "1937 deaths", "Alumni of Christ's College, Cambridge", "Alumni of the University of London", "Alumni of University College London", "Bengali people", "Bengali chemists", "Bengali physicists", "Bengali scientists", "19th-century Indian physicists", "20th-century Indian physicists", "Brahmos", "Das family of Telirbagh", "Hare School alumni", "Presidency University, Kolkata faculty", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy", "Knights Bachelor", "Companions of the Order of the Indian Empire", "Companions of the Order of the Star of India", "Indian knights", "People from Mymensingh District", "St. Xavier's College, Kolkata alumni", "University of Calcutta alumni", "University of Calcutta faculty", "Bengali-language science fiction writers", "People from Bikrampur", "Scientists from Kolkata", "History of radio", "Radio pioneers", "People from Munshiganj District", "Bengali Hindus", "Articles with Bengali-language sources (bn)", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use Indian English from January 2020", "All Wikipedia articles written in Indian English", "Use dmy dates from November 2020", "Biography with signature", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Scientist\n\n\nAcharya, SirJagadish Chandra BoseKt,\nCSI, CIE, FRSJagadish Chandra Bose in Royal Institution, London, 1897Born(1858-11-30)30 November 1858Bikrampur, Bengal Presidency, British India (now Munshiganj, Bangladesh)Died23 November 1937(1937-11-23) (aged\u00a078)Giridih, Bengal Presidency, British India (now Giridih, Jharkhand, India)Alma\u00a0materSt. Xavier's College, Calcutta (BA)Christ's College, Cambridge (BA)University College London (BSc, DSc)Known\u00a0forMillimetre wavesRadioCrescographContributions to plant biologyCrystal radioCrystal detectorSpouse(s)Abala BoseAwardsCompanion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) (1903)Companion of the Order of the Star of India (CSI) (1911)Knight Bachelor (1917)Scientific careerFieldsPhysics, biophysics, biology, botanyInstitutionsUniversity of CalcuttaUniversity of CambridgeUniversity of LondonAcademic advisorsJohn Strutt (Rayleigh)Notable studentsSatyendra Nath BoseMeghnad SahaPrasanta Chandra MahalanobisSisir Kumar MitraDebendra Mohan Bose\nSignature\nSir Jagadish Chandra Bose[1] CSI CIE FRS[2][3][4]\n(/bo\u028as/;,[5] IPA:\u00a0[d\u0292\u0254\u0261odi\u0283 t\u0283\u0254ndro bosu]; 30 November 1858 \u2013 23 November 1937[6]) was a biologist, physicist, botanist and an early writer of science fiction.[7] He pioneered the investigation of radio and microwave optics, made significant contributions to plant science, and laid the foundations of experimental science in the Indian subcontinent.[8] IEEE named him one of the fathers of radio science.[9] Bose is considered the father of Bengali science fiction, and also invented the crescograph, a device for measuring the growth of plants.

The power of physical methods applies to the establishment of that truth which can be realised directly through our senses, or through the vast expansion of the perceptive range by means of artificially created organs...  Thirty-two years ago I chose the teaching of science as my vocation. It was held that by its very peculiar constitution, the Indian mind would always turn away from the study of Nature to metaphysical speculations. Even had the capacity for inquiry and accurate observation been assumed to be present, there were no opportunities for their employment; there were neither well-equipped laboratories nor skilled mechanicians. This was all too true. It is not for man to complain of circumstances, but bravely to accept, to confront and to dominate them; and we belong to that race which has accomplished great things with simple means.....[36][37]\nLegacy and honors[edit]\n Acharya Bhavan, the residence of J C Bose built in 1902, was turned into a museum.[38]\nBose's place in history has now been re-evaluated. His work may have contributed to the development of radio communication.[24] He is also credited with discovering millimetre length electromagnetic waves and being a pioneer in the field of biophysics.[39]\nMany of his instruments are still on display and remain largely usable now, over 100 years later. They include various antennas, polarisers, and waveguides, which remain in use in modern forms today.\nTo commemorate his birth centenary in 1958, the JBNSTS scholarship programme was started in West Bengal. In the same year, India issued a postage stamp bearing his portrait.[40] The same year Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose, a documentary film directed by Pijush Bose, was released. It was produced by the Government of India's Films Division.[41][42] Films Division also produced another documentary film, again titled Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose, this time directed by the prominent Indian filmmaker Tapan Sinha.[43]\nOn 14 September 2012, Bose's experimental work in millimetre-band radio was recognised as an IEEE Milestone in Electrical and Computer Engineering, the first such recognition of a discovery in India.[44]\nOn 30 November 2016, Bose was celebrated in a Google Doodle on the 158th anniversary of his birth.[45]\nThe Bank of England has decided to redesign the 50 UK Pound currency note with an eminent scientist. Indian scientist Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose has been featured in that nomination list for his pioneering work on Wifi technology.[46][47][48]\n\nThe J.C. Bose University of Science and Technology, YMCA, named in his honour.\nCompanion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE, 1903)\nCompanion of the Order of the Star of India (CSI, 1912)\nKnight Bachelor (1917)\nFellow of the Royal Society (FRS, 1920)[4]\nMember of the Vienna Academy of Sciences, 1928\nPresident of the 14th session of the Indian Science Congress in 1927.[49]\nMember of Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters in 1929.\nMember of the League of Nations' Committee for Intellectual Cooperation (from 1924 to 1931)[50]\nFounding fellow of the National Institute of Sciences of India (now the Indian National Science Academy)\nThe Indian Botanic Garden was renamed in his honour as the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden on 25 June 2009.[51]\nIn 2004, Bose was ranked number 7 in BBC's poll of the Greatest Bengali of all time.[12]\nPublications[edit]\n Bust of Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose which is placed in the garden of Birla Industrial & Technological Museum\nJournals\nNature published about 27 papers.\nBose J.C.
