{"name": "John Gwynn (architect)", "content": "\n John Gwynn RA (1713 \u2013 28 February 1786) was an English architect and civil engineer, who became one of the founder members of the Royal Academy in 1768. He advocated greater control over planning in London,  for which he produced detailed suggestions. His buildings include Magdalen Bridge and the Covered Market in Oxford, and several bridges over the River Severn.\n Gwynn was born and died in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. He worked initially as a carpenter, but then decided to practice as a (largely self-taught) architect and town planner,  moving to London, where he  became a friend of Samuel Johnson.[1]\n \nIn 1749, when Sir Christopher Wren's drawings were sold, Gwynn obtained Wren's  plan for the rebuilding of   the City of London, and published it,  adding some  comments of his own.[2] Seventeen years later, in 1766, he published London and Westminster Improved, in which he criticised the loose control over building in the West End, saying that  \"the finest part of town is left to ignorant and capricious persons\", and called for development to be controlled by a general plan.[2] He made more than a hundred suggestions for improvements to the capital.[3] They included the rebuilding of London Bridge;[4] the construction of a \"St, George's Bridge\"  in the position where Waterloo Bridge was eventually built;   a \"King's Square\" on the site of  the Royal Mews [5] (later occupied by Trafalgar Square); a royal palace in Hyde Park; a street following a route close to that of Nash's later Regent Street and quays along both sides of the Thames.[5] The Quarterly Review noted in 1826 that   No part of his ingenious design, however, was adopted: the publication does not appear to have produced any public interest at the time; and Mr. Gwynn has been so little thought of since that his designs lately brought forward as original conceptions.[5]  However proposals similar to many of Gwynn's were eventually implemented;[3] in the twentieth century, John Summerson wrote that \"the amazing thing about this plan is its complete grip on reality\", his only impractical belief being that the growth of London could be stopped at  Hyde Park in the west  and at the Marylebone Road in the north.[3]\n Gwynn was a key figure in the introduction of the Building Act 1774 [1] which improved standards of materials and workmanship \u2013  Bedford Square was one of the first areas of London to benefit.[citation needed]\n In 1759, he unsuccessfully submitted a design to the competition for the new  Blackfriars Bridge.[citation needed] Samuel Johnson lobbied on his behalf, sending three letters in his support to the Daily Gazetteer,[6] but plans by Robert Mylne were preferred.[1]  He was particularly associated with projects in Oxford, including Magdalen Bridge (1772\u201390), the city's workhouse (1772\u201373) and the Covered Market (1774), and with bridges across the River Severn[1] including  the \"English Bridge\", in his native Shrewsbury  (1769),[7] and others at Atcham (1769\u201371)[8], Worcester (1781)[9] and Llandrinio (1769-1775).[10]\n He was one of the foundation members of the Royal Academy in 1768,[11] Samuel Wale, the academy's first professor of perspective had at one time been his assistant.[12]\n An  anonymous publication of 1742 entitled  The Art of Architecture: A Poem  In Imitation of Horace's Art of Poetry has been generally attributed to Gwynn.[6]\n He died in Shrewsbury in 1786.\n ", "tags": ["1713 births", "1786 deaths", "People from Shrewsbury", "British bridge engineers", "18th-century English architects", "Royal Academicians", "English civil engineers", "Architects from Shropshire", "Use dmy dates from April 2018", "Use British English from April 2018", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from August 2012", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\n John Gwynn\nJohn Gwynn RA (1713 \u2013 28 February 1786) was an English architect and civil engineer, who became one of the founder members of the Royal Academy in 1768.
