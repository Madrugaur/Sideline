Glushkov graduated from Rostov State University in 1948, and in 1952 proposed solutions to Hilbert's fifth problem and defended his thesis in Moscow State University.\n In 1956 he began working with computers and worked in Kyiv as a Director of the Computational Center of the Academy of Science of Ukraine. In 1958 he became a member of the Communist Party. In 1962 Glushkov established the famous Institute of Cybernetics of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine and became its first Director. \n He made contributions to the theory of automata. He and his followers (Kapitonova, Letichevskiy and other) successfully applied that theory to enhance construction of computers. His book on that topic \"Synthesis of Digital Automata\" became well known. For that work, he was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1964 and elected as a Member of the Academy of Science of USSR.\n He greatly influenced many other fields of theoretical computer science (including the theory of programming and artificial intelligence) as well as its applications in the USSR. He published nearly 800 printed works.\n One of his great practical goals was the creation of the National Automated System for Computation and Information Processing (OGAS), consisting of a computer network to manage the allocation of resources and information among organizations in the national economy, which would represent a higher form of socialist planning than the extant centrally planned economy. This ambitious project was ahead of its time, first being proposed and modeled in 1962. It received opposition from many senior Communist Party leaders who felt the system threatened Party control of the economy.[2] By the early 1970s official interest in this system ended.\n Glushkov founded a Kyiv-based Chair of Theoretical Cybernetics and Methods of Optimal Control at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology in 1967[3] and a Chair of Theoretical Cybernetics at Kyiv State University in 1969.[4]\nThe Institute of Cybernetics of National Academy of Science of Ukraine, which he created, is named after him.\n ", "tags": ["1923 births", "1982 deaths", "Russian scientists", "Soviet computer scientists", "Russian mathematicians", "Soviet mathematicians", "Russian inventors", "Cyberneticists", "Heroes of Socialist Labour", "Recipients of the Order of Lenin", "Recipients of the USSR State Prize", "Lenin Prize winners", "Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Members of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine", "Foreign Members of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences", "Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology faculty", "Information technology in Ukraine", "Members of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina", "Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 Russian-language sources (ru)", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Victor GlushkovPostal stationery of the Soviet Union on the occasion of the 1st anniversary of Glushkov's death.Born(1923-08-24)August 24, 1923Rostov-on-Don, Russian SFSR, USSRDiedJanuary 30, 1982(1982-01-30) (aged\u00a058)Moscow, Russian SFSR, USSRAlma\u00a0materRostov State UniversityKnown\u00a0forPioneer of Soviet ComputingGlushkov's construction algorithmAwardsLenin Prize, USSR State Prizes,\nIEEE Computer Pioneer AwardScientific careerFieldsCybernetics, control theoryInstitutionsInstitute of Cybernetics, KyivThesisLocally Nilpotent Torsion-Free Groups with the Conditions of Breakage for Some Chains of Subgroups\u00a0(1951)Doctoral advisorSergei Chernikov\n\nVictor Mikhailovich Glushkov (Russian: \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0301\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0301\u0432; August 24, 1923 \u2013 January 30, 1982) was a Russian mathematician,[1] the founding father of information technology in the Soviet Union and one of the founding fathers of Soviet cybernetics.\nHe was born in Rostov-on-Don, Russian SFSR, in the family of a mining engineer.
