B\u00e9lidor enlisted in the army at a young age. After leaving the army, he developed an interest in science and engineering, and became professor of artillery at the school of F\u00e8re-en-Tardenois in Aisne. For a while he worked on measuring the arc of the earth.[1] In the years to come he published several works of great importance, on a wide range of subjects, including hydraulics, mathematics, and civil and military engineering. His most famous book is L'architecture hydraulique (published in four volumes from 1737-1753). Here, integral calculus is used for the first time in solving technical problems.[1]\n B\u00e9lidor was the teacher of Peter the Great\u2019s Ethiopian favourite, Abram Petrovich Gannibal.
