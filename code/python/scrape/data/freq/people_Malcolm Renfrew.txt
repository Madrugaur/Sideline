Well known for his research, Renfrew was praised for his work on chemical safety and as an educator, both recognized in the ACS 1985 Chemical Health and Safety Award for \"his publications and column on Chemical Safety in the Journal of Chemical Education\".  In 2006 he received the Distinguished Science Communicator award.[24]\n Renfrew was also an artist: an exhibition of his paintings was held in Moscow City Hall in November\u2013December 2010.[25] His 100th birthday, October 12, 2010, was declared as \"Malcolm M. Renfrew Day\" in the State of Idaho by Governor Butch Otter.[26] Part of the celebration was the rededication of  Renfrew Hall, the chemistry building named for him a quarter century earlier. Opened 57\u00a0years ago in 1964 as the Physical Sciences Building (\"Phy-Sci\"),[27] it was renamed \"Renfrew Hall\" in October 1985 for his 75th birthday.[28]\n Shortly after gaining his doctorate, he married Carol Joy Campbell (September 19, 1913 \u2013 January 12, 2010), on June 26, 1938.  A member of Kappa Alpha Theta, she was a 1935 B.S. economics graduate of the University of Idaho from Rosalia, Washington. Born on a farm near Fairfield,[29] at the time of her death at age 96, they had been married for over 71 years.[24][30][31][32]\n Renfrew was an Elder of the Presbyterian Church, a gifted watercolorist, and played the trombone.[1][33] He was a member of the Idaho Vandals Non-Marching Pep Band[34] and the \"Hog Heaven Big Band.\"[35] (\"Hog Heaven\" was an early name for Moscow, due to plentiful camas roots.)[36][37][38]\n Renfrew died at his residence in Moscow at Good Samaritan Village on October 12, 2013, his 103rd birthday.[1][2][3][39] His mother Elsie (1889\u20131987) lived to age 98,[12] and his younger brother Edgar (1915\u20132010), who also had a doctorate in chemistry, reached age 95.[40]\n ", "tags": ["1910 births", "2013 deaths", "American centenarians", "American chemists", "20th-century American inventors", "Fellows of the American Chemical Society", "People from Moscow, Idaho", "People from Spokane, Washington", "University of Idaho alumni", "University of Idaho faculty", "University of Minnesota alumni", "CS1 maint: bot: original URL status unknown", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Malcolm RenfrewBornOctober 12, 1910Spokane, WashingtonDiedOctober 12, 2013(2013-10-12) (aged\u00a0103)Moscow, IdahoResting placeFirst Presbyterian Church Columbarium, Moscow, IdahoNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of IdahoUniversity of MinnesotaKnown\u00a0forTeflon \u00a0(production)Spouse(s)Carol J.
