{"name": "Herbert Busemann", "content": "Herbert Busemann (12 May 1905 \u2013 3 February 1994) was a German-American mathematician specializing in convex and differential geometry.  He is the author of Busemann's theorem in Euclidean geometry and geometric tomography.  He was a member of the Royal Danish Academy and a winner of the Lobachevsky Medal (1985), the first American mathematician to receive it.[1]  He was also a Fulbright scholar in New Zealand in 1952.[2]\n Herbert Busemann was born in Berlin to a well-to-do family.  His father, Alfred Busemann, was a director of Krupp, where Busemann also worked for several years.  He studied at University of Munich, Paris, and Rome. He defended his dissertation in University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1931, where his advisor was Richard Courant. He remained in G\u00f6ttingen as an assistant until 1933, when he escaped Nazi Germany to Copenhagen (he had a Jewish grandfather).[3]  He worked at the University of Copenhagen until 1936, when he left to the United States. There, he got married in 1939 and naturalized in 1943.  He had temporary positions at the Institute of Advanced Studies, Johns Hopkins University, Illinois Institute of Technology, Smith College, and eventually became a professor in 1947 at University of Southern California.[4]  He advanced to a distinguished professor in 1964, and continued working at USC until his retirement in 1970.
