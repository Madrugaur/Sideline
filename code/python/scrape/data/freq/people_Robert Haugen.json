He was vocal concerning the evidence supporting market inefficiency and minimum variance or low volatility anomaly.\n During the academic portion of his career he held endowed professorships at the University of Wisconsin, the University of Illinois, and the University of California. Based on articles published in the top academic journals in financial economics, Haugen has been ranked as the 17th most prolific researcher in finance .[1] The New Finance was required reading for the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam.\n Haugen earned his B.S.
