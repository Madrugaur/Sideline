{"name": "Ferdinand Georg Frobenius", "content": "Ferdinand Georg Frobenius (26 October 1849 \u2013 3 August 1917) was a German mathematician, best known for his contributions to the theory of elliptic functions, differential equations, number theory, and to group theory. He is known for the famous determinantal identities, known as Frobenius\u2013Stickelberger formulae, governing elliptic functions, and for developing the theory of biquadratic forms. He was also the first to introduce the notion of rational approximations of functions (nowadays known as Pad\u00e9 approximants), and gave the first full proof for the Cayley\u2013Hamilton theorem. He also lent his name to certain differential-geometric objects in modern mathematical physics, known as Frobenius manifolds.\n Ferdinand Georg Frobenius was born on 26 October 1849 in Charlottenburg, a suburb of Berlin[1] from parents Christian Ferdinand Frobenius, a Protestant parson, and Christine Elizabeth Friedrich. He entered the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in 1860 when he was nearly eleven.[2] In 1867, after graduating, he went to the University of G\u00f6ttingen where he began his university studies but he only studied there for one semester before returning to Berlin, where he attended lectures by Kronecker, Kummer and Karl Weierstrass. He received his doctorate (awarded with distinction) in 1870 supervised by Weierstrass. His thesis was on the solution of differential equations. In 1874, after having taught at secondary school level first at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium then at the Sophienrealschule, he was appointed to the University of Berlin as an extraordinary professor of mathematics.[2] Frobenius was only in Berlin a year before he went to Z\u00fcrich to take up an appointment as an ordinary professor at the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Polytechnikum. For seventeen years, between 1875 and 1892, Frobenius worked in Z\u00fcrich. It was there that he married, brought up his family, and did much important work in widely differing areas of mathematics. In the last days of December 1891 Kronecker died and, therefore, his chair in Berlin became vacant. Weierstrass, strongly believing that Frobenius was the right person to keep Berlin in the forefront of mathematics, used his considerable influence to have Frobenius appointed. In 1893 he returned to Berlin, where he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.\n Group theory was one of Frobenius' principal interests in the second half of his career. One of his first  contributions was the proof of the Sylow theorems for abstract groups. Earlier proofs had been for permutation groups. His proof of the first Sylow theorem (on the existence of Sylow groups) is one of those frequently used today.\n More important was his creation of the theory of group characters and group representations, which are fundamental tools for studying the structure of groups. This work led to the notion of Frobenius reciprocity and the definition of what are now called Frobenius groups.  A group G is said to be a Frobenius group if there is a subgroup H\u00a0<\u00a0G such that\n In that case, the set\n together with the identity element of G forms a subgroup which is nilpotent as John G. Thompson showed in 1959.[4] All known proofs of that theorem make use of characters. In his first paper about characters (1896), Frobenius constructed the character table of the group \n\n\n\nP\nS\nL\n(\n2\n,\np\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle PSL(2,p)}\n\n of order (1/2)(p3\u00a0\u2212\u00a0p) for all odd primes\u00a0p (this group is simple provided\u00a0p\u00a0>\u00a03). He also made fundamental contributions to the representation theory of the symmetric and alternating groups.\n Frobenius introduced a canonical way of turning primes into conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q.  Specifically, if K/Q is a finite Galois extension then to each (positive) prime p which does not ramify in K and to each prime ideal P lying over p in K there is a unique element g of Gal(K/Q) satisfying the condition g(x)\u00a0=\u00a0xp\u00a0(mod\u00a0P) for all integers x of K. Varying P over p changes g into a conjugate (and every conjugate of g occurs in this way), so the conjugacy class of g in the Galois group is canonically associated to p.  This is called the Frobenius conjugacy class of p and any element of \nthe conjugacy class is called a Frobenius element of p.   If we take for K the mth cyclotomic field, whose Galois group over Q is the units modulo m (and thus \nis abelian, so conjugacy classes become elements), then for p not dividing m the Frobenius class in the Galois group is p\u00a0mod\u00a0m.   From this point of view, \nthe distribution of Frobenius conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q (or, more generally, Galois groups over any number field) generalizes Dirichlet's classical result about primes in arithmetic progressions.   The study of Galois groups of infinite-degree extensions of Q depends crucially on this construction of Frobenius elements, which provides in a sense a dense subset of elements which are accessible to detailed study.\n ", "tags": ["1849 births", "1917 deaths", "19th-century German mathematicians", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Group theorists", "Linear algebraists", "Members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences", "Scientists from Berlin", "People from the Province of Brandenburg", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "Humboldt University of Berlin alumni", "Humboldt University of Berlin faculty", "ETH Zurich faculty", "People from Charlottenburg", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\nFerdinand Georg FrobeniusFerdinand Georg FrobeniusBorn(1849-10-26)26 October 1849Charlottenburg, BerlinDied3 August 1917(1917-08-03) (aged\u00a067)BerlinNationalityGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenUniversity of BerlinKnown\u00a0forDifferential equationsGroup theoryCayley\u2013Hamilton theoremFrobenius methodFrobenius matrixScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of BerlinETH ZurichDoctoral advisorKarl WeierstrassErnst KummerDoctoral studentsRichard FuchsEdmund LandauIssai SchurKonrad KnoppWalter Schnee\n\nFerdinand Georg Frobenius (26 October 1849 \u2013 3 August 1917) was a German mathematician, best known for his contributions to the theory of elliptic functions, differential equations, number theory, and to group theory.

One of his first  contributions was the proof of the Sylow theorems for abstract groups. Earlier proofs had been for permutation groups. His proof of the first Sylow theorem (on the existence of Sylow groups) is one of those frequently used today.\n\nFrobenius also has proved the following fundamental theorem: If a positive integer n divides the order |G| of a finite group G, then the number of solutions of the equation xn\u00a0=\u00a01 in G is equal to kn for some positive integer\u00a0k. He also posed the following problem: If, in the above theorem, k\u00a0=\u00a01, then the solutions of the equation xn\u00a0=\u00a01 in G form a subgroup. Many years ago this problem was solved for solvable groups.[3] Only in 1991, after the classification of finite simple groups, this problem was solved in general.\nMore important was his creation of the theory of group characters and group representations, which are fundamental tools for studying the structure of groups. This work led to the notion of Frobenius reciprocity and the definition of what are now called Frobenius groups.  A group G is said to be a Frobenius group if there is a subgroup H\u00a0<\u00a0G such that\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n\u2229\n\nH\n\nx\n\n\n=\n{\n1\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H\\cap H^{x}=\\{1\\}}\n\n for all \n\n\n\nx\n\u2208\nG\n\u2212\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x\\in G-H}\n\n.\nIn that case, the set\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n=\nG\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\u22c3\n\nx\n\u2208\nG\n\u2212\nH\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N=G\\,-\\!\\!\\bigcup _{x\\in G-H}\\!\\!H^{x}}\n\n\ntogether with the identity element of G forms a subgroup which is nilpotent as John G. Thompson showed in 1959.[4] All known proofs of that theorem make use of characters. In his first paper about characters (1896), Frobenius constructed the character table of the group \n\n\n\nP\nS\nL\n(\n2\n,\np\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle PSL(2,p)}\n\n of order (1/2)(p3\u00a0\u2212\u00a0p) for all odd primes\u00a0p (this group is simple provided\u00a0p\u00a0>\u00a03). He also made fundamental contributions to the representation theory of the symmetric and alternating groups.\n\nContributions to number theory[edit]\nFrobenius introduced a canonical way of turning primes into conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q.  Specifically, if K/Q is a finite Galois extension then to each (positive) prime p which does not ramify in K and to each prime ideal P lying over p in K there is a unique element g of Gal(K/Q) satisfying the condition g(x)\u00a0=\u00a0xp\u00a0(mod\u00a0P) for all integers x of K. Varying P over p changes g into a conjugate (and every conjugate of g occurs in this way), so the conjugacy class of g in the Galois group is canonically associated to p.  This is called the Frobenius conjugacy class of p and any element of \nthe conjugacy class is called a Frobenius element of p.   If we take for K the mth cyclotomic field, whose Galois group over Q is the units modulo m (and thus \nis abelian, so conjugacy classes become elements), then for p not dividing m the Frobenius class in the Galois group is p\u00a0mod\u00a0m.   From this point of view, \nthe distribution of Frobenius conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q (or, more generally, Galois groups over any number field) generalizes Dirichlet's classical result about primes in arithmetic progressions.   The study of Galois groups of infinite-degree extensions of Q depends crucially on this construction of Frobenius elements, which provides in a sense a dense subset of elements which are accessible to detailed study.\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of things named after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius\nPublications[edit]\nFrobenius, Ferdinand Georg (1968),  Serre, J.-P.
