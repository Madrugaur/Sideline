{"name": "\u00d8ystein Ore", "content": "\u00d8ystein Ore (7 October 1899 \u2013 13 August 1968) was a Norwegian mathematician known for his work in ring theory, Galois connections, graph theory, and the history of mathematics.\n Ore graduated from the University of Oslo in 1922, with a Cand.Scient. degree in mathematics. In 1924, the University of Oslo awarded him the Ph.D. for a thesis titled Zur Theorie der algebraischen K\u00f6rper, supervised by Thoralf Skolem.[1] Ore also studied at G\u00f6ttingen University, where he learned Emmy Noether's new approach to abstract algebra. He was also a fellow at the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Sweden, and spent some time at the University of Paris. In 1925, he was appointed research assistant at the University of Oslo.\n Yale University\u2019s James Pierpont went to Europe in 1926 to recruit research mathematicians. In 1927, Yale hired Ore as an assistant professor of mathematics, promoted him to associate professor in 1928, then to full professor in 1929. In 1931, he became a Sterling Professor (Yale's highest academic rank), a position he held until he retired in 1968.\n Ore gave an American Mathematical Society Colloquium lecture in 1941 and was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1936 in Oslo. He was also elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Oslo Academy of Science. He was a founder of the Econometric Society.\n Ore visited Norway nearly every summer. During World War II, he was active in the \"American Relief for Norway\" and \"Free Norway\" movements. In gratitude for the services rendered to his native country during the war, he was decorated in 1947 with the Order of St. Olav.\n In 1930, Ore married Gudrun Lundevall. They had two children. Ore had a passion for painting and sculpture, collected ancient maps, and spoke several languages.\n Ore is known for his work in ring theory, Galois connections, and most of all, graph theory.\n His early work was on algebraic number fields, how to decompose the ideal generated by a prime number into prime ideals. He then worked on noncommutative rings, proving his celebrated theorem on embedding a domain into a division ring. He then examined polynomial rings over skew fields, and attempted to extend his work on factorisation to non-commutative rings. The Ore condition, which (if true) allows a ring of fractions to be defined, and the Ore extension, a non-commutative analogue of rings of polynomials, are part of this work.

He then turned his attention to lattice theory becoming, together with Garrett Birkhoff, one of the two founders of American expertise in the subject.
