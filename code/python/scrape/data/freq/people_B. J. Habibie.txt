Less than three months after his inauguration as the seventh vice president in March 1998, he succeeded Suharto who resigned after 31 years in office. His presidency is seen as a landmark and transition to the Reformation era. Upon becoming president, he liberalized Indonesia's press and political party laws, and held an early democratic election three years sooner than scheduled, which resulted in the end of his presidency. His 517-day presidency and 71-day vice presidency are the shortest in the country's history.\n Habibie was a native of Parepare, in South Sulawesi. Habibie is an ethnic Gorontalese-Javanese descent from Kabila, Gorontalo and Yogyakarta.[1] His parents, Alwi Abdul Jalil Habibie,[1][2] an agriculturist of Gorontalese[3] descent, and R. A. Tuti Marini Puspowardojo,[4] a Javanese noblewoman from Yogyakarta,[5] met while studying in Bogor.[6] Habibie's family comes from Kabila, a village now sits in the eastern part of Gorontalo Province. He was the fourth of eight children.[7] Habibie's father died when he was 14 years old.[7]\n Habibie went to Delft, the Netherlands, to study aviation and aerospace at the Technische Hogeschool Delft (Delft University of Technology), but for political reasons (the West New Guinea dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia), he had to continue his study at the Technische Hochschule Aachen (RWTH Aachen University) in Aachen, Germany.[8] In 1960, Habibie received an engineer's degree in Germany with the title Diplom-Ingenieur. He remained in Germany as a research assistant under Hans Ebner at the Lehrstuhl und Institut f\u00fcr Leichtbau, RWTH Aachen to conduct research for his doctoral degree.[9]\n In 1962, Habibie returned to Indonesia for three months on sick leave. During this time, he was reacquainted with Hasri Ainun, the daughter of R. Mohamad Besari. Habibie had known Hasri Ainun in childhood, junior high school and in senior high school at SMA Kristen Dago (Dago Christian Senior High School), Bandung. The two married on 12 May 1962, returning to Germany shortly afterwards.[10]\nHabibie and his wife settled in Aachen for a short period before moving to Oberforstbach. In May 1963 they had a son, Ilham Akbar Habibie.[11]\n Habibie later found employment with the railway stock firm Waggonfabrik Talbot, where he became an advisor in designing train wagons.[12] Due to his work with Makosh, the head of train construction offered his position to Habibie upon retirement three years later, but Habibie refused the position.[13][12]\n In 1965, Habibie delivered his dissertation in aerospace engineering and received the grade of \"very good,\" giving him the title Doktoringenieur (Dr.-Ing.). The same year, he accepted Hans Ebner's offer to continue his research on Thermoelastisitas and work toward his Habilitation, but he declined the offer to join RWTH as a professor. His thesis about light construction for supersonic or hypersonic states also attracted offers of employment from companies such as Boeing and Airbus, which Habibie again declined.[14]\n Habibie did accept a position with Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm in Hamburg. There, he developed theories on thermodynamics, construction, and aerodynamics known as the Habibie Factor, Habibie Theorem, and Habibie Method, respectively. He worked for Messerschmitt on the development of the Airbus A-300B aircraft. In 1974, he was promoted to vice president of the company.[15]\n In 1974, Suharto recruited Habibie to return to Indonesia as part of his drive to industrialize and develop the country. Habibie initially served as a special assistant to Ibnu Sutowo, chief executive officer of the state oil company Pertamina and Chair of Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (Indonesian: Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi, BPPT). Two years later, Habibie was made CEO of the new state-owned enterprise Industri Pesawat Terbang Nurtanio (IPTN; Nurtanio Aircraft Industry),[15] which in 1985 changed its name to Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (Nusantara Aircraft Industry; also abbreviated as IPTN) and is known as Indonesian Aerospace (PT. Dirgantara Indonesia) since 2000). In 1978, he was appointed as State Minister of Research and Technology (Indonesian: Menteri Negara Riset dan Teknologi, Menristek). He continued to play an important role in IPTN other \"strategic\" industries in this post.[15] By the 1980s, IPTN had grown considerably, specializing in the manufacture of helicopters and small passenger planes. Under Habibie's leadership, IPTN became a manufacturer of aircraft including Puma helicopters and CASA planes. It pioneered a small passenger airplane, the N-250 Gatotkaca, in 1995, but the project was a commercial failure.[16] In developing Indonesia's aviation industry, he adopted an approach called \"Begin at the End and End at the Beginning\".[17] In this method, elements such as basic research became the last things upon which to focus, whilst actual manufacturing of the planes was placed as the first objective.\n By 1991, Habibie oversaw ten state-owned industries including ship- and train-building, steel, arms, communications, and energy.[15] A 1993 estimate determined that the estimates used nearly $2\u00a0billion a year in state funding, although the government's opaque accounting practices meant that the size of the industries was not completely known.[18]\n As minister, Habibie created the OFP (Overseas Fellowship Program), STMDP (Science Technology and Manpower Development Program) and STAID (Science and Technology for Industrial Development). These three programs provided scholarships to thousands of high school graduates to earn their bachelor's degrees in the STEM fields and for other technical professionals to continue their study for master's and doctorate program in the United States, Europe, Japan, and other countries.[19]\n Habibie was, continuously, a member of six Indonesian cabinets for over 20 years. After his initial appointment in 1978, he served in another five cabinets (including the Development Reform Cabinet which, as president he formed after the resignation of Suharto in May 1998):\n In Suharto's regime, as was expected of senior government executives, Habibie became a member of the Golkar organisation. Suharto appointed him as deputy daily coordinator for the chairman of the executive board in 1992, and the following year he became the daily coordinator.[20]\n While serving in cabinet, Habibie was also elected as the first Chair of the Indonesian Association of Muslim Intellectuals (ICMI) in 1990. This modernist Muslim organization provided him with a political base, linked to but independent of the Suharto administration.[21]\n In January 1998, after accepting nomination for a seventh term as President, Suharto announced the selection criteria for the nomination of a vice president. Suharto did not mention Habibie by name, but his suggestion that the next vice president should have a mastery of science and technology made it obvious he had Habibie in mind.[22]\n In that year, in the midst of the Asian Financial Crisis, this suggestion was received badly, causing the rupiah to fall. Despite this, Habibie was elected as Vice President in March 1998.[23]\n On 21 May 1998, just two months into Habibie's vice presidency, Suharto announced his resignation. Habibie, as the Constitution says, succeeded him as president. The following day, Habibie announced the Development Reform Cabinet, which removed some of the most controversial ministers in Suharto's last cabinet while maintaining others - with no major figures from the opposition. Within days of his appointment, he asked his relatives to resign from government positions, promised an early election, repealed some legislation, and ordered the release of political prisoners.[24]\n Habibie was opposed to East Timorese Independence but did offer East Timor special autonomy.[25]\n Timorese independence forces led by the National Council of Timorese Resistance had been calling for a referendum in the territory for some time. Its chief diplomat, Jose Ramos Horta, proposed a transitional period of autonomy leading up to a referendum.[26]  In late 1998, John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, sent a letter to Habibie suggesting that Indonesia defuse the East Timorese issue by providing autonomy to be followed by the promise of a referendum in the long run, following the method used by France to settle New Caledonian demands for independence. Wishing to avoid the impression that Indonesia ruled East Timor as a colony, Habibie surprised some by announcing that a referendum, offering a choice between special autonomy and independence, would be held immediately in East Timor. Leaders of the Indonesian armed forces (ABRI) were not consulted on this decision.[27]\n On 30 August 1999, the referendum was held and the East Timorese people overwhelmingly chose Independence. Subsequently, pro-Indonesia militias killed and displaced large numbers of people during the 1999 East Timorese crisis.[28] On 10 September, General Wiranto allegedly threatened to stage a military coup if Habibie allowed in peacekeeping forces, causing Habibie to back down.[29] On 12 September, however, Habibie accepted a UN-mandated peacekeeping force to halt violence.[27] A UN administration followed and East Timor became independent in 2002.\n The MPR Special Session in November 1998 decried the presence of corruption in Indonesia, focusing particularly on Suharto.[30] In response to this, Habibie then appointed Andi Muhammad Ghalib as Attorney General.[23] A tape of a telephone conversation between Habibie and Ghalib was made public. It raised concerns about the veracity of the investigation by suggesting that the interrogation of Suharto was intended only for public appearances.[31]\n Under Habibie, the Indonesian government also began investigating and prosecuting Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra (commonly known as Tommy Suharto). Ghalib charged Tommy in December 1998 in conjunction with the Goro scandal, where the government, under pressure from Tommy, allegedly gave him a desirable parcel and below-market loan for the construction of a Goro supermarket. However, Tommy was found innocent in the case after several key witnesses, including Habibie aide Rahardi Ramelan, changed their testimony and declared that the deal did not cause losses to the state.[32]\n Habibie's government stabilized the economy in the face of the Asian financial crisis and the chaos of the last few months of Suharto's presidency.[33] Habibie's government began to make conciliatory gestures towards Chinese-Indonesians who, because of their elite status, were targeted in the riots of 1998. In September 1998, Habibie issued a 'Presidential Instruction' forbidding use of the terms pribumi and non-pribumi to differentiate indigenous and non-indigenous Indonesians.[34]\n In May 1999, Habibie directed that an ID card was sufficient proof of Indonesian citizenship, revoking the previous requirement for a 'Letter of Evidence of Republic of Indonesia Citizenship' (SBKRI). Additionally, he lifted restrictions on the teaching of Mandarin Chinese.[35]\n Under Habibie, Indonesia made significant changes to its political system that expanded competition and freedom of speech. Shortly after taking office, in June 1998, Habibie's government lifted the Suharto-era restriction on political parties and ended censorship by dissolving the Information Ministry. He also quickly committed to holding democratic elections, albeit on an initially vague timetable. In December, he proposed political reform laws that were passed by the legislature and MPR. These laws set elections for December 1999, reduced the number of seats in parliament held by the military, and barred political activity by civil servants.[36]\n However, political opponents criticized Habibie for allowing the military to retain some seats in parliament, and taking little action on other military and judicial reforms.[37]\n Habibie's government also passed laws which granted significant autonomy to regional governments, namely at the regency and city level. The laws resulted in indirect elections for mayors and regents, and allowed local legislatures to hold said executives accountable, though it was not implemented until after his presidency.[38]\n Although he had been viewed as leading a transitional government, Habibie seemed determined to continue as president. He was initially unclear about whether he would seek a full term as president when he announced parliamentary elections in June 1998.[36] Habibie faced opposition from many within the government party, Golkar; in July 1998, he struggled to win control of Golkar by appointing Akbar Tandjung as chair of the party, but was ultimately able to defeat a rival camp including former Vice President Try Sutrisno, Defence Minister Edi Sudrajat, Siswono Yudhohusodo, and Sarwono Kusumaatmadja.[39] Habibie began to lose support from Akbar Tandjung and a faction in Golkar, composed of both reformers and hardliners, that wanted to oust him. In March 1999, Golkar put forth five presidential nominees: Habibie, Tandjung, Wiranto, Hamengkubuwono X, and Ginandjar Kartasasmita.[40] In May 1999, after extensive lobbying, Golkar announced that Habibie would be their presidential candidate, but a large faction in the party remained loyal to Tandjung and opposed to Habibie.[41] His political credibility was tarnished by the exposure of the 1999 Bank Bali scandal, in which banking funds were funneled to members of Habibie's re-election team.[42]\n At the 1999 MPR General Session in October, Habibie delivered an accountability speech. MPR members then began voting to decide if they would accept or reject his speech. Habibie attempted to win the support of the military by offering the vice-presidency to General Wiranto, but his offer was declined.[43] Tandjung's Golkar faction broke ranks and voted against him, and his accountability speech was rejected by 355 votes to 322, and Habibie withdrew his nomination as President.[44] He was succeeded by Abdurrahman Wahid.\n After relinquishing the presidency, Habibie spent more time in Germany than in Indonesia, though he was active during Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's presidency as a presidential adviser. During this time, he established the Habibie Centre, an independent think tank.[45]\n In September 2006, he released a book called Detik-Detik Yang Menentukan: Jalan Panjang Indonesia Menuju Demokrasi (Decisive Moments: Indonesia's Long Road Towards Democracy). The book recalled the events of May 1998 which led to his rise to the Presidency. In the book, he controversially accused Lieutenant General Prabowo Subianto, Suharto's son-in-law (at that time) and the Kostrad Commander, of planning a coup d'\u00e9tat against him in May 1998.[46]\n In early September 2019, he was admitted to Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, where he was undergoing treatments for heart problems,[47][48] namely cardiomyopathy,[49] and died on 11 September 2019.[50][51][52][53][54] He became the first Indonesian President to be buried at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery, next to his wife's grave.[55]\n In response to his death, the Government of Indonesia announced a three-day national mourning period starting on 12 September, and announced that the Indonesian flag is to be flown at half-staff during the period.[56]\n On 12 September 2019, video was released showing East Timor's former President, Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, visiting Habibie in hospital on 22 July 2019. Gusm\u00e3o is shown talking briefly to Habibie while crying, then kissing Habibie on the forehead and lowering his face to Habibie\u2019s chest, with the other holding his head. A wreath in Gusm\u00e3o\u2019s name was at the funeral, with a sign reading: \"Profound Condolences \u2013 With heartfelt sympathy for the loss of Big Brother President B.J. Habibie \u2013 Timorese people will remember you forever \u2013 Rest in Peace - Xanana Gusm\u00e3o\".[57]\n Habibie was married to Hasri Ainun Besari, a medical doctor, from 12 May 1962 until her death on 22 May 2010. Their wedding was held in Javanese and Gorontalese culture.[58] The couple had two sons, Ilham Akbar Habibie and Thareq Kemal Habibie.\n B. J. Habibie's brother, Junus Effendi Habibie, was Indonesian ambassador to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.[59][60] After his wife's death, Habibie published a book titled Habibie & Ainun which recounts his relationship with Hasri Ainun from their courtship until her death. The book was adapted into a film of the same name which was released on 20 December 2012.[61]\n Habibie received several honorary degrees for his contributions in the fields of technology and science, e.g. he was awarded an Honorary DSc degree from the Cranfield Institute of Technology (United Kingdom) and Dr.h.c. degrees from Chungbuk National University and Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (South Korea) for his services to aircraft technology.[62] In 2010, Habibie was honored with an Honorary PhD degree in Technology by the University of Indonesia for his contribution to science in practice as a technocrat.[63]\n Habibie was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng) in 1990.[64] In 1993, he was awarded an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society (HonFRAeS).[65] He was also named an honorary member of several professional bodies, including:\n Timor-Leste named a bridge and park in Dili after Habibie shortly before his death.[52]\n As vice president, and later president of Indonesia, he was automatically bestowed the highest class of all civilian and military Star Decorations from Indonesia and received some foreign decorations, namely:[66][67]\n Habibie has been portrayed in several biopic movies based on both his political and personal life. In the first installment of Habibie & Ainun (2012) and its prequels, Rudy Habibie (2016) and Habibie & Ainun 3\u00a0[id] (2019), Habibie is portrayed by Reza Rahadian, while Bima Azriel and Bastian Bintang Simbolon portrayed Habibie[71] during his childhood, and teenage years in Rudy Habibie respectively.\n In the movie Di Balik 98, Habibie was portrayed by Agus Kuncoro.\n ", "tags": ["1936 births", "2019 deaths", "Indonesian Muslims", "Politicians from South Sulawesi", "Bandung Institute of Technology alumni", "Javanese people", "Presidents of Indonesia", "Vice Presidents of Indonesia", "Suharto family and associates", "Habibie family", "RWTH Aachen University alumni", "Golkar politicians", "German people of Indonesian descent", "Naturalized citizens of Germany", "People from Parepare", "Indonesian engineers", "CS1 Indonesian-language sources (id)", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from May 2020", "Articles with hAudio microformats", "Articles containing Indonesian-language text", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Articles containing video clips"], "raw": "\"Habibie\" redirects here.

It raised concerns about the veracity of the investigation by suggesting that the interrogation of Suharto was intended only for public appearances.[31]\nUnder Habibie, the Indonesian government also began investigating and prosecuting Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra (commonly known as Tommy Suharto). Ghalib charged Tommy in December 1998 in conjunction with the Goro scandal, where the government, under pressure from Tommy, allegedly gave him a desirable parcel and below-market loan for the construction of a Goro supermarket. However, Tommy was found innocent in the case after several key witnesses, including Habibie aide Rahardi Ramelan, changed their testimony and declared that the deal did not cause losses to the state.[32]\nHabibie's government stabilized the economy in the face of the Asian financial crisis and the chaos of the last few months of Suharto's presidency.[33] Habibie's government began to make conciliatory gestures towards Chinese-Indonesians who, because of their elite status, were targeted in the riots of 1998. In September 1998, Habibie issued a 'Presidential Instruction' forbidding use of the terms pribumi and non-pribumi to differentiate indigenous and non-indigenous Indonesians.[34]\nIn May 1999, Habibie directed that an ID card was sufficient proof of Indonesian citizenship, revoking the previous requirement for a 'Letter of Evidence of Republic of Indonesia Citizenship' (SBKRI). Additionally, he lifted restrictions on the teaching of Mandarin Chinese.[35]\n\nPolitical reform[edit]\nUnder Habibie, Indonesia made significant changes to its political system that expanded competition and freedom of speech. Shortly after taking office, in June 1998, Habibie's government lifted the Suharto-era restriction on political parties and ended censorship by dissolving the Information Ministry. He also quickly committed to holding democratic elections, albeit on an initially vague timetable. In December, he proposed political reform laws that were passed by the legislature and MPR. These laws set elections for December 1999, reduced the number of seats in parliament held by the military, and barred political activity by civil servants.[36]\nHowever, political opponents criticized Habibie for allowing the military to retain some seats in parliament, and taking little action on other military and judicial reforms.[37]\nHabibie's government also passed laws which granted significant autonomy to regional governments, namely at the regency and city level. The laws resulted in indirect elections for mayors and regents, and allowed local legislatures to hold said executives accountable, though it was not implemented until after his presidency.[38]\n\nEnd of presidency[edit]\nAlthough he had been viewed as leading a transitional government, Habibie seemed determined to continue as president. He was initially unclear about whether he would seek a full term as president when he announced parliamentary elections in June 1998.[36] Habibie faced opposition from many within the government party, Golkar; in July 1998, he struggled to win control of Golkar by appointing Akbar Tandjung as chair of the party, but was ultimately able to defeat a rival camp including former Vice President Try Sutrisno, Defence Minister Edi Sudrajat, Siswono Yudhohusodo, and Sarwono Kusumaatmadja.[39] Habibie began to lose support from Akbar Tandjung and a faction in Golkar, composed of both reformers and hardliners, that wanted to oust him. In March 1999, Golkar put forth five presidential nominees: Habibie, Tandjung, Wiranto, Hamengkubuwono X, and Ginandjar Kartasasmita.[40] In May 1999, after extensive lobbying, Golkar announced that Habibie would be their presidential candidate, but a large faction in the party remained loyal to Tandjung and opposed to Habibie.[41] His political credibility was tarnished by the exposure of the 1999 Bank Bali scandal, in which banking funds were funneled to members of Habibie's re-election team.[42]\nAt the 1999 MPR General Session in October, Habibie delivered an accountability speech. MPR members then began voting to decide if they would accept or reject his speech. Habibie attempted to win the support of the military by offering the vice-presidency to General Wiranto, but his offer was declined.[43] Tandjung's Golkar faction broke ranks and voted against him, and his accountability speech was rejected by 355 votes to 322, and Habibie withdrew his nomination as President.[44] He was succeeded by Abdurrahman Wahid.\n\nPost-presidency, final years and death[edit]\n State funeral procession of Habibie at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery in Jakarta, 12 September 2019\nAfter relinquishing the presidency, Habibie spent more time in Germany than in Indonesia, though he was active during Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's presidency as a presidential adviser. During this time, he established the Habibie Centre, an independent think tank.[45]\nIn September 2006, he released a book called Detik-Detik Yang Menentukan: Jalan Panjang Indonesia Menuju Demokrasi (Decisive Moments: Indonesia's Long Road Towards Democracy). The book recalled the events of May 1998 which led to his rise to the Presidency. In the book, he controversially accused Lieutenant General Prabowo Subianto, Suharto's son-in-law (at that time) and the Kostrad Commander, of planning a coup d'\u00e9tat against him in May 1998.[46]\nIn early September 2019, he was admitted to Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, where he was undergoing treatments for heart problems,[47][48] namely cardiomyopathy,[49] and died on 11 September 2019.[50][51][52][53][54] He became the first Indonesian President to be buried at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery, next to his wife's grave.[55]\nIn response to his death, the Government of Indonesia announced a three-day national mourning period starting on 12 September, and announced that the Indonesian flag is to be flown at half-staff during the period.[56]\nOn 12 September 2019, video was released showing East Timor's former President, Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, visiting Habibie in hospital on 22 July 2019. Gusm\u00e3o is shown talking briefly to Habibie while crying, then kissing Habibie on the forehead and lowering his face to Habibie\u2019s chest, with the other holding his head. A wreath in Gusm\u00e3o\u2019s name was at the funeral, with a sign reading: \"Profound Condolences \u2013 With heartfelt sympathy for the loss of Big Brother President B.J. Habibie \u2013 Timorese people will remember you forever \u2013 Rest in Peace - Xanana Gusm\u00e3o\".[57]\n\nFamily[edit]\n Habibie and Ainun wedding attire in Gorontalonese culture\nHabibie was married to Hasri Ainun Besari, a medical doctor, from 12 May 1962 until her death on 22 May 2010. Their wedding was held in Javanese and Gorontalese culture.[58] The couple had two sons, Ilham Akbar Habibie and Thareq Kemal Habibie.\nB. J. Habibie's brother, Junus Effendi Habibie, was Indonesian ambassador to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.[59][60] After his wife's death, Habibie published a book titled Habibie & Ainun which recounts his relationship with Hasri Ainun from their courtship until her death. The book was adapted into a film of the same name which was released on 20 December 2012.[61]\n\nHonours, decorations, and distinctions[edit]\nHabibie received several honorary degrees for his contributions in the fields of technology and science, e.g. he was awarded an Honorary DSc degree from the Cranfield Institute of Technology (United Kingdom) and Dr.h.c. degrees from Chungbuk National University and Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (South Korea) for his services to aircraft technology.[62] In 2010, Habibie was honored with an Honorary PhD degree in Technology by the University of Indonesia for his contribution to science in practice as a technocrat.[63]\nHabibie was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng) in 1990.[64] In 1993, he was awarded an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society (HonFRAeS).[65] He was also named an honorary member of several professional bodies, including:\n\n\nMalaysian Engineers Association (IEM)\nJapanese Academy of Engineering\nFellowship of Engineering of the United Kingdom, London\nNational Academy of Engineering, USA\nAcademie Nationale de l'Air et de l'Espace, France\nRoyal Aeronautical Society, UK\nRoyal Swedish Academy of Engineering Science\nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Institute for Aviation & Space), Germany\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, USA\nTimor-Leste named a bridge and park in Dili after Habibie shortly before his death.[52]\n\n Habibie's official presidential state portrait with the highest decorations he earned\nAs vice president, and later president of Indonesia, he was automatically bestowed the highest class of all civilian and military Star Decorations from Indonesia and received some foreign decorations, namely:[66][67]\n\nNational honours[edit]\n Star of the Republic of Indonesia, 1st Class (Indonesian: Bintang Republik Indonesia Adipurna) (27 May 1998)[68]\n Star of the Republic of Indonesia, 2nd Class (Indonesian: Bintang Republik Indonesia Adipradana) (12 March 1998)[68]\n Star of Mahaputera, 1st Class (Indonesian: Bintang Mahaputera Adipurna) (12 March 1998)[69]\n Star of Mahaputera, 2nd Class (Indonesian: Bintang Mahaputera Adipradana) (17 August 1982)[69]\n Star of Merit, 1st Class (Indonesian: Bintang Jasa Utama) (27 May 1998)\n Star of Culture Parama Dharma (Indonesian: Bintang Budaya Parama Dharma) (27 May 1998)[70]\n Star of Yudha Dharma, 1st Class (Indonesian: Bintang Yudha Dharma Utama) (27 May 1998)\n Star of Kartika Eka Paksi, 1st Class (Indonesian: Bintang Kartika Eka Paksi Utama) (27 May 1998)\n Star of Jalasena, 1st Class (Indonesian: Bintang Jalasena Utama) (27 May 1998)\n Star of Swa Bhuwana Paksa, 1st Class (Indonesian: Bintang Swa Bhuwana Paksa Utama) (27 May 1998)\n Star of Bhayangkara, 1st Class (Indonesian: Bintang Bhayangkara Utama) (27 May 1998)\n Military Instructor Service Medal (Indonesian: Satyalancana Dwidya Sistha) (9 August 1982)\nForeign honours[edit]\n\u00a0Germany:\n Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (11 November 1980)\n\u00a0Lower Saxony:\n Commander's Cross (Gro\u00dfes Verdienstkreuz) of the Lower Saxony Order of Merit (1 December 1980)\n\u00a0Jordan:\n Grand Cordon of the Order of Independence (Wisam al-Istiqial) (14 April 1986)\n\u00a0Netherlands:\n Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau (25 May 1983)\n\u00a0Spain:\n Grand Cross of the Order of Civil Merit (14 May 1980)\n\u00a0Chile:\n Grand Cross of Aeronautical Merit (3 October 1985)\nIn popular culture[edit]\nMovies[edit]\nHabibie has been portrayed in several biopic movies based on both his political and personal life.
