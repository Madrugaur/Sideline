{"name": "J\u00f6rg Schlaich", "content": "J\u00f6rg Schlaich (born 1934) is a German structural engineer and is known internationally for his ground-breaking work in the creative design of bridges, long-span roofs, and other complex structures. He is a co-founder of the structural engineering and consulting firm schlaich bergermann partner.\n He is the brother of the architect Brigitte Schlaich Peterhans.[1]\n J\u00f6rg Schlaich studied architecture and civil engineering from 1953 to 1955 at Stuttgart University before completing his studies at the Technical University of Berlin in 1959. He spent 1959-60 at the Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, United States.\n In 1963, he joined the firm Leonhardt & Andr\u00e4, the firm founded by Fritz Leonhardt.\n Schlaich was made a partner and was responsible for the Alster-Schwimmhalle in Hamburg, and more importantly, the Olympic Stadium in Munich. He stayed with the firm until 1969.\n In 1974 he became an academic at Stuttgart University, and in 1980 he founded his own firm, schlaich bergermann partner.\n In 1993, with the roof of the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion (since 2008 Mercedes-Benz-Arena) in Stuttgart, he introduced the \"speichenrad\" principle to structural engineering. Indeed, this principle was employed the first time in the history of Structural Engineering by the Italian engineer Massimo Majowiecki, the designer of the roof of the Olympic Stadium, Rome (built in 1990, three years before the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion). Since then, his company has successfully employed it to stadium projects across the globe. Other structures include the observation tower at the Killesbergpark in Stuttgart. Most of his work as well of that of his company is documented on their website. He is also the developer of the solar tower (or solar chimney) and is largely credited with inventing the strut and tie model for reinforced concrete.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1934 births", "Living people", "People from Rems-Murr-Kreis", "People from the Free People's State of W\u00fcrttemberg", "Bridge engineers", "German civil engineers", "Structural engineers", "Tensile architecture", "Tensile membrane structures", "Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin", "IStructE Gold Medal winners", "Werner von Siemens Ring laureates", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "J\u00f6rg SchlaichBorn1934 (age\u00a086\u201387)Stetten im RemstalNationalityGermanEducationStuttgart UniversityTechnical University of BerlinCase Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United StatesOccupationEngineerEngineering careerDisciplineStructural engineerInstitutionsInstitution of Structural EngineersPractice nameSchlaich Bergermann & PartnerProjectsOlympic Stadium, MunichGottlieb-Daimler-StadionSolar updraft towerSignificant advancestrut and tie model for reinforced concreteAwardsIStructE Gold Medal, Werner von Siemens Ring, Award of Merit in Structural Engineering, Jos\u00e9-Entrecanales-Ibarra-award\n\nJ\u00f6rg Schlaich (born 1934) is a German structural engineer and is known internationally for his ground-breaking work in the creative design of bridges, long-span roofs, and other complex structures.
