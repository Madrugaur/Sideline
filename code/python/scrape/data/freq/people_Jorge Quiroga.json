{"name": "Jorge Quiroga", "content": "Jorge Fernando  Quiroga Ram\u00edrez (born May 5, 1960), nicknamed Tuto Quiroga, is a Bolivian politician who served as the 62nd President of Bolivia from 2001 to 2002, previously serving as the 36th Vice President of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001 under President Hugo Banzer, assuming the presidency following Banzer's resignation due to terminal illness,[1]\n Quiroga was a candidate in the 2005 and 2014 presidential elections, in which President Evo Morales was succesffuly elected for a first and third term respectively. In both elections, Quiroga for the Christian Democratic Party. In the 2020 presidential election, Quiroga ran as a candidate for the Libre21 coalition, but withdrew his candidacy on October 11, 2020 (seven days prior to the election) along with two other candidates in an unsuccessful attempt to unify the Bolivian opposition and prevent the socialist MAS-IPSP candidate Luis Arce from emerging victorious.[2]\n Quiroga was born in Cochabamba. He graduated from Texas A&M University in 1981 with a degree in industrial engineering, becoming the first head of state from that university.[3] He went on to work for IBM in Austin, Texas[3] while earning a master's degree in business administration from St. Edward's University. He and his American wife Virginia then moved back to Bolivia.[3] He has 4 children: Vanessa Elena, Cristina Andrea, Adriana Patricia and Jorge Cristian.\n Quiroga was Minister of Finance from 1992 to 1993.[4] He was elected as Vice President of Bolivia in 1997 running on the Nationalist Democratic Action ticket with former dictator Hugo Banzer.[5] At 37, he was the youngest vice president in Bolivia's history.\n He became President when Banzer resigned because of aggravated health problems (he died a year following his resignation). Quiroga assumed office as acting president on July 1, 2001 and was sworn-in on August 7, to complete Banzer's five-year mandate.\n Soon after becoming President he told a reporter from the New Yorker \"We [Bolivia] will be the vital heart of South America..\" believing that gas exports would lift the economy, that a long-anticipated transcontinental highway connecting Brazil to Chile would be built passing through the Bolivian city of Cochabamba, and that fibre-optic cables would soon be laid.[3] He blamed Bolivia\u2019s lack of economic progress on hypocrisy on free trade in  the United States and Europe, saying \"Bolivia is the most open economy in Latin America. Meanwhile, American and European farm subsidies, along with tariffs on textiles and agricultural products, make it impossible for Bolivia to sell its exports in the Global North. They tell us to be competitive while tying our arms behind our backs.\"[3] When asked about the Bolivian Water Wars of 2000, he said \u201cA lot of things certainly could have been different along the way, from a lot of different actors. The net effect is that we have a city today with no resolution to the water problem. In the end it will be necessary to bring in private investment to develop the water.\"[3]\n Quiroga ran for President in his own right in the 2005 election, as the candidate for a new right-of-center coalition known as Social and Democratic Power (PODEMOS), which included the bulk of Banzer's former ADN organization. His main opponent was the leftist Evo Morales of the Movement Towards Socialism. Morales won the election and Quiroga finished a distant second place, receiving 28.6% of the vote.\n He has also worked as a consultant for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In 2002, he was honored in a tribute exhibit at his alma mater, Texas A&M University.[6] He is, as of November 2016, active in the private sector and many international organizations, among them: as Vice-President of Club de Madrid with almost 100 former heads of state and government; on the board of Results for Development-R4D in Washington D.C.; as a member of the Inter-American Dialogue and the International Advisory Council of the China Economic Club; and in different capacities on the Global Adaptation Institute, the Foro Iberoamericano and many others.[7] He has presided FUNDEMOS since 2002, a Bolivian public policy foundation. His areas of expertise are: management of international aid and cooperation for developing countries; macroeconomic policy; constitutional, legal and institutional reforms; private and official external debt restructuring and relief; programs to reduce drug trafficking and cocaine production; and broadly in Latin American public policy, trade, economics, finance and banking, integration, politics and development issues.[7]\n He was appointed as vice president of the Club de Madrid in 2011.[8]\n In 2020, Qurioga announced his candidacy for the snap elections in Bolivia as a Revolutionary Nationalist Movement member. Throughout the election cycle, he remained around sixth place reaching between 1 to 2% in opinion polling and never surpassing 7%. On 11 October, one week before the scheduled election, Quiroga announced he was dropping out of the presidential race. He indicated in his withdrawal announcement that he wished to prevent an outright victory of Luis Arce of the Movement for Socialism party in the first electoral round by consolidating the right around Carlos Mesa.[9]\n ", "tags": ["1960 births", "People from Cochabamba", "Bolivian Roman Catholics", "Living people", "Presidents of Bolivia", "Texas A&M University alumni", "Vice Presidents of Bolivia", "Ministers of Economics and Finance of Bolivia", "Candidates in the 2005 Bolivian presidential election", "Nationalist Democratic Action politicians", "Social Democratic Power politicians", "21st-century Bolivian politicians", "Articles with Spanish-language sources (es)", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "In this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Quiroga and the second or maternal family name is  Ram\u00edrez.\nJorge QuirogaJorge Quiroga in June 201962nd President of BoliviaIn officeAugust 7, 2001\u00a0\u2013 August 6, 2002Vice PresidentVacantPreceded byHugo B\u00e1nzer Su\u00e1rezSucceeded byGonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada36th Vice President of BoliviaIn officeAugust 6, 1997\u00a0\u2013 August 7, 2001PresidentHugo B\u00e1nzer Su\u00e1rezPreceded byV\u00edctor Hugo C\u00e1rdenasSucceeded byVacant (Carlos Mesa elected in 2002)\nPersonal detailsBorn (1960-05-05) May 5, 1960 (age\u00a060)Cochabamba, BoliviaPolitical partyADN (before 2005)PODEMOS (2002\u201305)PDC (2005\u20132020)MNR (2020\u2013present)Spouse(s)Virginia Gillum de QuirogaChildren4Alma materTexas A&M University  St. Edward's UniversityProfessionIndustrial engineerSignature\nJorge Fernando  Quiroga Ram\u00edrez (born May 5, 1960), nicknamed Tuto Quiroga, is a Bolivian politician who served as the 62nd President of Bolivia from 2001 to 2002, previously serving as the 36th Vice President of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001 under President Hugo Banzer, assuming the presidency following Banzer's resignation due to terminal illness,[1]\nQuiroga was a candidate in the 2005 and 2014 presidential elections, in which President Evo Morales was succesffuly elected for a first and third term respectively.
