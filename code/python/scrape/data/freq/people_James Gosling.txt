{"name": "James Gosling", "content": "IEEE John von Neumann Medal\nThe Economist Innovation Award\nNAE Foreign Member\n James Arthur Gosling, often referred to as \"Dr. Java\", OC (born May 19, 1955) is a Canadian computer scientist, best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java programming language.[3]\n James Gosling received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Calgary [4] and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University, all in computer science.[2][5][6] He wrote a version of Emacs called Gosling Emacs (Gosmacs) while working toward his doctorate. He built a multi-processor version of Unix for a 16-way computer system[7] while at Carnegie Mellon University, before joining Sun Microsystems. He also developed several compilers and mail systems there.\n Gosling was with Sun Microsystems between 1984 and 2010 (26 years). At Sun he invented an early Unix windowing system called NeWS, which became a lesser-used alternative to the still used X Window, because Sun did not give it an open source license.[citation needed]\n He is known as the father of the Java programming language.[8][9] He got the idea for the Java VM while writing a program to port software from a PERQ by translating Perq Q-Code to VAX assembler and emulating the hardware. He is generally credited with having invented the Java programming language in 1994.[10][11][12]\nHe created the original design of Java and implemented the language's original compiler and virtual machine.[13] Gosling traces the origins of the approach to his early graduate student days, when he created a p-code virtual machine for the lab's DEC VAX computer, so that his professor could run programs written in UCSD Pascal.  In the work leading to Java at Sun, he saw that architecture-neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be achieved by implementing a similar philosophy:  always program for the same virtual machine.[14] Another contribution of Gosling's was co-writing the \"bundle\" program, known as \"shar\", a utility thoroughly detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike's book The Unix Programming Environment.[15]\n He left Sun Microsystems on April 2, 2010, after it was acquired by the Oracle Corporation,[8] citing reductions in pay, status, and decision-making ability, along with change of role and ethical challenges.[16] He has since taken a very critical stance towards Oracle in interviews, noting that \"during the integration meetings between Sun and Oracle, where we were being grilled about the patent situation between Sun and Google, we could see the Oracle lawyer's eyes sparkle.\"[9] He clarified his position during the Oracle v. Google trial over Android: \"While I have differences with Oracle, in this case they are in the right. Google totally slimed Sun. We were all really disturbed, even Jonathan [Schwartz]: he just decided to put on a happy face and tried to turn lemons into lemonade, which annoyed a lot of folks at Sun.\"[17] However, he approved of the court's ruling that APIs should not be copyrightable.[18]\n In March 2011, Gosling joined Google.[19] Six months later, he followed his colleague Bill Vass and joined a startup called Liquid Robotics.[1] In late 2016, Liquid Robotics was acquired by Boeing.[20] Following the acquisition, Gosling left Liquid Robotics to work at Amazon Web Services as Distinguished Engineer in May 2017.[21]\n He is an advisor at the Scala company Lightbend,[22] Independent Director at Jelastic,[23] and Strategic Advisor for Eucalyptus,[24] and is a board member of DIRTT Environmental Solutions.[25]\n He is known for his love of proving \"the unknown\"[clarification needed] and has noted but later clarified to be untrue that his favorite irrational number is \u221a2.  He has a framed picture of the first 1,000 digits of \u221a2 in his office.[26]\n For his achievement, the National Academy of Engineering in the United States elected him as a Foreign Associate member.[27]\n ", "tags": ["1955 births", "Canadian bloggers", "Canadian computer programmers", "Canadian computer scientists", "Canadian inventors", "Carnegie Mellon University alumni", "Emacs", "Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery", "Free software programmers", "Java (programming language)", "Living people", "Officers of the Order of Canada", "Open source people", "People from Calgary", "Programming language designers", "Solaris people", "Sun Microsystems people", "University of Calgary alumni", "Winners of The Economist innovation awards", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Engineering", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from September 2019", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from May 2020", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Canadian computer scientist\nFor the former Louisiana sheriff, see James M.
