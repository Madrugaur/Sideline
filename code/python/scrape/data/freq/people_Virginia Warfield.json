{"name": "Virginia Warfield", "content": "Virginia Patricia McShane Warfield is an American mathematician and mathematical educator. She received the Louise Hay Award from the Association for Women in Mathematics in 2007.[1]\n Warfield's father was mathematician Edward J. McShane.[2] She received her Ph.D. in mathematics from Brown University in 1971. Her doctoral advisor was Wendell Fleming and the title of her dissertation was A Stochastic Minimum Principle.[3]\n While making contributions to the field of stochastic analysis after her Ph.D., Warfield became more and more engrossed by the problems of mathematics education. She worked with Project SEED, a highly regarded mathematics program whose goal was to promote sense-making mathematical activities for fourth through sixth graders. She addressed issues of teacher preparation and enhancement. She collaborated with the French mathematician Guy\nBrousseau, a pioneer in the \u201cdidactics of mathematics,\u201d the scientific study of issues in mathematics teaching and learning.[4] She has been an active member of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM).
