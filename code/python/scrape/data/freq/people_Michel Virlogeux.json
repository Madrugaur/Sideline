{"name": "Michel Virlogeux", "content": "Dr. Michel Virlogeux FREng[2] CorrFRSE (born 1946, Vichy, Allier, Auvergne) is a French structural engineer and bridge specialist.\n Virlogeux graduated from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1967 and from the \u00c9cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es in 1970. From 1970 to 1973 he served in Tunisia on road projects and at the same time gained his Engineering Doctorate from the Pierre et Marie Curie University (also known as \"Paris 6\"). In January 1974 he joined the Bridge Department of SETRA, the technical service of the French Highway Administration.\n In 1980 he became Head of the Large Concrete Bridge Division, and in 1987 of the large Bridge Division, Steel and Concrete. During twenty years he designed more than 100 bridges, including the Normandy Bridge which held the world record for longest cable-stayed bridge for four years. In 1995 he left the French Administration and set up as independent consulting engineer; his major achievements include his participation in the construction of the 'Second Tagus Crossing', the Vasco da Gama Bridge in Lisbon, and the design of the Millau Viaduct in France. Several of his bridges have received architectural awards.\n Since 1977 Dr Virlogeux has been a part-time professor of structural analysis at the prestigious \u00c9cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es and at the \"Centre des Hautes \u00c9tudes de la Construction\" in Paris. He also has been very active in technical associations such as the French Association of Civil Engineering (AFGC), 1974\u20131995; the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Pr\u00e9contrainte (FIP) (President 1996); the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du B\u00e9ton (FIB); first President in 1998 after the merger with the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en du B\u00e9ton (CEB).\n A member of the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering (IABSE)[3] since 1974, Dr. Virlogeux received the inaugural IABSE Prize in Venice in 1983.\n He has received many other international awards, which include the 'Award of Excellence of the Engineering News Record' (1995), the 'Gold Medal of the Institution of Structural Engineers' (1979), the Gold Medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers (2005)[4] the 'Gustave Magnel Medal' (1999) and the 'Fritz Leonhardt Prize' (also the first year that it was awarded). He is a member of the French Academy of Technology.\n He received the 2003 IABSE Award of Merit in Structural Engineering in recognition of \"his major contributions leading to very significant progress in the field of civil engineering, in particular through the development of external prestressing, landmark cable-stayed bridges and composite structures\". The Award Presentation took place during the Opening of the IABSE Symposium 'Structures for High-Speed Railway Transportation', Antwerp, Belgium on 27 August 2003. The presentation was presented by Dr. Manabu Ito, President of IABSE.\n In 2010 he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject \"The Design of Long Span Bridges\".[5]\n He was appointed an International Fellow[6] of the Royal Academy of Engineering[7] in 2012 and Corresponding Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2013.[8]\n ", "tags": ["1946 births", "Living people", "IStructE Gold Medal winners", "French bridge engineers", "French civil engineers", "Structural engineers", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni", "\u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech alumni", "Corps des ponts", "Viaduct engineers", "Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Michel VirlogeuxMichel Virlogeux (2011)Born (1946-07-07) 7 July 1946 (age\u00a074)Vichy, Allier, Auvergne, FranceNationalityFrenchEducationPrytan\u00e9e National Militaire\u00c9cole Polytechnique\u00c9cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9esOccupationEngineerEngineering careerDisciplineCivil engineerInstitutionsFrench Association of Civil Engineering (AFGC)'F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Pr\u00e9contrainte' (FIP) 'F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du B\u00e9ton' (FIB) Institution of Structural EngineersProjectsMillau Viaduct, FranceVasco da Gama Bridge, Lisbon, PortugalYavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, Istanbul, TurkeyAwardsIStructE Gold Medal IABSE Award of MeritFritz Leonhardt PrizeFREng[1] (2012)\n\nDr. Michel Virlogeux FREng[2] CorrFRSE (born 1946, Vichy, Allier, Auvergne) is a French structural engineer and bridge specialist.\n\nContents\n\n1 Career\n2 Awards\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nCareer[edit]\nVirlogeux graduated from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1967 and from the \u00c9cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es in 1970.
