{"name": "Lucy Joan Slater", "content": "Lucy Joan Slater (5 January 1922 \u2013 6 June 2008) was a mathematician who worked on hypergeometric functions, and who found many generalizations of the  Rogers\u2013Ramanujan identities.\n Slater was born in 1922 and homeschooled for much of her early education. Her father passed away when she was nine years old. Slater was interested in jazz music and played the piano as an accompanist in her early years.[1] She attended college at Bedford College and received her first B.A. from London University in 1944. During the war, she worked teaching soldiers trigonometry.[1]\n Her advisor was Wilfrid Norman Bailey.[2] She received an M.A. and Ph.D from London University while studying hypergeometric equations, including her publication a list of over 100 Rogers-Ramanujan Identities.[3] Later, she received a D.Litt. from London University as well. In the early 1950s she played a leading role at Cambridge University in devising a precursor of modern computer operating systems, and subsequently she helped to develop computer programs for econometrics, working for much of the time with UK government officials. She received a Ph.D. and Sc.D. from Cambridge and was named Assistant Director of Research in the Department of Economics in 1962.[1]\n She retired in 1982 and subsequently devoted much of her time to genealogy.\n Her (unpublished) memoirs include descriptions of life as a teenager in Portsmouth during the bombing of the Second World War, and of working with early computers at Cambridge. In 1997 she completed a remarkable listing of all the graves at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge and their inscriptions in the burial ground; she wrote a paper called \"A Walk round the Ascension Burial Ground, Cambridge\" which describes over 100 of the graves as though the reader is walking around the burial ground and includes detailed maps. The fourth edition is dated December 1994.\n She was buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge in 2008 in the same grave as her mother, Lucy Dalton Slater (1893\u20131975), widow of John Wardle Slater F.I.C., Admiralty chemist, buried in Portsmouth.[4]\n In 2016 the Council of the University of Cambridge approved the use of Slater's name to mark a physical feature within the North West Cambridge Development.[5]\n ", "tags": ["20th-century British mathematicians", "21st-century British mathematicians", "British women mathematicians", "2008 deaths", "1922 births", "20th-century British women scientists", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from November 2019", "All articles needing additional references", "CS1 errors: URL", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "British mathematician (1922-2008)\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
