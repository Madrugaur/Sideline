Once the regime was overthrown, the family moved back to Budapest. Her family was wealthy, and often held parties where D\u00e1n would meet many different people from various stations in life.\n At 14, D\u00e1n became a national champion in figure skating.[4] She attended Veres P\u00e1ln\u00e9 Gimn\u00e1zium\u00a0[hu] in Budapest and graduated in 1929.[6]\n D\u00e1n married Ferenc Engel in 1931 and Andor Rapoch in 1936.[7] She met Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann during a trip he made to Budapest prior to the outbreak of World War II.[8] In 1938, von Neumann's first marriage ended in a divorce, and D\u00e1n divorced Rapoch to marry him.\n After their wedding, D\u00e1n emigrated to the United States with von Neumann, where he held a professorship at Princeton University. In 1943, von Neumann moved to Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to work on calculations as part of the Manhattan Project. D\u00e1n remained at Princeton until 1946, working at the university's Office of Population Research.[5]\n After the war, D\u00e1n joined von Neumann in New Mexico to program the MANIAC I machine, which could store data, designed by her husband and Julian Bigelow.[6][9][10] She then worked on the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) on a project with von Neumann to produce the first successful meteorological forecast on a computer. D\u00e1n designed new controls for ENIAC and was one of its primary programmers.[11][12] She trained a group of people drawn from the Manhattan Project to store programs as binary code.[5]\n After her husband's death from cancer in 1957, D\u00e1n wrote the preface to his Silliman Lectures. The lectures were published in 1958[13] and later edited and published by Yale University Press as The Computer and the Brain.[14]\n D\u00e1n married oceanographer and physicist Carl Eckart in 1958 and moved to La Jolla, California. She died in 1963 when she drove from her home in La Jolla to the beach and walked into the surf and drowned. The San Diego coroner's office listed her death as a suicide.[4][15]\n This biographical article relating to a computer scientist is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.
