{"name": "Robby Cantarutti", "content": "Robby Cantarutti (born 17 June 1966) is an Italian architect and industrial designer from Venice and the best known practitioner of Italian Rationalism.     \n \nCantarutti's works reflect an individualized and distinctive style. Most are located in Friuli Venezia Giulia, including his Cabin at the River, where he lives with his family. Cantarutti's work was influenced by his passions in life: architecture and nature. Cantarutti considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as wood, clear glass and raw ironwork. He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as natural aging by atmospheric conditions.\n Under the influence of Bauhaus and Le Corbusier, Cantarutti transcended mainstream Rationalism, culminating in an organic style inspired by natural materials. Cantarutti's work enjoys global popularity and continuing admiration and study by architects. His masterpiece, the Cabin at the River was also substance of the film \u201cCabin at the River\u201d directed  by Silvia Zeitlinger and was awarded with the Green LEAF Award 2015 for Best Single House Architecture 2015. It is the most-photographed and filmed private building in Italy. Leading life style companies  like Illy, Knoll use the Cabin as a filming location for their promotion work.\n Cantarutti\u00b4s Industrial Design is distributed by the companies Vibia and Fast all over the world.\n ", "tags": ["International style architects", "Modernist architects", "1966 births", "21st-century Italian architects", "Architectural theoreticians", "Furniture designers", "Italian
