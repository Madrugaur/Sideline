{"name": "Theodor Kaluza", "content": "Theodor Franz Eduard Kaluza (German: [ka\u02c8lu\u02d0t\u0361sa]; 9 November 1885 \u2013 19 January 1954) was a German mathematician and physicist known for the Kaluza\u2013Klein theory, involving field equations in five-dimensional space-time. His idea that fundamental forces can be unified by introducing additional dimensions re-emerged much later in string theory.\n Kaluza was born to a Roman Catholic family from the town of Ratibor (present-day Racib\u00f3rz in Poland) in the German Empire's Prussian Province of Silesia. Kaluza himself was born in Wilhelmsthal (a village that was incorporated into Oppeln (present-day Opole) in 1899). He spent his youth in K\u00f6nigsberg, where his father, Max Kaluza, was a professor of the English language. He entered the University of K\u00f6nigsberg to study mathematics and gained his doctorate with a thesis on Tschirnhaus transformations. Kaluza was primarily a mathematician but began studying relativity. In April 1919 Kaluza noticed that when he solved Albert Einstein's equations for general relativity using five dimensions, then Maxwellian equations for electromagnetism emerged spontaneously.[1][2][3] Kaluza wrote to Einstein who, in turn, encouraged him to publish. Kaluza's theory was published in 1921 in a paper, \"Zum Unit\u00e4tsproblem der Physik\" with Einstein's support in Sitzungsberichte Preu\u00dfische Akademie der Wissenschaften 966\u2013972 (1921).[2]\n Kaluza's insight is remembered as the Kaluza\u2013Klein theory (also named after physicist Oskar Klein).  However, the work was neglected for many years as attention was directed towards quantum mechanics. His idea that fundamental forces can be explained by additional dimensions did not re-emerge until string theory was developed. It is however also notable that many of the aspects of this body of work were already published in 1914 by Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m, but his work also went unnoticed and was not recognized when the ideas re-emerged.\n For the rest of his career Kaluza continued to produce ideas about relativity and about models of the atomic nucleus. Despite Einstein's support, Kaluza remained at a low rank (Privatdozent) at K\u00f6nigsberg until 1929 when he was appointed as professor at the University of Kiel. In 1935 he became a full professor at the University of G\u00f6ttingen where he remained until his death in 1954. Perhaps his finest mathematical work is the textbook H\u00f6here Mathematik f\u00fcr die Praktiker which was written jointly with Georg Joos.\n Kaluza was extraordinarily versatile. He spoke or wrote 17 languages. He also had an unusually modest personality. He refused the Nazi ideology and his appointment to the G\u00f6ttingen chair was possible only with difficulties and by protection of his colleague Helmut Hasse. Strange stories were told of his private life, for example, that he taught himself to swim in his thirties by reading a book and succeeded at his first attempt in the water.\n Kaluza had a son (born 1910), also named Theodor Kaluza\u00a0[de] who was a notable mathematician.\n ", "tags": ["1885 births", "1954 deaths", "20th-century German mathematicians", "German physicists", "People from Opole", "People from the Province of Silesia", "University of K\u00f6nigsberg alumni", "University of Kiel faculty", "University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty", "Theoretical physicists", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Theodor F.
