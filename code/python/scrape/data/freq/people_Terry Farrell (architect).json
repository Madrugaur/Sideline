{"name": "Terry Farrell (architect)", "content": "\n Sir Terry Farrell CBE FRIBA FRSA FCSD MRTPI (born 12 May 1938) is a British architect and urban designer. In 1980, after working for 15 years in partnership with Sir Nicholas Grimshaw, Farrell founded his own firm, Farrells. He garnered a strong reputation for contextual urban design schemes, as well as exuberant works of postmodernism such as the MI6 Building. In 1991, his practice expanded internationally, opening an office in Hong Kong. In Asia his firm designed KK100 in Shenzhen, the tallest building ever designed by a British architect, as well as Guangzhou South railway station, once the largest railway station in Asia.\n At the 2013 invitation of Ed Vaizey, the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, his firm commenced the Farrell Review of Architecture and the Built Environment, intended to offer expert guidance on the direction of British architecture.[1]\n Farrell was born in Sale, Cheshire.[2] His maternal grandfather was born in Manchester to an Irish mother who had emigrated to England from Ireland to escape Great Famine. As a youth he moved to Newcastle upon Tyne, where he attended St. Cuthbert's Grammar School.

In addition, Farrell lectures at a number of different universities including Cambridge University, the University of London, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Sheffield.\n In the early part of his career, Farrell gave emphasis to housing projects.
