{"name": "Andrea Alessi", "content": "Andrea Alessi (Albanian: Andrea Nikoll\u00eb Aleksi, Croatian: Andrija Ale\u0161i, 1425\u20131505) was a Venetian Dalmatian architect and sculptor born in Durazzo (Albania Veneta), considered one of the most distinguished artists of Dalmatia.[1]\n Alessi was born in Durazzo (modern Durr\u00ebs, Albania) in Albania Veneta, and may have been of local Albanian origin rather than Italian.[2] Other sources say he was of Italian origin.[3] He moved to Split in Dalmatia during the Republic of Venice, where he studied under sculptor Mark Troja. He lived most of his life and conducted much of his work in Dalmatia. Alessi was a disciple of Giorgio da Sebenico, and his best-known work is with Niccol\u00f2 di Giovanni Fiorentino on the expansion of the chapel of Blessed John of Trogir in 1468.\nJust like \u0160ibenik Cathedral of St James in Croatia (then part of Venetian Dalmatia), it was composed out of large stone blocks with extreme precision. It is unique harmony of architecture and sculpture according to antique ideals. From inside, there is no flat wall. In the middle of chapel, on the altar, lays the sarcophagus of blessed John of Trogir. Surrounding are reliefs of puttos carrying torches that look like they were peeping out of doors of Underworld. Above them there are niches with sculptures of Christ and apostles (the principle work of Alessi), amongst them are putties, circular windows encircled with fruit garland, and a relief of Nativity. All is ceiled with coffered ceiling with image of God in the middle and 96 portrait heads of angels. With so many faces of smiling children the chapel looks very cheerful and there isn\u2019t nothing similar in European art of that time.\n Andrea is best known for his merchant statues in Ancona, Italy, and his 1454 mural paintings in a church on Arabe island of Dalmatia particularly The Baptistry of Trogir\".\nHe signed the Trogir Baptistery in 1467 with: ANDREAS ALEXIUS DURRACHINUS OPIFEX MCCCCXII (Andreas Alexius, artisan from Durr\u00ebs, 1462).\n He died in Split and is buried in D a Church in Split, Croatia in 1505.\n ", "tags": ["15th-century architects", "15th-century sculptors", "Republic of Venice architects", "Republic of Venice sculptors", "Albanian architects", "Albanian sculptors", "People from Durr\u00ebs", "1425 births", "1505 deaths", "Venetian period in the history of Albania", "Venetian period in the history of Croatia", "Articles containing Albanian-language text", "Articles containing Croatian-language text", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": " Trogir Cathedral entrance detail by Andrea Alessi\nAndrea Alessi (Albanian: Andrea Nikoll\u00eb Aleksi, Croatian: Andrija Ale\u0161i, 1425\u20131505) was a Venetian Dalmatian architect and sculptor born in Durazzo (Albania Veneta), considered one of the most distinguished artists of Dalmatia.[1]\nAlessi was born in Durazzo (modern Durr\u00ebs, Albania) in Albania Veneta, and may have been of local Albanian origin rather than Italian.[2] Other sources say he was of Italian origin.[3] He moved to Split in Dalmatia during the Republic of Venice, where he studied under sculptor Mark Troja.
