{"name": "Julia Kempe", "content": "Julia Kempe is a French, German, and Israeli researcher in quantum computing.[1] She is currently the Director of the Center for Data Science at NYU and Professor at the Courant Institute [2]\n Kempe was born in East Berlin, to a family of Russian descent.[3] She moved to Vienna in 1990 when she was 17,[4] and did her undergraduate studies in mathematics and physics at the University of Vienna from 1992 to 1995, with a year as an exchange student in physics at the University of Technology Sydney. She then earned two Master of Advanced Studies (DEA) degrees in France: one in mathematics in 1996 from Pierre and Marie Curie University and another in 1997 in physics from the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure. She completed two doctorates in 2001. The dissertation for her Ph.D. in computer science from the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications was entitled Quantum Computing: Random Walks and Entanglement, and was supervised by G\u00e9rard Cohen. Her second Ph.D., in mathematics, was from the University of California, Berkeley, with a dissertation entitled Universal Noiseless Quantum Computation: Theory and Applications and was jointly supervised by Elwyn Berlekamp and chemist K. Birgitta Whaley.[5]\n She joined CNRS at the University of Paris-Sud in 2001\n(overlapping with postdoctoral studies at Berkeley and the Berkeley Mathematical Sciences Research Institute), joined the Tel Aviv University faculty in 2007[6], and moved her CNRS position from Paris-Sud to Paris Diderot in 2010.[5].  She became Director of the Center of Data Science at NYU and a Professor at the Courant Institute in September 2018.[2]\n In 2006, Kempe won the bronze medal of CNRS and the Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie Prize of the French government.[3][7] In 2009 she won the Krill Prize of the Wolf Foundation,[8] and in 2010 she won the Troph\u00e9e des femmes en or (English: \"Women in Gold\" trophy\u00a0[fr] ) for her research.[1] In 1998 she received a reward from Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes (English: \"German National Merit Foundation\") which was awarded to only 0.5% of students.[10] She became a knight in the National Order of Merit.[5]  in 2010.
