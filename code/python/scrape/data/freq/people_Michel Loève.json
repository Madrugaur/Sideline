{"name": "Michel Lo\u00e8ve", "content": "Michel Lo\u00e8ve (January 22, 1907 \u2013 February 17, 1979) was a French-American probabilist and mathematical statistician, of Jewish origin.[1] He is known in mathematical statistics and probability theory for the Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve theorem and Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve transform.\n Michel Lo\u00e8ve was born in Jaffa (then part of the Ottoman Empire) in 1907, to a Jewish family. He passed most of his childhood years in Egypt and received his primary and secondary education there in French schools. Later, after achieving the grades of B.L. in 1931 and A.B. in 1936, he studied mathematics at the Universit\u00e9 de Paris under Paul L\u00e9vy, and received his Doctorat \u00e8s Sciences (Math\u00e9matiques) in 1941. In 1936 was employed as actuaire of the University of Lyon.\n Because of his Jewish origin, he was arrested during the German occupation of France and sent to Drancy internment camp. One of his books[2] is dedicated \"To Line and To the students and teachers of the School in the Camp de Drancy\". Having survived the Holocaust, after the liberation he became between 1944 and 1946 chief of research at the Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9 at Paris University, then until 1948 worked at the University of London.\n After one term as a visiting professor at Columbia University he accepted the position of professor of Mathematics at Berkeley, in 1955 adding the title professor of Statistics.\n He is the author of one of the earliest books on measure-theoretic probability theory and one of the best known textbooks.[3]  He is memorialized via the Lo\u00e8ve Prize created by his widow Line.\n ", "tags": ["1907 births", "1979 deaths", "French statisticians", "Probability theorists", "University of Paris alumni", "Academics of the University of London", "Columbia University staff", "University of California, Berkeley College of Letters and Science faculty", "20th-century French mathematicians", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Michel Lo\u00e8veBorn(1907-01-22)January 22, 1907Jaffa, Ottoman SyriaDiedFebruary 17, 1979(1979-02-17) (aged\u00a072)Berkeley, CaliforniaNationalityFrench, AmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ParisKnown\u00a0forKarhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve theoremScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of California, BerkeleyUniversity of Lyon,University of ParisUniversity of LondonDoctoral advisorPaul L\u00e9vyDoctoral studentsLeo BreimanEmanuel ParzenInfluencedPaul-Andre Meyer\n\nMichel Lo\u00e8ve (January 22, 1907 \u2013 February 17, 1979) was a French-American probabilist and mathematical statistician, of Jewish origin.[1] He is known in mathematical statistics and probability theory for the Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve theorem and Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve transform.\nMichel Lo\u00e8ve was born in Jaffa (then part of the Ottoman Empire) in 1907, to a Jewish family.
