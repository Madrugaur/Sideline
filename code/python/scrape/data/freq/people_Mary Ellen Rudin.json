{"name": "Mary Ellen Rudin", "content": "Mary Ellen Rudin (December 7, 1924 \u2013 March 18, 2013)[1] was an American mathematician known for her work in set-theoretic topology.[2] In 2013, Elsevier established the Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award which is awarded annually to a young researcher, mainly in fields adjacent to general topology.[3]\n Mary Ellen (Estill) Rudin was born in Hillsboro, Texas to Joe Jefferson Estill and Irene (Shook) Estill. Her mother Irene was an English teacher before marriage, and her father Joe was a civil engineer.  The family moved with her father's work, but spent a great deal of Mary Ellen's childhood around Leakey, Texas.[4] She had one sibling, a younger brother.  Both of Rudin's maternal grandmothers had attended Mary Sharp College near their hometown of Winchester, Tennessee.  Rudin remarks on this legacy and how much her family valued education in an interview.[4]\n She attended the University of Texas, completing her B.A. in 1944 after just three years before moving into the graduate program in mathematics under Robert Lee Moore.[5] Her graduate thesis presented a counterexample to one of \"Moore's axioms\". She completed her Ph.D. in 1949.\n During her time as an undergraduate, she was a member of the Phi Mu Women's Fraternity,[6]   and was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa society.[7]\n In 1953, she married mathematician Walter Rudin, whom she met while teaching at Duke University. They had four children.\n At the beginning of her career, Rudin taught at Duke University and the University of Rochester.[8] She took a position as Lecturer at the University of Wisconsin in 1959, and was appointed Professor of Mathematics in 1971.  After her retirement in 1991, she continued to serve as a Professor Emerita. She was the first Grace Chisholm Young Professor of Mathematics and also held the Hilidale Professorship,.[4][8]\n She was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1974 in Vancouver.[9] She served as vice-president of the American Mathematical Society, 1980\u20131981.  In 1984 she was selected to be a Noether Lecturer. She was an honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1995). In 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[10]\n Rudin is best known in topology for her constructions of counterexamples to well-known conjectures.  In 1958, she found an unshellable triangulation of the tetrahedron.[11] Most famously, Rudin was the first to construct a Dowker space,[12] which she did in 1971, thus disproving a conjecture of Clifford Hugh Dowker that had stood, and helped drive topological research, for more than twenty years. Her example fueled the search for \"small\" ZFC Dowker spaces.  She also proved the first Morita conjecture and a restricted version of the second.[13] Her last major result was a proof of Nikiel's conjecture.[14] Early proofs that every metric space is paracompact were somewhat involved, but Rudin provided an elementary one.[15]\n \"Reading the articles of Mary Ellen Rudin, studying them until there is no mystery takes hours and hours; but those hours are rewarded, the student obtains power to which few have access. They are not hard to read, they are just hard mathematics, that's all.\" (Steve Watson[16])\n Rudin resided in Madison, Wisconsin, in the Rudin House, a home designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright.\n The Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award is an annual award given to young researchers in General Topology and its related fields. [17] It was established in 2013 by Elsevier on behalf of the journal Topology and its Applications and consists on $15,000 USD that must be used by the awardee in the following way: $5,000 USD for three major conferences in topology, $5,000 USD for visiting a research center, and $5,000 USD which can be used freely and is regarded as a cash prize.\n The prize was named after Mary Ellen Rudin, one of the most prominent topologists in the 20th century. Mary Ellen gave her permission to use her name for the award but unfortunately passed away before the first prize was awarded.[18] [19]\n ", "tags": ["1924 births", "2013 deaths", "University of Texas at Austin College of Natural Sciences alumni", "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison faculty", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "American women mathematicians", "Topologists", "20th-century American women scientists", "Mathematicians from Texas", "People from Hillsboro, Texas", "People from Real County, Texas", "People from Madison, Wisconsin", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Mathematics awards", "International awards", "Academic awards", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from January 2018", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 maint: date format", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Official website not in Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nMary Ellen RudinBornMary Ellen Estill(1924-12-07)December 7, 1924Hillsboro, TexasDiedMarch 18, 2013(2013-03-18) (aged\u00a088)NationalityAmericanSpouse(s)Walter RudinAwardsNoether LecturerAcademic backgroundAlma materUniversity of Texas at Austin, ThesisConcerning Abstract Spaces\u00a0(1949)Doctoral advisorRobert Lee MooreAcademic workDisciplineMathematicsSub-disciplineSet-theoretic topologyInstitutionsDuke University,  University of Rochester,  University of Wisconsin at Madison\n\nMary Ellen Rudin (December 7, 1924 \u2013 March 18, 2013)[1] was an American mathematician known for her work in set-theoretic topology.[2] In 2013, Elsevier established the Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award which is awarded annually to a young researcher, mainly in fields adjacent to general topology.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Later life\n4 See also\n5 Publications\n6 Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award\n\n6.1 List of awardees\n\n\n7 External links\n8 References\n9 Further reading\n10 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nMary Ellen (Estill) Rudin was born in Hillsboro, Texas to Joe Jefferson Estill and Irene (Shook) Estill.
