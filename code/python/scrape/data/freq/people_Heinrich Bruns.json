{"name": "Heinrich Bruns", "content": "Ernst Heinrich Bruns (4 September 1848 \u2013 23 September 1919) was a German mathematician and astronomer, who also contributed to the development of the field of theoretical geodesy.\n Heinrich Bruns was born on 4 September 1848 in Berlin to Christian Gerhard Bruns, a landscape painter, and his wife, Caroline Henriette Hasse.\n Bruns studied mathematics, astronomy, and physics at the University of Berlin during 1866\u20131871 under Ernst Kummer and Karl Weierstrass and earned a doctoral degree with a dissertation titled De proprietate quadam functionis potentialis corporum homogeneorum (\"On the properties of a certain potential function of homogeneous bodies\").  From 1872 to 1873 he was employed at the Pulkowa Observatory in Russia as a calculator. There he met and married Marie Wilhelmine Schleussner, who also worked as a calculator at the observatory. In 1873 he became an observer at the Observatory of Dorpat (now Tartu) in Estonia, where he remained until 1876. During this time he also worked as a lecturer at the University of Dorpat.\n In 1876, Bruns was appointed an associate professor of mathematics at the University of Berlin. He also worked at the Prussian Military Academy and the Geodetic Institute of Potsdam. In 1882 he went to Saxony as a full professor of astronomy at the University of Leipzig and director of the Leipzig Observatory. That same year, he was elected a member of the academy of science Leopoldina.\n Heinrich Bruns was mainly engaged in developing the theoretical side of \"the shape of the Earth\" (the title of one of his major works). The fields of potential theory and the study of equilibrium shapes owe many key results to him, including Bruns formula.\n For the study of astronomical refraction he developed an unusual method of calculating the vertical gradient of air temperature together with his Assistant Felix Hausdorff. However, due to a lack of sufficiently accurate measurement methods this method has not been used in practice.\n The 20th century's higher geodesy (a sub-field of geodesy concerned with measuring the earth on a global scale) as practiced by Karl Ledersteger was based on theories developed by Bruns, including \"Bruns' polyhedron\". This construct was envisioned as a world-spanning net. Satellite geodesy turned this thought experiment into a reality with the development of the GPS.\n ", "tags": ["1848 births", "1919 deaths", "19th-century German mathematicians", "Scientists from Berlin", "German astronomers", "Humboldt University of Berlin alumni", "Leipzig University faculty", "Humboldt University of Berlin faculty", "20th-century German mathematicians", "German geodesists", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Heinrich BrunsBorn(1848-09-04)4 September 1848Berlin, GermanyDied23 September 1919(1919-09-23) (aged\u00a071)Leipzig, GermanyNationalityGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of BerlinKnown\u00a0forContributions to the field of geodesySpouse(s)Marie Wilhelmine SchleussnerScientific careerFieldsGeodesy  Potential theory  Equilibrium shapesInstitutionsPulkowa Observatory  Observatory of Dorpat  University of Dorpat  University of Berlin  Prussian Military Academy  Geodetic Institute of Potsdam  University of Leipzig  Leipzig ObservatoryThesisDe proprietate quadam functionis potentialis corporum homogeneorum (\"On the properties of a certain potential function of homogeneous bodies\")\u00a0(1871)Doctoral advisorErnst Kummer  Karl WeierstrassDoctoral studentsJohannes Franz HartmannFelix Hausdorff\n\nErnst Heinrich Bruns (4 September 1848 \u2013 23 September 1919) was a German mathematician and astronomer, who also contributed to the development of the field of theoretical geodesy.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Education and professional appointments\n3 Work\n4 Publications\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nHeinrich Bruns was born on 4 September 1848 in Berlin to Christian Gerhard Bruns, a landscape painter, and his wife, Caroline Henriette Hasse.\n\nEducation and professional appointments[edit]\nBruns studied mathematics, astronomy, and physics at the University of Berlin during 1866\u20131871 under Ernst Kummer and Karl Weierstrass and earned a doctoral degree with a dissertation titled De proprietate quadam functionis potentialis corporum homogeneorum (\"On the properties of a certain potential function of homogeneous bodies\").
