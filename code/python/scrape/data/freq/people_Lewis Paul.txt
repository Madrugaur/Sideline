{"name": "Lewis Paul", "content": "\n Lewis Paul (died 1759) was the original inventor of roller spinning, the basis of the water frame for spinning cotton in a cotton mill.\n Lewis Paul was of Huguenot descent. His father was physician to Lord Shaftesbury.  He may have begun work on designing a spinning machine for cotton as early as 1729, but probably did not make practical progress until after 1732 when he met John Wyatt, a carpenter then working in Birmingham for a gun barrel forger.  Wyatt had designed a machine, probably for cutting files, in which Paul took an interest.\n Roller spinning was certainly Paul's idea, and Wyatt built a machine (or model) for him.  Paul obtained a patent for this on 24 June 1738.  He then set about trying to license his machine, though some licences were granted in satisfaction of debts.  In 1741, he set up a machine powered by two asses in the Upper Priory in Birmingham, near his house in Old Square.\n Edward Cave, a publisher, obtained a licence and set up machines in a warehouse in London. In 1742, he acquired Marvel's Mill on the River Nene at Northampton. He rebuilt the mill to hold four or five water-powered spinning machines, each with 50 spindles.  This was thus the first cotton mill.  Cave died on 10 January 1754, so that the mill passed to his brother William and his nephew Paul.
