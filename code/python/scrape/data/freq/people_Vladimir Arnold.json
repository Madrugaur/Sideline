{"name": "Vladimir Arnold", "content": "\n Vladimir Igorevich Arnold (alternative spelling Arnol'd, Russian: \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0301\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0418\u0301\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0410\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0434, 12 June 1937 \u2013 3 June 2010)[3][4][1] was a Soviet and Russian mathematician. While he is best known for the Kolmogorov\u2013Arnold\u2013Moser theorem regarding the stability of integrable systems, he made important contributions in several areas including dynamical systems theory, algebra, catastrophe theory, topology, algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, differential equations, classical mechanics, hydrodynamics and singularity theory, including posing the ADE classification problem, since his first main result\u2014the solution of Hilbert's thirteenth problem in 1957 at the age of 19. He co-founded two new branches of mathematics\u2014KAM theory, and topological Galois theory (this, with his student Askold Khovanskii).\n Arnold was also known as a popularizer of mathematics. Through his lectures, seminars, and as the author of several textbooks (such as the famous Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics) and popular mathematics books, he influenced many mathematicians and physicists.[5][6] Many of his books were translated into English. His views on education were particularly opposed to those of Bourbaki.\n Vladimir Igorevich Arnold was born on 12 June 1937 in Odessa, Soviet Union. His father was Igor Vladimirovich Arnold (1900\u20131948), a mathematician. His mother was Nina Alexandrovna Arnold (1909\u20131986, n\u00e9e Isakovich), a Jewish art historian.[4] When Arnold was thirteen, an uncle who was an engineer told him about calculus and how it could be used to understand some physical phenomena, this contributed to spark his interest for mathematics, and he started to study by himself the mathematical books his father had left to him, which included some works of Leonhard Euler and Charles Hermite.[7]\n While a student of Andrey Kolmogorov at Moscow State University and still a teenager, Arnold showed in 1957 that any continuous function of several variables can be constructed with a finite number of two-variable functions, thereby solving Hilbert's thirteenth problem.[8] This is the Kolmogorov\u2013Arnold representation theorem.\n After graduating from Moscow State University in 1959, he worked there until 1986 (a professor since 1965), and then at Steklov Mathematical Institute.\n He became an academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (Russian Academy of Science since 1991) in 1990.[9] Arnold can be said to have initiated the theory of symplectic topology as a distinct discipline. The Arnold conjecture on the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms and Lagrangian intersections were also a major motivation in the development of Floer homology.\n In 1999 he suffered a serious bike accident in Paris, resulting in traumatic brain injury, and though he regained consciousness after a few weeks, he had amnesia and for some time could not even recognize his own wife at the hospital,[10] but he went on to make a good recovery.[11]\n Arnold worked at the Steklov Mathematical Institute in Moscow and at Paris Dauphine University up until his death. As of 2006[update] he was reported to have the highest citation index among Russian scientists,[12] and h-index of 40.\n To his students and colleagues Arnold was known also for his sense of humour. For example, once at his seminar in Moscow, at the beginning of the school year, when he usually was formulating new problems, he said:\n There is a general principle that a stupid man can ask such questions to which one hundred wise men would not be able to answer. In accordance with this principle I shall formulate some problems.[13] Arnold died of acute pancreatitis[14] on 3 June 2010 in Paris, nine days before his 73rd birthday.[15] His students include Alexander Givental, Victor Goryunov, Sabir Gusein-Zade, Emil Horozov, Boris Khesin, Askold Khovanskii, Nikolay Nekhoroshev, Boris Shapiro, Alexander Varchenko, Victor Vassiliev and Vladimir Zakalyukin.[2]\n He was buried on 15 June in Moscow, at the Novodevichy Monastery.[16]\n In a telegram to Arnold's family, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stated:\n The death of Vladimir Arnold, one of the greatest mathematicians of our time, is an irretrievable loss for world science. It is difficult to overestimate the contribution made by academician Arnold to modern mathematics and the prestige of Russian science.\n Teaching had a special place in Vladimir Arnold's life and he had great influence as an enlightened mentor who taught several generations of talented scientists.\n \nThe memory of Vladimir Arnold will forever remain in the hearts of his colleagues, friends and students, as well as everyone who knew and admired this brilliant man.[17] Arnold is well known for his lucid writing style, combining mathematical rigour with physical intuition, and an easy conversational style of teaching and education. His writings present a fresh, often geometric approach to traditional mathematical topics like ordinary differential equations, and his many textbooks have proved influential in the development of new areas of mathematics. The standard criticism about Arnold's pedagogy is that his books \"are beautiful treatments of their subjects that are appreciated by experts, but too many details are omitted for students to learn the mathematics required to prove the statements that he so effortlessly justifies.\" His defense is that his books are meant to teach the subject to \"those who truly wish to understand it\" (Chicone, 2007).[18]\n Arnold was an outspoken critic of the trend towards high levels of abstraction in mathematics during the middle of the last century. He had very strong opinions on how this approach\u2014which was most popularly implemented by the Bourbaki school in France\u2014initially had a negative impact on French mathematical education, and then later on that of other countries as well.[19][20] Arnold was very interested in the history of mathematics.[21] In an interview,[20] he said he had learned much of what he knew about mathematics through the study of Felix Klein's book Development of Mathematics in the 19th Century \u2014a book he often recommended to his students.[22] He liked to study the classics, most notably the works of Huygens, Newton and Poincar\u00e9,[23] and many times he reported to have found in their works ideas that had not been explored yet.[24]\n Arnold worked on dynamical systems theory, catastrophe theory, topology, algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, differential equations, classical mechanics, hydrodynamics and singularity theory.[5]\n The problem is the following question: can every continuous function of three variables be expressed as a composition of finitely many continuous functions of two variables?  The affirmative answer to this general question was given in 1957 by Vladimir Arnold, then only nineteen years old and a student of Andrey Kolmogorov. Kolmogorov had shown in the previous year that any function of several variables can be constructed with a finite number of three-variable functions. Arnold then expanded on this work to show that only two-variable functions were in fact required, thus answering the Hilbert's question when posed for the class of continuous functions.\n Moser and Arnold expanded the ideas of Kolmogorov (who was inspired by questions of Poincar\u00e9) and gave rise to what is now known as Kolmogorov\u2013Arnold\u2013Moser theorem (or \"KAM theory\"), which concerns the persistence of some quasi-periodic motions (nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems) when they are perturbed. KAM theory shows that, despite the perturbations, such systems can be stable over an infinite period of time, and specifies what the conditions for this are.[25]\n In 1965, Arnold attended Ren\u00e9 Thom's seminar on catastrophe theory. He later said of it: \"I am deeply indebted to Thom, whose singularity seminar at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques, which I frequented throughout the year 1965, profoundly changed my mathematical universe.\"[26] After this event, singularity theory became one of the major interests of Arnold and his students.[27] Among his most famous results in this area is his classification of simple singularities, contained in his paper \"Normal forms of functions near degenerate critical points, the Weyl groups of Ak,Dk,Ek and Lagrangian singularities\".[28][29][30]\n In 1966, Arnold published \"Sur la g\u00e9om\u00e9trie diff\u00e9rentielle des groupes de Lie de dimension infinie et ses applications \u00e0 l'hydrodynamique des fluides parfaits\", in which he presented a common geometric interpretation for both the Euler's equations for rotating rigid bodies and the Euler's equations of fluid dynamics, this effectively linked topics previously thought to be unrelated, and enabled mathematical solutions to many questions related to fluid flows and their turbulence.[31][32][33]\n In the year 1971, Arnold published \"On the arrangement of ovals of real plane algebraic curves, involutions of four-dimensional smooth manifolds, and the arithmetic of integral quadratic forms\",[34] which gave new life to real algebraic geometry. In it, he made major advances in the direction of a solution to Gudkov's conjecture, by finding a connection between it and four-dimensional topology.[35] The conjecture was to be later fully solved by V. A. Rokhlin building on Arnold's work.[36][37]\n The Arnold conjecture, linking the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms and the topology of the subjacent manifolds, was the motivating source of many of the pioneer studies in symplectic topology.[38][39]\n According to Victor Vassiliev, Arnold \"worked comparatively little on topology for topology's sake.\" And he was rather motivated by problems on other areas of mathematics where topology could be of use. His contributions include the invention of a topological form of the Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem and the initial development of some of the consequent ideas, a work which resulted in the creation of the field of topological Galois theory in the 1960s.[40][41]\n Arnold revolutionized plane curves theory.[42]\n Arnold conjectured the existence of the g\u00f6mb\u00f6c.[43]\n The minor planet 10031 Vladarnolda was named after him in 1981 by Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina.[51]\n The Arnold Mathematical Journal, published for the first time in 2015, is named after him.[52]\n He was a plenary speaker at both the 1974 and 1983 International Congress of Mathematicians in Vancouver and Warsaw, respectively.[53]\n Even though Arnold was nominated for the 1974 Fields Medal, which was then viewed as the highest honour a mathematician could receive, interference from the Soviet government led to it being withdrawn. Arnold's public opposition to the persecution of dissidents had led him into direct conflict with influential Soviet officials, and he suffered persecution himself, including not being allowed to leave the Soviet Union during most of the 1970s and 1980s.[54][55]\n ", "tags": ["1937 births", "2010 deaths", "Scientists from Odessa", "20th-century Russian mathematicians", "21st-century Russian mathematicians", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Lenin Prize winners", "Mathematical analysts", "Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Full Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Moscow State University alumni", "Soviet mathematicians", "State Prize of the Russian Federation laureates", "Topologists", "Fluid dynamicists", "University of Paris faculty", "Wolf Prize in Mathematics laureates", "Mathematical physicists", "Textbook writers", "Geometers", "Algebraic geometers", "Differential geometers", "Dynamical systems theorists", "Newton scholars", "Deaths from pancreatitis", "Moscow State University faculty", "Steklov Institute of Mathematics faculty", "Members of the American Philosophical Society", "Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin", "Algebraists", "Odessa Jews", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from March 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2006", "All articles containing potentially dated statements", "Articles containing French-language text", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Russian mathematician\n\n\nVladimir ArnoldVladimir Arnold in 2008Born(1937-06-12)12 June 1937Odessa, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet UnionDied3 June 2010(2010-06-03) (aged\u00a072)Paris, FranceNationalitySoviet Union, RussianAlma\u00a0materMoscow State UniversityKnown\u00a0forADE classificationArnold's cat mapArnold conjectureArnold diffusionArnold's rouble problemArnold's spectral sequenceArnold tongueABC flowArnold\u2013Givental conjectureG\u00f6mb\u00f6cGudkov's conjectureHilbert's thirteenth problemKAM theoremKolmogorov\u2013Arnold theoremLiouville\u2013Arnold theoremTopological Galois theoryMathematical Methods of Classical MechanicsAwardsShaw Prize (2008)  State Prize of the Russian Federation (2007)  Wolf Prize (2001)  Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics (2001)  Harvey Prize (1994)  RAS Lobachevsky Prize (1992)  Crafoord Prize (1982)  Lenin Prize (1965)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsParis Dauphine UniversitySteklov Institute of MathematicsIndependent University of MoscowMoscow State UniversityDoctoral advisorAndrey KolmogorovDoctoral students\nAlexander Givental\nVictor Goryunov\nSabir Gusein-Zade\nEmil Horozov\nBoris Khesin[1]\nAskold Khovanskii\nNikolay Nekhoroshev\nBoris Shapiro\nAlexander Varchenko\nVictor Vassiliev\nVladimir Zakalyukin[2]\n\n\nVladimir Igorevich Arnold (alternative spelling Arnol'd, Russian: \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0301\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0418\u0301\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0410\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0434, 12 June 1937 \u2013 3 June 2010)[3][4][1] was a Soviet and Russian mathematician.
