{"name": "James Walker (engineer)", "content": "\n James Walker FRSE FRS FRSA  (14 September 1781 \u2013 8 October 1862) was an influential Scottish civil engineer.\n Born in Law Wynd in Falkirk, the eldest of five children of John Walker and his wife Margaret, James was educated at the local school and was sent to Glasgow University in October 1794, aged 13. He studied Latin and Greek for two years, and logic during his third year. During his final two years he studied natural philosophy and mathematics, taking the first prize.\n He returned to Falkirk in May 1799, aged 18, and his family discussed a career in business or law. But, by chance, in the summer of 1800, he was asked to accompany his ill brother-in-law on a sea journey to London. Once there, he visited his uncle Ralph Walker in Blackwall, intending to return to Scotland after a week. However, Ralph discussed his work at the West India Docks, and was so impressed by his young nephew's grasp of engineering that he immediately took him on as his apprentice.\n Around 1800 they worked on the design and construction of London's West India and East India Docks. At the age of 21 he took on his first engineering work in his own right: the construction of Commercial Road in London, connecting the West India Docks to the warehouses of the City. Later, he worked on the Surrey Commercial Docks from about 1810 onwards, remaining as engineer to the Surrey Commercial Dock Company until his death in 1862.\n In 1821 Walker built his first lighthouse, the West Usk Lighthouse, near Newport, South Wales.[1][2] He went on to build another 21 lighthouses.\n Walker was the senior partner of the consulting engineering firm of Messrs. Walker and Burges[3] (of Limehouse), Burges having first became his pupil in 1811 and risen to partner in 1829.[3] In 1832 their offices moved to 44 Parliament Street, Westminster (which lies at southern end of Whitehall) and then to 23 George Street.[3] In 1853 he promoted James Cooper,[4] one of his assistants, to the partnership with the firm then being known as Messrs. Walker, Burges & Cooper.[5][6][7]\n Walker succeeded his associate Thomas Telford as President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, serving from 1834 to 1845.[8][9] One of his first major roles as President was to oversee the choice of three new harbours to serve Edinburgh: a major extension to Leith Docks; a new harbour at Trinity; or a new harbour at Granton. The choice resulted in the building of Granton Harbour.[10]\n He was also chief engineer within Trinity House, hence his considerable involvement with coastal engineering and lighthouses. He was conferred with Honorary Membership of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland in 1857.[11]\n He died at 23 Great George Street in Westminster, London on 8 October 1862.\n He is buried beneath a humble gravestone in St Johns churchyard in Edinburgh against a retaining wall on one of the southern terraces.\n Walker worked on various engineering projects, including:\n Walker was also involved in designing a dock harbour in Hamburg (1845, with William Lindley and Heinrich H\u00fcbbe). He was also involved in the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, preparing a report on the merits of stationary and locomotive engines along with other notable engineers of the day.[33]  He was also for a long period consulting engineer to the Board of Admiralty.[34]\n A memorial to Walker was commissioned by the Institution of Civil Engineers to stand at Greenland Dock and was unveiled in 1990.[35]\n \n ", "tags": ["Scottish civil engineers", "19th-century British engineers", "Lighthouse builders", "People from Falkirk", "1781 births", "1862 deaths", "Presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers", "Presidents of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers", "Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh", "Alumni of the University of Glasgow", "Burials at St John's, Edinburgh", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts", "CS1: long volume value", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "CS1 maint: location", "EngvarB from August 2014", "Use dmy dates from August 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nJames WalkerJames WalkerBorn14 September 1781Falkirk, ScotlandDied8 October 1862(1862-10-08) (aged\u00a081)NationalityScottishCitizenshipUnited KingdomEducationUniversity of GlasgowOccupationEngineerEngineering careerDisciplinecivil engineeringInstitutionsInstitution of Civil Engineers (president), Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Fellow of the Royal Society of LondonPractice nameWalker & Burges\n\n James Walker's grave, St Johns, Edinburgh\nJames Walker FRSE FRS FRSA  (14 September 1781 \u2013 8 October 1862) was an influential Scottish civil engineer.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Projects and other work\n3 Memorial\n4 References\n\n4.1 Obituaries\n\n\n\n\nLife[edit]\nBorn in Law Wynd in Falkirk, the eldest of five children of John Walker and his wife Margaret, James was educated at the local school and was sent to Glasgow University in October 1794, aged 13.
