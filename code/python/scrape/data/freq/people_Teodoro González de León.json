During this time, he was involved mainly on the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation project by Le Corbusier in Marseille and on the St Di\u00e9 factory project.[3]\n Still as student, he conceived the original concept and idea for the campus \"Ciudad Universitaria\" of the U.N.A.M., the main university in Mexico and that essence was developed by his own teachers and the great architects of the time.
