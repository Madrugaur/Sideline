She completed her doctorate in 1964 from the University College of Wales; her dissertation concerned fluid mechanics.[1][3][4] She stayed on for a year in Wales as an assistant lecturer;[1]\nshe was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Victoria in 1965, and retired in 2006.[4][5]\n In mathematical biology, van den Driessche's contributions include important work on delay differential equations and on Hopf bifurcations,[1][4] and the effects of changing population size and immigration on epidemics.[3]\n She has also done more fundamental research in linear algebra, motivated by applications in mathematical biology.[3] Her work in this area includes pioneering contributions to the theory of combinatorial matrix theory in which she proved connections between the sign pattern of a matrix and its stability,[1][3][4] as well as results on matrix decomposition.[3]\n In 2005, the journal Linear Algebra and its Applications published a special issue in her honor.[1][5] She was the 2007 winner of the Krieger\u2013Nelson Prize of the Canadian Mathematical Society,[3] and in the same year became the inaugural Olga Taussky-Todd Lecturer, an award given every four years at the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics by the International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and Association for Women in Mathematics.[4]\nIn 2013 she became a fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics \"for contributions to linear algebra and mathematical biology\".[6] In 2019, she received the CAIMS Research Prize from the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society.[7]\n ", "tags": ["1941 births", "Living people", "British computer scientists", "British women computer scientists", "British mathematicians", "Canadian computer scientists", "Canadian women computer scientists", "British women mathematicians", "Canadian women mathematicians", "20th-century British mathematicians", "21st-century British mathematicians", "20th-century Canadian mathematicians", "21st-century Canadian mathematicians", "Alumni of Imperial College London", "Alumni of Aberystwyth University", "Academics of Aberystwyth University", "University of Victoria faculty", "Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from March 2018", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from April 2018", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "British and Canadian applied mathematician\n\n\nPauline van den DriesscheBorn1941 (age\u00a079\u201380)NationalityBritish-CanadianAwardsKrieger\u2013Nelson Prize Academic backgroundEducationImperial College LondonAlma materUniversity College of WalesAcademic workDisciplineApplied mathematicsSub-disciplineMathematical biologyInstitutionsUniversity of Victoria\n\nPauline van den Driessche (born 1941)[1] is a British and Canadian applied mathematician who is a professor emerita in the department of mathematics and statistics at the University of Victoria,[2] where she has also held an affiliation in the department of computer science.[3] Her research interests include mathematical biology, matrix analysis, and stability theory.\n\nContents\n\n1 Education and career\n2 Contributions\n3 Awards and honors\n4 References\n\n\nEducation and career[edit]\nVan den Driessche earned bachelor's and master's degrees in 1961 and 1963 respectively from Imperial College London.
