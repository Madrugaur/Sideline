{"name": "Henri Giffard", "content": "\n Baptiste Jules Henri Jacques Giffard (8 February 1825\u00a0\u2013 14 April 1882) was a French engineer. In 1852 he invented the steam injector and the powered Giffard dirigible airship.\n Giffard was born in Paris in 1825. He invented the injector and the Giffard dirigible, an airship powered with a steam engine and weighing over 180\u00a0kg (400\u00a0lb). It was the world's first passenger-carrying airship (then known as a dirigible, from French).[2] Both practical and steerable, the hydrogen-filled airship was equipped with a 3\u00a0hp steam engine that drove a propeller. The engine was fitted with a downward-pointing funnel. The exhaust steam was mixed in with the combustion gases and it was hoped by these means to stop sparks rising up to the gas bag; he also installed a vertical rudder.[citation needed]\n On 24 September 1852, Giffard made the first powered and controlled flight travelling 27\u00a0km from Paris to \u00c9lancourt.[3] The wind was too strong to allow him to make way against it, so he was unable to return to the start.[3] However, he was able to make turns and circles,[citation needed] proving that a powered airship could be steered and controlled.[4]\n Giffard was granted a patent for the injector on 8 May 1858. Unusually, he had thoroughly worked out the theory of this invention before making any experimental instrument, having explained the idea in 1850. Others had worked on using jets, particularly Eug\u00e8ne Bourdon who patented a very similar device in 1857.[5]\n In 1863, he was appointed a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.[6]\n In response to his declining eyesight, Giffard committed suicide in 1882,[6] leaving his estate to the nation for humanitarian and scientific purposes.[7]\n Balloon of Henri Giffard over Paris rooftops, 1878.[8][9]\n A model of the Giffard Airship at the London Science Museum.\n Medal of Giffard's balloon over Paris in 1878.[8]\n ", "tags": ["1825 births", "1882 deaths", "People from Paris", "Burials at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery", "French mechanical engineers", "French balloonists", "Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Airship aviators", "Airship designers", "Steam-powered aircraft", "1880s suicides", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from January 2020", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from August 2020", "Articles with unsourced statements from May 2009", "CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list", "Commons link from Wikidata", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French airship and steam injector engineer\n\n\nHenri GiffardBornBaptiste Jules Henri Jacques Giffard(1825-02-08)8 February 1825Paris, FranceDied14 April 1882(1882-04-14) (aged\u00a057)[1]NationalityFrenchOccupationengineerKnown\u00a0forsteam injector, Giffard dirigible airship\n The Giffard dirigible, created by Giffard in 1852\n A- Steam from boiler, B- Needle valve, C- Needle valve handle, D- Steam and water combine, E-Water feed, F- Combining cone, G- Delivery nozzle and cone, H- delivery chamber and pipe, K- Check valve\nBaptiste Jules Henri Jacques Giffard (8 February 1825\u00a0\u2013 14 April 1882) was a French engineer.
