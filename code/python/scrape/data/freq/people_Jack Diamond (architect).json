{"name": "Jack Diamond (architect)", "content": "Abel Joseph \"Jack\" Diamond, OC OOnt (Born November 8th, 1932) is a Canadian architect from Pier Retief, South Africa. Diamond arrived in Canada in 1964 for the University of Toronto. In 1974, he established his architectural practice, A.J Diamond Architects. In 1978, Diamond merged with Donald Schmitt and Company. Their practice evolved into Diamond Schmitt Architects. [1]\n Jack Diamond was born on November 8th, 1932 in Piet Retief, South Africa,[1] and belongs to a Jewish  Family.[2] Diamond's great-grandfather was a rabbi in London, England. In 1917, Diamond's grandfather died in a pogrom in Lithuania. Diamond's father, Jacob Diamond, migrated to South Africa before the Second World War. [2]\n Diamond's mother had kept a house plan Diamond drew when he was four. His love for architecture begun at a young age. To Diamond, buildings have been always unique way of playing house. Diamond has a passion for various forms of art; painting, sketching, and music. [3]\n Diamond has a love for watercolor paintings and sketches. His house is decorated with cities and landscapes paintings from throughout his career. His sketches are published in a book by Douglas & McIntyre, called Sketched:From Here and There. The book consists of many sketches that resembles his very own sketch book. [4]\n In 1956, Jack Diamond received a Bachelor of Architecture from University of Cape Town. He subsequently studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at University College, Oxford, graduating in 1958. Diamond received his Masters of Architecture at University of Pennsylvania  in 1962.[1][5] It was at the University of Pennsylvania where Diamond met his wife, Gillian.[6] In Philadelphia, Diamond worked with the reputable architect, Louis Kahn.[7] In 1964, Diamond emigrated to Canada and became the director of the Architecture Program at University of Toronto.[1]\n In 1995, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada[8][9] and was awarded the Order of Ontario [10][9] in 1997.\n He has served as a member of the Ontario Human Rights Commission from 1986 to 1989, as Chairman of the Design Advisory Committee for the National Capital, Ottawa and as a Commissioner of the Greater Toronto Area Task Force.[1]\n Diamond begun his career in architecture in 1968, [11] shortly after he joined University of Toronto[1] He stayed with the University of Toronto until 1970.\n In 1970, Diamond persuaded people in Toronto to consider heritage preservation of an old ceramics manufacturing plant. At the time, the idea of preserving an old warehouse was a bizarre concept. Diamond had borrowed money and renovated the building and live in one of the floors. The project was successful and other individuals showed interest. The old warehouse went under renovation and is later sold to Ed Mirvish. Diamond is a known pioneer in Toronto's heritage restoration. [12]\n In 1975, Diamond established his practice A.J Diamond Architects. In 1978, he forms a partnership with Donald Schmitt and Company and the practice evolved into Diamond and Schmitt Architects  employing over 120 [13] staff. Diamond Schmitt Architects have designed academic, cultural, commercial, healthcare, civic and residential buildings [14] Their approach to architecture revolves around human activity. They challenge design in hopes of creating spaces that create a better way of living by using creative design strategies. [15]\n [16]\n The Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts opened in 2006. It is home to the Canadian Opera Company and the National Ballet of Canada. The Performing Arts Centre design keeps the city noise of Toronto out.[17]\n The United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial was an international design competition held in 2017. Diamond Schmitt's entry was among the finalists, although it was ultimately not selected. Located in Victoria Tower Gardens, the entrance of the Memorial is a ramp that circles around the middle. The cast-iron walls are a darker material are a reminder of the events that took place in the Holocaust. The sunken middle opens up to the sky to bring lightness into the memorial and contrast to the darker walls. The middle of the Memorial is the 'Court of Conscience'. The names of the victims are the only sounds heard within the quiet memorial.[18]\n The Marinsky II opened in 2013 in St. Petersburg, Russia. This theater was one of the first major Russia opera houses to be constructed in over a century. Acoustic quality and the experience of a performance were two main goals when designing the Mariinsky II. The main auditorium of the theater is clad in Onyx. The warm glow from the Onyx can be seen at street level outside. The warm glow is considered to be the artistic spirit from art institutions in Russia.[19] The backstage is designed to allow for 5 stages to be worked on simultaneously, making it easier for crews working on productions. The theater is a symbolism of the power art has within Russia  [20]\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n ", "tags": ["1932 births", "Living people", "People from Piet Retief, Mpumalanga", "Canadian architects", "Canadian Jews", "Officers of the Order of Canada", "Members of the Order of Ontario", "University of Cape Town alumni", "Architects of YMCA buildings", "Alumni of the University of Oxford", "Alumni of University College, Oxford", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "BLP articles lacking sources from May 2009", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Canadian architect\nFor other people with the same name, see Jack Diamond.\nThis biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.
