In 1962 he received B.A. from Yeshiva University and M.A. from the Graduate School of Science, Yeshiva University. In 1965, he received his Ph.D. from Princeton under the supervision of William Feller.[1]\n Between 1965 and 1967, Weiss worked at the IBM Research. In 1967, he joined the faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem; and since 1990 occupied the Miriam and Julius Vinik Chair in Mathematics (Emeritus since 2009). Weiss held visiting positions at Stanford, MSRI, and IBM Research Center.\n Weiss published over 180 papers in ergodic theory, topological dynamics, orbit equivalence, probability, information theory, game theory, descriptive set theory; with notable contributions including introduction of Markov partitions (with Roy Adler), development of ergodic theory of amenable groups (with Don Ornstein), mean dimension (with Elon Lindenstrauss), introduction of sofic subshifts and sofic groups. The road coloring conjecture was also posed by Weiss with Roy Adler.\n One of Weiss's students is Elon Lindenstrauss, a 2010 recipient of the Fields Medal.\n Weiss gave an invited address at the International Congress of Mathematicians 1974, \nwas twice the main speaker at a Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences (1979 and 1995),\ngave the M.B.Porter Distinguished Lecture Series at Rice University (1998).\nIn 2000 Weiss was elected as a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. \nIn 2006 he was awarded the Rothschild Prize in Mathematics.\nIn 2012 Weiss was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[2]\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "Israeli mathematicians", "Dynamical systems theorists", "Princeton University alumni", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "1941 births", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Israeli mathematician (born 1941)\nBenjamin WeissBorn1941 (age\u00a079\u201380)New York CityNationalityIsraeliAlma\u00a0materYeshiva UniversityKnown\u00a0forsofic groupsScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsHebrew UniversityThesis\u00a0(1962)Doctoral advisorWilliam FellerNotable studentsItai Benjamini, Elon Lindenstrauss\n\nBenjamin Weiss (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05df \u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05d9\u05e1\u200e; born 1941) is an American-Israeli mathematician known for his contributions \nto ergodic theory, topological dynamics, probability theory, game theory, and descriptive set theory.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Academic career\n3 Awards and recognition\n4 See also\n5 References\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nBenjamin (\"Benjie\") Weiss was born  in New York City.
