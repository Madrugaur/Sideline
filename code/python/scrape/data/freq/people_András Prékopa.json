{"name": "Andr\u00e1s Pr\u00e9kopa", "content": "Andr\u00e1s Pr\u00e9kopa (September 11, 1929 \u2013 September 18, 2016) was a Hungarian mathematician, a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\n He received his university diploma as teacher of mathematics and physics from the University of Debrecen in 1952.\n In 1952, he became a Ph.D student (aspirant) at the Institute for Applied Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS) and defended his thesis, entitled \"On Stochastic Set Functions\", in 1956. His advisor was Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi.[1] Between 1956-68 he was first assistant, later associate professor at the Department of Probability Theory of the L. E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University. In 1968, he became full professor at the Department of Mathematics of the Technical University of Budapest, where he remained until 1983. In that year he returned to the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University, and became the founder, professor and first chairman of the Department of Operations Research (OR). He retired from there in 2000. From 1985 until 2015, he was a distinguished professor of OR, statistics and mathematics at Rutgers University. He was also the graduate director of the Ph.D program in OR. In 2015 he retired from Rutgers as a distinguished professor emeritus.[2] Pr\u00e9kopa's part-time appointments were also very important in his scientific career in Hungary. In 1958, he founded the first research department in OR at the Math. Inst. of the HAS and in 1977 the Department of Applied Math. at the Computing and Automation Inst. of the HAS.\n Pr\u00e9kopa is the father of the Hungarian Operations Research in many ways: he developed the research school and education curricula, organized international and local conferences, formed an academic committee, founded a scientific periodical, etc. He published more than a dozen books and about 350 papers alone and with co-authors and supervised 51 Ph.D students, many of whom are internationally known academics and industrial leaders.\n In 1979, Pr\u00e9kopa was elected a corresponding member and in 1985 full member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He was also elected a foreign member of the National Academy of Engineering of Mexico, fellow of the Econometric Society, member of the International Statistical Institute and honorary president of the J\u00e1nos Bolyai Mathematical Society and the Hungarian OR Society, among others.\n He was married to Kinga Sz\u00e9chenyi, educator, sculptor and writer; they had two children and two grandchildren.\nHe was a member of the Batthy\u00e1ny Society of Professors.[3]\n ", "tags": ["1929 births", "2016 deaths", "Hungarian mathematicians", "Rutgers University faculty", "Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "Commander's Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary (civil)", "Fellows of the Econometric Society", "CS1 Hungarian-language sources (hu)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles lacking in-text citations from May 2011", "All articles lacking in-text citations", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian mathematician\nThis article includes a list of general references, but it remains largely unverified because it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations.
