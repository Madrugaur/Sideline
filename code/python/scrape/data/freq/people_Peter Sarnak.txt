{"name": "Peter Sarnak", "content": "\n Peter Clive Sarnak FRS MAE[3] (born 18 December 1953) is a South African-born mathematician with dual South-African and American nationalities.[1] Sarnak has been a member of the permanent faculty of the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study since 2007.[4] He is also Eugene Higgins Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University since 2002, succeeding Andrew Wiles, and is an editor of the Annals of Mathematics. He is known for his work in analytic number theory.[4] He also sits on the Board of Adjudicators and the selection committee for the Mathematics award, given under the auspices of the Shaw Prize.\n Sarnak is the grandson of one of Johannesburg's leading rabbis and lived in Israel for three years as a child. He graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand (BSc 1975, BSc(Hons) 1976) and Stanford University (PhD 1980), under the direction of Paul Cohen.[1][2] Sarnak's highly cited work (with A. Lubotzky and R. Philips) applied deep results in number theory to Ramanujan graphs, with connections to combinatorics and computer science.\n Sarnak has made major contributions to analysis and number theory.[3] He is widely recognised internationally as one of the leading analytic number theorists of his generation.[3] His early work on the existence of cusp forms led to the disproof of a conjecture of Atle Selberg.[3] He has obtained the strongest known bounds towards the Ramanujan\u2013Petersson conjectures for sparse graphs, and he was one of the first to exploit connections between certain questions of theoretical physics and analytic number theory.[3] There are fundamental contributions to arithmetical quantum chaos, a term which he introduced, and to the relationship between random matrix theory and the zeros of L-functions.[3] His work on subconvexity for Rankin\u2013Selberg L-functions led to the resolution of Hilbert's eleventh problem.[3] During his career he has held numerous appointments including:\n Peter Sarnak was awarded the P\u00f3lya Prize of Society of Industrial & Applied Mathematics in 1998, the Ostrowski Prize in 2001, the Levi L.
