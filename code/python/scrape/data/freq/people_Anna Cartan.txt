{"name": "Anna Cartan", "content": "\n Anna Cartan (15 May 1878 \u2013 1923) was a French mathematician, teacher and textbook author who was a student of Marie Curie and Jules Tannery.\n Cartan was the youngest child born to Anne Florentine Cottaz (1841\u20131927) and Joseph Antoine Cartan (1837\u20131917), who was the village blacksmith. Anna had an elder sister Jeanne-Marie (1867\u20131931) who became a dressmaker, a brother L\u00e9on (1872\u20131956) who became a blacksmith working in his father's smithy, and a middle brother \u00c9lie Cartan (1869\u20131951) who became an acclaimed mathematician and sire of a family of mathematicians, notably his first son, Henri Cartan, who later became influential in the field.[1][2]\n Anna's brother, \u00c9lie Cartan, later recalled that the family was very poor and his childhood had passed under \"blows of the anvil, which started every morning from dawn,\" and that \"his mother, during those rare minutes when she was free from taking care of the children and the house, was working with a spinning wheel.\"[1]\n As the family was poor, it would have been very unusual for any of the children to attend college, but in 1901, partly under \u00c9lie's influence, Anna Cartan entered \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de jeunes filles in S\u00e8vres near Paris, France.[1][2] Anna chose to pursue mathematics to become a secondary school teacher. Among the courses she attended were those led by Marie Curie (who taught physics there from 1900 to 1906) and mathematician Jules Tannery (1848\u20131910).[2] One of her friends was the scientist and women's rights activist Eug\u00e9nie (Feytis) Cotton who would become director of the school in 1936. Another friend was Marthe Baillaud, the niece of Jules Tannery. Anna completed her studies in mathematics in 1904 and taught the subject at the high school in Poitiers, France from 1904 to 1906, and then she taught in Dijon from 1906 to 1908.[2]\n In 1908, Cartan received a one-year scholarship established by a French philanthropist Albert Kahn to travel around the world to allow her to \"enrich her skills and future education by direct knowledge of the world.\"[3] Among the places she visited were the United States (New York, St. Louis, Chicago, Boston and Niagara Falls), Quebec, Mexico and Cuba.[2] After the tour, she returned to Dijon and taught there until 1916. Then she taught at the Jules Ferry high school in Paris and, until 1920, at the S\u00e8vres application school, annexed to the normal school.[2]\n In 1912 and 1913, Cartan wrote two books on arithmetic and geometry for girls, and later she co-authored with her brother \u00c9lie two more textbooks for both boys and girls.[2]\n Cartan died of cancer in 1923.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1878 births", "1923 deaths", "French mathematicians", "French women mathematicians", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from December 2019", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French mathematician\n\n\nAnna CartanBorn(1878-05-15)15 May 1878Died1923 (aged\u00a044\u201345)OccupationMathematician, teacher and author\nAnna Cartan (15 May 1878 \u2013 1923) was a French mathematician, teacher and textbook author who was a student of Marie Curie and Jules Tannery.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early years\n2 Mathematics career\n3 Works\n4 References\n\n\nEarly years[edit]\nCartan was the youngest child born to Anne Florentine Cottaz (1841\u20131927) and Joseph Antoine Cartan (1837\u20131917), who was the village blacksmith.
