He designed Florence Cathedral and the sixth city wall around Florence (1284-1333),[3] while his most important surviving work as a sculptor is the tomb of Cardinal de Braye in S. Domenico, Orvieto.[4]\n Arnolfo was born in Colle Val d'Elsa, Tuscany.\n He was Nicola Pisano\u2019s chief assistant on the marble Siena Cathedral Pulpit for the Duomo in Siena Cathedral (1265\u20131268), but he soon began to work independently on an important tomb sculpture. In 1266\u20131267 he worked in Rome for King Charles I of Anjou, portraying him in the famous statue housed in the Campidoglio. Around 1282 he finished the monument to Cardinal Guillaume de Braye in the church of San Domenico in Orvieto, including an enthroned Madonna (a Maest\u00e0) for which he took as a model an ancient Roman statue of the goddess Abundantia; the Madonna's tiara and jewels reproduce antique models.[5] In Rome Arnolfo had seen the Cosmatesque art, and its influence can be seen in the intarsia and polychrome glass decorations in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls and the church Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, where he worked in 1285 and 1293 respectively. In this period he also worked on the presepio of Santa Maria Maggiore, on Santa Maria in Aracoeli, on the monument of Pope Boniface VIII (1300) and on the bronze statue of St. Peter in St. Peter's Basilica.\n In 1294\u20131295 he worked in Florence, mainly as an architect. According to his biographer Giorgio Vasari, he was in charge of construction of the cathedral of the city, for which he provided the statues once decorating the lower part of the fa\u00e7ade destroyed in 1589. The surviving statues are now in the Museum of the Cathedral. While the design of the Church of Santa Croce has been attributed to Arnolfo, this is highly disputed. Vasari also attributed to him the urban plan of the new city of San Giovanni Valdarno.\n The monumental character of Arnolfo's work has left its mark on the appearance of Florence. His funerary monuments became the model for Gothic funerary art.\n Giorgio Vasari included a biography of Arnolfo in his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.\n ", "tags": ["1240 births", "14th-century deaths", "People from Colle di Val d'Elsa", "Architects of cathedrals", "Gothic architects", "Gothic sculptors", "13th-century people of the Republic of Florence", "13th-century Italian architects", "13th-century Italian sculptors", "Italian male sculptors", "CS1 maint: others", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from April 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "13th century Italian architect and sculptor\n\n\nArnolfo di CambioArnolfo di Cambio by VasariBornArnolfo di Lapo1232/1240Colle di Val d'ElsaDied(1302-03-08)8 March 1302/1310FlorenceNationalityItalianOccupationArchitect and sculptor\n The ciborium over the high altar of St. John Lateran is derived from a design by Arnolfo di Cambio and decorated with paintings by Barna da Siena in 1367\u20131368.
