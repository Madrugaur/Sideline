{"name": "P\u0101\u1e47ini", "content": "\n \u2014 JF Staal, A reader on the Sanskrit Grammarians[8]\n P\u0101\u1e47ini (Devanagari: \u092a\u093e\u0923\u093f\u0928\u093f, pronounced\u00a0[pa\u02d0\u0273\u026an\u026a]) was a Sanskrit philologist, grammarian, and a revered scholar in ancient India,[7][9][10] variously dated between the 6th[5][6][note 1] and 4th century BCE.[1][2][3][4]\n Since the discovery and publication of his work by European scholars in the nineteenth century, P\u0101\u1e47ini has been considered the \"first descriptive linguist\",[11] and even labelled as \u201cthe father of linguistics\u201d.[12][13][14]\n P\u0101\u1e47ini's grammar was influential on such foundational linguists as Ferdinand de Saussure and Leonard Bloomfield.[15]\n P\u0101\u1e47ini is known for his text A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b, a sutra-style treatise on Sanskrit grammar,[10][7] 3,959 verses or rules on linguistics, syntax and semantics in \"eight chapters\" which is the foundational text of the Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a branch of the Vedanga, the auxiliary scholarly disciplines of the Vedic period.[16][17][18] His aphoristic text attracted numerous bhashya (commentaries), of which Patanjali's Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya is the most famous in Hindu traditions.[19]His ideas influenced and attracted commentaries from scholars of other Indian religions such as Buddhism.[20]\n P\u0101\u1e47ini's analysis of noun compounds still forms the basis of modern linguistic theories of compounding in Indian languages. P\u0101\u1e47ini's comprehensive and scientific theory of grammar is conventionally taken to mark the start of Classical Sanskrit.[21] His systematic treatise inspired and made Sanskrit the preeminent Indian language of learning and literature for two millennia.\n P\u0101\u1e47ini's theory of morphological analysis was more advanced than any equivalent Western theory before the 20th century.[22] His treatise is generative and descriptive, uses metalanguage and meta-rules, and has been compared to the Turing machine wherein the logical structure of any computing device has been reduced to its essentials using an idealized mathematical model.[23]\n \u2014 Rens Bod, University of Amsterdam[24]\n P\u0101\u1e47ini likely lived in \u015aalatura in ancient Gandh\u0101ra in the northwest Indian subcontinent[a] during the Mah\u0101janapada era.[25][4]\n The name P\u0101\u1e47ini is a patronymic meaning descendant of Pa\u1e47ina.[26] His full name was \"Dak\u1e63iputra P\u0101\u1e47ini\" according to verses 1.75.13 and 3.251.12 of Patanjali's Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya, with the first part suggesting his mother's name was Dak\u1e63i.[6]\n Nothing definite is known about when P\u0101\u1e47ini lived, not even in which century he lived. P\u0101\u1e47ini has been dated between the seventh[27] or sixth[6] and fourth century BCE.[28][1][2][3][4][note 1] Von Hin\u00fcber (1989) based on numismatic arguments and Falk (1993) based on his Indic script studies, place him in mid-fourth century BCE.[28][1][2][3] Others use internal evidence and textual evidence in ancient Indian texts to date him in the sixth or fifth century BCE,[6] while Bod mentions the seventh to fifth century BCE.[24] George Cardona (1997) in his authoritative survey and review of P\u0101\u1e47ini-related studies, states that the available evidence strongly supports a dating no later than between 400 to 350 BCE, while earlier dating depends on interpretations and is not probative.[29]\n According to Bod, P\u0101\u1e47ini's grammar defines Classical Sanskrit, so P\u0101\u1e47ini is chronologically placed in the later part of the Vedic period.[24] According to A. B. Keith, the Sanskrit text that most matches the language described by P\u0101\u1e47ini is the Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a (8th-6th c. BCE).[30] According to Scharfe, \"his proximity to the Vedic language as found in the Upanisads and Vedic s\u016btras suggests the 5th or maybe 6th c. B.C.\"[6]\n Based on numismatic findings, Von Hin\u00fcber and Falk place P\u0101\u1e47ini in the mid-4th century BCE. P\u0101\u1e47ini's rupya (A 5.2.120) mentions a specific coin which was introduced in India in the 4th-century BCE.[3] According to Houben, \"the date of \"ca. 350 B.C.E. for P\u0101\u1e47ini is thus based on concrete evidence which till now has not been refuted.\"[3] According to Bronkhorst, there is no reason to doubt the validity of Von Hin\u00fcber's and Falk's argument, setting the terminus post quem[b] for the date of P\u0101\u1e47ini at 350 BCE or the decades thereafter. [28] According to Bronkhorst, \n ...thanks to the work carried out by Hin\u00fcber (1990:34-35) and Falk (1993: 303-304), we now know that P\u0101\u1e47ini lived, in all probability, far closer in time to the period of A\u015boka than had hitherto been thought. According to Falk's reasoning, Panini must have lived during the decennia following 350 BCE, i.e. just before (or contemporaneously with?) the invasion of Alexander of Macedonia[2] Cardona mentions two major pieces of internal evidence for the dating of P\u0101\u1e47ini.[31] The occurrence of the word yavan\u0101n\u012b in 4.1.49, referring to a writing (lipi) c.q. cuneiform writing, or to Greek writing, suggests a date for P\u0101\u1e47ini after Alexander the Great. Cardona rejects this possibility, arguing that yavan\u0101n\u012b may also refer to a Yavana woman; and that Indians had contacts with the Greek world before Alexander's conquests.[32][note 3] Sutra 2.1.70 of P\u0101\u1e47ini mentions kum\u0101ra\u015brama\u1e47a, derived from \u015brama\u1e47a, which refers to a female renunciates, c.q. \"Buddhist nuns,\" implying that P\u0101\u1e47ini should be placed after Gautama Buddha. K. B. Pathak (1930) argued that kum\u0101ra\u015brama\u1e47a could also refer to a Jain nun, meaning that P\u0101\u1e47ini is not necessarily to be placed after the Buddha.[31]\n It is not certain whether P\u0101\u1e47ini used writing for the composition of his work, though it is generally agreed that he knew of a form of writing, based on references to words such as lipi (\"script\") and lipikara (\"scribe\") in section 3.2 of the  A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b.[35][36][37] The dating of the introduction of writing in India may therefore give further information on the dating of P\u0101\u1e47ini.[note 4]\n P\u0101\u1e47ini cites at least ten grammarians and linguists before him: \u0100pi\u015bali, K\u0101\u015byapa, G\u0101rgya, G\u0101lava, C\u0101kravarma\u1e47a, Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja, \u015a\u0101ka\u1e6d\u0101yana, \u015a\u0101kalya, Senaka and Spho\u1e6d\u0101yana.[44] According to Kamal K. Misra, P\u0101\u1e47ini also refers to Yaska, \"whose writings date back to the middle of the 4th century B.C.\"[45] Both Brihatkatha and Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b-m\u016bla-kalpa mention P\u0101\u1e47ini to have been a contemporary with the Nanda king (4th c. BCE).[46]\n Nothing certain is known about P\u0101\u1e47ini's personal life. In an inscription of Siladitya VII of Valabhi, he is called \u015aal\u0101turiya, which means \"man from Salatura\". This means Panini lived in Salatura of ancient Gandhara, which likely was near Lahor, a town at the junction of Indus and Kabul rivers.[d][47][48] According to the memoirs of 7th-century Chinese scholar Xuanzang, there was a town called Suoluoduluo on the Indus where P\u0101\u1e47ini was born, and he composed the Qingming-lun (Sanskrit: Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a).[47][49][50]\n According to Hartmut Scharfe, P\u0101\u1e47ini lived in Gandhara close to the borders of the Achaemenid Empire, and Gandhara was then an Achaemenian satrapy following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley. He must, therefore, have been technically a Persian subject but his work shows no awareness of the Persian language.[6][51] According to Patrick Olivelle, P\u0101\u1e47ini's text and references to him elsewhere suggest that \"he was clearly a northerner, probably from the northwestern region\".[52]\n Panini is mentioned in Indian fables and ancient texts. The Panchatantra, for example, mentions that P\u0101\u1e47ini was killed by a lion.[53][54][55]\n P\u0101\u1e47ini was depicted on a five-rupee Indian postage stamp in August, 2004.[56][57][58][59]\n The most important of P\u0101\u1e47ini's works, the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b is a grammar that essentially defines the Sanskrit language. Modeled on the dialect and register of elite speakers in his time, the text also accounts for some features of the older Vedic language. \n The A\u1e63t\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b is a prescriptive and generative grammar with algebraic rules governing every aspect of the language. It is supplemented by three ancillary texts: ak\u1e63arasam\u0101mn\u0101ya, dh\u0101tup\u0101\u1e6dha[A] and ga\u1e47ap\u0101\u1e6dha.[B][60]\n Growing out of a centuries-long effort to preserve the language of the Vedic hymns from 'corruption', the A\u1e63t\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b is the high point of a vigorous, sophisticated grammatical tradition devised to arrest language change. The A\u1e63t\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b's preeminence is underlined by the fact that it eclipsed all similar works that came before: while not the first, it is the oldest such text surviving in its entirety.[61][62][63][64]\n The A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b consists of 3,959 s\u016btras[C] in eight chapters, which are each subdivided into four sections or p\u0101das. The text takes material from lexical lists (dh\u0101tup\u0101\u1e6dha, ga\u1e47ap\u0101tha) as input and describes algorithms to be applied to them for the generation of well-formed words.\n The A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b, composed in an era when oral composition and transmission was the norm, is staunchly embedded in that oral tradition. In order to ensure wide dissemination, P\u0101\u1e47ini is said to have preferred brevity over clarity[65] - it can be recited end-to-end in two hours. This has led to the emergence of a great number of commentaries[\u03b1] of his work over the centuries, which for the most part adhere to the foundations laid by P\u0101\u1e47ini's work.[66][61]\n The learning of Indian curriculum in late classical times had at its heart a system of grammatical study and linguistic analysis.[67] The core text for this study was the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b of P\u0101\u1e47ini, the sine qua non of learning.[68] This grammar of P\u0101\u1e47ini had been the object of intense study for the ten centuries prior to the composition of the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dik\u0101vya. It was plainly Bha\u1e6d\u1e6di's purpose to provide a study aid to P\u0101\u1e47ini's text by using the examples already provided in the existing grammatical commentaries in the context of the gripping and morally improving story of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. To the dry bones of this grammar Bha\u1e6d\u1e6di has given juicy flesh in his poem. The intention of the author was to teach this advanced science through a relatively easy and pleasant medium. In his own words:\n This composition is like a lamp to those who perceive the meaning of words and like a hand mirror for a blind man to those without grammar.\nThis poem, which is to be understood by means of a commentary, is a joy to those sufficiently learned: through my fondness for the scholar I have here slighted the dullard. \nBha\u1e6d\u1e6dik\u0101vya 22.33\u201334.\n P\u0101\u1e47ini's work became known in 19th-century Europe, where it influenced modern linguistics initially through Franz Bopp, who mainly looked at P\u0101\u1e47ini.  Subsequently, a wider body of work influenced Sanskrit scholars such as Ferdinand de Saussure, Leonard Bloomfield, and Roman Jakobson. Frits Staal (1930\u20132012) discussed the impact of Indian ideas on language in Europe. After outlining the various aspects of the contact, Staal notes that the idea of formal rules in language\u00a0\u2013 proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure in 1894 and developed by Noam Chomsky in 1957\u00a0\u2013 has origins in the European exposure to the formal rules of P\u0101\u1e47inian grammar.[69] In particular, de Saussure, who lectured on Sanskrit for three decades, may have been influenced by P\u0101\u1e47ini and Bhartrihari; his idea of the unity of signifier-signified in the sign somewhat resembles the notion of Spho\u1e6da. More importantly, the very idea that formal rules can be applied to areas outside of logic or mathematics may itself have been catalysed by Europe's contact with the work of Sanskrit grammarians.[69]\n P\u0101\u1e47ini, and the later Indian linguist Bhartrihari, had a significant influence on many of the foundational ideas proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure, professor of Sanskrit, who is widely considered the father of modern structural linguistics and with Charles S. Peirce on the other side, to semiotics, although the concept Saussure used was semiology. Saussure himself cited Indian grammar as an influence on some of his ideas. In his M\u00e9moire sur le syst\u00e8me primitif des voyelles dans les langues indo-europ\u00e9ennes (Memoir on the Original System of Vowels in the Indo-European Languages) published in 1879, he mentions Indian grammar as an influence on his idea that \"reduplicated aorists represent imperfects of a verbal class.\" In his De l'emploi du g\u00e9nitif absolu en sanscrit (On the Use of the Genitive Absolute in Sanskrit) published in 1881, he specifically mentions P\u0101\u1e47ini as an influence on the work.[70]\n Prem Singh, in his foreword to the reprint edition of the German translation of P\u0101\u1e47ini's Grammar in 1998, concluded that the \"effect Panini's work had on Indo-European linguistics shows itself in various studies\" and that a \"number of seminal works come to mind,\" including Saussure's works and the analysis that \"gave rise to the laryngeal theory,\" further stating: \"This type of structural analysis suggests influence from Panini's analytical teaching.\" George Cardona, however, warns against overestimating the influence of P\u0101\u1e47ini on modern linguistics: \"Although Saussure also refers to predecessors who had taken this Paninian rule into account, it is reasonable to conclude that he had a direct acquaintance with Panini's work. As far as I am able to discern upon rereading Saussure's M\u00e9moire, however, it shows no direct influence of Paninian grammar. Indeed, on occasion, Saussure follows a path that is contrary to Paninian procedure.\"[70][71]\n The founding father of American structuralism, Leonard Bloomfield, wrote a 1927 paper titled \"On some rules of P\u0101\u1e47ini\".[72]\n P\u0101\u1e47ini's grammar is the world's first formal system, developed well before the 19th century innovations of Gottlob Frege and the subsequent development of mathematical logic. In designing his grammar, P\u0101\u1e47ini used the method of \"auxiliary symbols\", in which new affixes are designated to mark syntactic categories and the control of grammatical derivations. This technique, rediscovered by the logician Emil Post, became a standard method in the design of computer programming languages.[73][74] Sanskritists now accept that P\u0101\u1e47ini's linguistic apparatus is well-described as an \"applied\" Post system.  Considerable evidence shows ancient mastery of context-sensitive grammars, and a general ability to solve many complex problems.

P\u0101\u1e47ini has been dated between the seventh[27] or sixth[6] and fourth century BCE.[28][1][2][3][4][note 1] Von Hin\u00fcber (1989) based on numismatic arguments and Falk (1993) based on his Indic script studies, place him in mid-fourth century BCE.[28][1][2][3] Others use internal evidence and textual evidence in ancient Indian texts to date him in the sixth or fifth century BCE,[6] while Bod mentions the seventh to fifth century BCE.[24] George Cardona (1997) in his authoritative survey and review of P\u0101\u1e47ini-related studies, states that the available evidence strongly supports a dating no later than between 400 to 350 BCE, while earlier dating depends on interpretations and is not probative.[29]\nAccording to Bod, P\u0101\u1e47ini's grammar defines Classical Sanskrit, so P\u0101\u1e47ini is chronologically placed in the later part of the Vedic period.[24] According to A. B. Keith, the Sanskrit text that most matches the language described by P\u0101\u1e47ini is the Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a (8th-6th c. BCE).[30] According to Scharfe, \"his proximity to the Vedic language as found in the Upanisads and Vedic s\u016btras suggests the 5th or maybe 6th c. B.C.\"[6]\nBased on numismatic findings, Von Hin\u00fcber and Falk place P\u0101\u1e47ini in the mid-4th century BCE. P\u0101\u1e47ini's rupya (A 5.2.120) mentions a specific coin which was introduced in India in the 4th-century BCE.[3] According to Houben, \"the date of \"ca. 350 B.C.E. for P\u0101\u1e47ini is thus based on concrete evidence which till now has not been refuted.\"[3] According to Bronkhorst, there is no reason to doubt the validity of Von Hin\u00fcber's and Falk's argument, setting the terminus post quem[b] for the date of P\u0101\u1e47ini at 350 BCE or the decades thereafter. [28] According to Bronkhorst, \n\n...thanks to the work carried out by Hin\u00fcber (1990:34-35) and Falk (1993: 303-304), we now know that P\u0101\u1e47ini lived, in all probability, far closer in time to the period of A\u015boka than had hitherto been thought. According to Falk's reasoning, Panini must have lived during the decennia following 350 BCE, i.e. just before (or contemporaneously with?) the invasion of Alexander of Macedonia[2]\nCardona mentions two major pieces of internal evidence for the dating of P\u0101\u1e47ini.[31] The occurrence of the word yavan\u0101n\u012b in 4.1.49, referring to a writing (lipi) c.q. cuneiform writing, or to Greek writing, suggests a date for P\u0101\u1e47ini after Alexander the Great. Cardona rejects this possibility, arguing that yavan\u0101n\u012b may also refer to a Yavana woman; and that Indians had contacts with the Greek world before Alexander's conquests.[32][note 3] Sutra 2.1.70 of P\u0101\u1e47ini mentions kum\u0101ra\u015brama\u1e47a, derived from \u015brama\u1e47a, which refers to a female renunciates, c.q. \"Buddhist nuns,\" implying that P\u0101\u1e47ini should be placed after Gautama Buddha. K. B. Pathak (1930) argued that kum\u0101ra\u015brama\u1e47a could also refer to a Jain nun, meaning that P\u0101\u1e47ini is not necessarily to be placed after the Buddha.[31]\nIt is not certain whether P\u0101\u1e47ini used writing for the composition of his work, though it is generally agreed that he knew of a form of writing, based on references to words such as lipi (\"script\") and lipikara (\"scribe\") in section 3.2 of the  A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b.[35][36][37] The dating of the introduction of writing in India may therefore give further information on the dating of P\u0101\u1e47ini.[note 4]\nP\u0101\u1e47ini cites at least ten grammarians and linguists before him: \u0100pi\u015bali, K\u0101\u015byapa, G\u0101rgya, G\u0101lava, C\u0101kravarma\u1e47a, Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja, \u015a\u0101ka\u1e6d\u0101yana, \u015a\u0101kalya, Senaka and Spho\u1e6d\u0101yana.[44] According to Kamal K. Misra, P\u0101\u1e47ini also refers to Yaska, \"whose writings date back to the middle of the 4th century B.C.\"[45] Both Brihatkatha and Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b-m\u016bla-kalpa mention P\u0101\u1e47ini to have been a contemporary with the Nanda king (4th c. BCE).[46]\n\nLocation[edit]\nNothing certain is known about P\u0101\u1e47ini's personal life. In an inscription of Siladitya VII of Valabhi, he is called \u015aal\u0101turiya, which means \"man from Salatura\". This means Panini lived in Salatura of ancient Gandhara, which likely was near Lahor, a town at the junction of Indus and Kabul rivers.[d][47][48] According to the memoirs of 7th-century Chinese scholar Xuanzang, there was a town called Suoluoduluo on the Indus where P\u0101\u1e47ini was born, and he composed the Qingming-lun (Sanskrit: Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a).[47][49][50]\nAccording to Hartmut Scharfe, P\u0101\u1e47ini lived in Gandhara close to the borders of the Achaemenid Empire, and Gandhara was then an Achaemenian satrapy following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley. He must, therefore, have been technically a Persian subject but his work shows no awareness of the Persian language.[6][51] According to Patrick Olivelle, P\u0101\u1e47ini's text and references to him elsewhere suggest that \"he was clearly a northerner, probably from the northwestern region\".[52]\n\nLegends and later reception[edit]\nPanini is mentioned in Indian fables and ancient texts. The Panchatantra, for example, mentions that P\u0101\u1e47ini was killed by a lion.[53][54][55]\nP\u0101\u1e47ini was depicted on a five-rupee Indian postage stamp in August, 2004.[56][57][58][59]\n\nA\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b[edit]\nMain article: A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b\nThe most important of P\u0101\u1e47ini's works, the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b is a grammar that essentially defines the Sanskrit language. Modeled on the dialect and register of elite speakers in his time, the text also accounts for some features of the older Vedic language. \nThe A\u1e63t\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b is a prescriptive and generative grammar with algebraic rules governing every aspect of the language. It is supplemented by three ancillary texts: ak\u1e63arasam\u0101mn\u0101ya, dh\u0101tup\u0101\u1e6dha[A] and ga\u1e47ap\u0101\u1e6dha.[B][60]\nGrowing out of a centuries-long effort to preserve the language of the Vedic hymns from 'corruption', the A\u1e63t\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b is the high point of a vigorous, sophisticated grammatical tradition devised to arrest language change. The A\u1e63t\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b's preeminence is underlined by the fact that it eclipsed all similar works that came before: while not the first, it is the oldest such text surviving in its entirety.[61][62][63][64]\nThe A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b consists of 3,959 s\u016btras[C] in eight chapters, which are each subdivided into four sections or p\u0101das. The text takes material from lexical lists (dh\u0101tup\u0101\u1e6dha, ga\u1e47ap\u0101tha) as input and describes algorithms to be applied to them for the generation of well-formed words.\nThe A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b, composed in an era when oral composition and transmission was the norm, is staunchly embedded in that oral tradition. In order to ensure wide dissemination, P\u0101\u1e47ini is said to have preferred brevity over clarity[65] - it can be recited end-to-end in two hours. This has led to the emergence of a great number of commentaries[\u03b1] of his work over the centuries, which for the most part adhere to the foundations laid by P\u0101\u1e47ini's work.[66][61]\n\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6dik\u0101vya[edit]\nMain article: Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dik\u0101vya\nThe learning of Indian curriculum in late classical times had at its heart a system of grammatical study and linguistic analysis.[67] The core text for this study was the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b of P\u0101\u1e47ini, the sine qua non of learning.[68] This grammar of P\u0101\u1e47ini had been the object of intense study for the ten centuries prior to the composition of the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dik\u0101vya. It was plainly Bha\u1e6d\u1e6di's purpose to provide a study aid to P\u0101\u1e47ini's text by using the examples already provided in the existing grammatical commentaries in the context of the gripping and morally improving story of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. To the dry bones of this grammar Bha\u1e6d\u1e6di has given juicy flesh in his poem. The intention of the author was to teach this advanced science through a relatively easy and pleasant medium. In his own words:\n\n\nThis composition is like a lamp to those who perceive the meaning of words and like a hand mirror for a blind man to those without grammar.\nThis poem, which is to be understood by means of a commentary, is a joy to those sufficiently learned: through my fondness for the scholar I have here slighted the dullard. \nBha\u1e6d\u1e6dik\u0101vya 22.33\u201334.\n\n\nModern linguistics[edit]\nP\u0101\u1e47ini's work became known in 19th-century Europe, where it influenced modern linguistics initially through Franz Bopp, who mainly looked at P\u0101\u1e47ini.  Subsequently, a wider body of work influenced Sanskrit scholars such as Ferdinand de Saussure, Leonard Bloomfield, and Roman Jakobson. Frits Staal (1930\u20132012) discussed the impact of Indian ideas on language in Europe. After outlining the various aspects of the contact, Staal notes that the idea of formal rules in language\u00a0\u2013 proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure in 1894 and developed by Noam Chomsky in 1957\u00a0\u2013 has origins in the European exposure to the formal rules of P\u0101\u1e47inian grammar.[69] In particular, de Saussure, who lectured on Sanskrit for three decades, may have been influenced by P\u0101\u1e47ini and Bhartrihari; his idea of the unity of signifier-signified in the sign somewhat resembles the notion of Spho\u1e6da. More importantly, the very idea that formal rules can be applied to areas outside of logic or mathematics may itself have been catalysed by Europe's contact with the work of Sanskrit grammarians.[69]\n\nDe Saussure[edit]\nP\u0101\u1e47ini, and the later Indian linguist Bhartrihari, had a significant influence on many of the foundational ideas proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure, professor of Sanskrit, who is widely considered the father of modern structural linguistics and with Charles S. Peirce on the other side, to semiotics, although the concept Saussure used was semiology. Saussure himself cited Indian grammar as an influence on some of his ideas. In his M\u00e9moire sur le syst\u00e8me primitif des voyelles dans les langues indo-europ\u00e9ennes (Memoir on the Original System of Vowels in the Indo-European Languages) published in 1879, he mentions Indian grammar as an influence on his idea that \"reduplicated aorists represent imperfects of a verbal class.\" In his De l'emploi du g\u00e9nitif absolu en sanscrit (On the Use of the Genitive Absolute in Sanskrit) published in 1881, he specifically mentions P\u0101\u1e47ini as an influence on the work.[70]\nPrem Singh, in his foreword to the reprint edition of the German translation of P\u0101\u1e47ini's Grammar in 1998, concluded that the \"effect Panini's work had on Indo-European linguistics shows itself in various studies\" and that a \"number of seminal works come to mind,\" including Saussure's works and the analysis that \"gave rise to the laryngeal theory,\" further stating: \"This type of structural analysis suggests influence from Panini's analytical teaching.\" George Cardona, however, warns against overestimating the influence of P\u0101\u1e47ini on modern linguistics: \"Although Saussure also refers to predecessors who had taken this Paninian rule into account, it is reasonable to conclude that he had a direct acquaintance with Panini's work. As far as I am able to discern upon rereading Saussure's M\u00e9moire, however, it shows no direct influence of Paninian grammar. Indeed, on occasion, Saussure follows a path that is contrary to Paninian procedure.\"[70][71]\n\nLeonard Bloomfield[edit]\nThe founding father of American structuralism, Leonard Bloomfield, wrote a 1927 paper titled \"On some rules of P\u0101\u1e47ini\".[72]\n\nComparison with modern formal systems[edit]\nP\u0101\u1e47ini's grammar is the world's first formal system, developed well before the 19th century innovations of Gottlob Frege and the subsequent development of mathematical logic. In designing his grammar, P\u0101\u1e47ini used the method of \"auxiliary symbols\", in which new affixes are designated to mark syntactic categories and the control of grammatical derivations. This technique, rediscovered by the logician Emil Post, became a standard method in the design of computer programming languages.[73][74] Sanskritists now accept that P\u0101\u1e47ini's linguistic apparatus is well-described as an \"applied\" Post system.  Considerable evidence shows ancient mastery of context-sensitive grammars, and a general ability to solve many complex problems. Frits Staal has written that \"Panini is the Indian Euclid.\"[citation needed]\n\nOther works[edit]\nTwo literary works are attributed to P\u0101\u1e47ini, though they are now lost.\n\nJ\u0101mbavati Vijaya is a lost work cited by Rajashekhara in Jalhana's Sukti Mukt\u0101val\u012b.

Only recently have more serious proposals been made. Oskar von Hin\u00fcber (1990: 34) arrives, on  the basis of a comparison of P\u0101\u1e47ini's text with numismatic findings, at a date that can hardly be much earlier than 350 BCE; Harry Falk (1993: 304; 1994: 327 n. 45) refines these reflections and moves the date forward to the decennia following 350 BCE.

Harry Falk in his 1993 overview states that ancient Indians neither knew nor used writing script, and P\u0101\u1e47ini's mention is likely a reference to Semitic and Greek scripts.[38] In his 1995 review, Salomon questions Falk's arguments and writes it is \"speculative at best and hardly constitutes firm grounds for a late date for Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b. The stronger argument for this position is that we have no specimen of the script before the time of A\u015boka, nor any direct evidence of intermediate stages in its development; but of course this does not mean that such earlier forms did not exist, only that, if they did exist, they have not survived, presumably because they were not employed for monumental purposes before A\u015boka\".[39] According to Hartmut Scharfe, Lipi of P\u0101\u1e47ini may be borrowed from the Old Persian Dipi, in turn derived from Sumerian Dup. Scharfe adds that the best evidence, at the time of his review, is that no script was used in India, aside from the Northwest Indian subcontinent, before around 300 BCE because Indian tradition \"at every occasion stresses the orality of the cultural and literary heritage.\"[40] Kenneth Norman states writing scripts in ancient India evolved over the long period of time like other cultures, that it is unlikely that ancient Indians developed a single complete writing system at one and the same time in the Maurya era. It is even less likely, states Norman, that a writing script was invented during Ashoka's rule, starting from nothing, for the specific purpose of writing his inscriptions and then it was understood all over South Asia where the A\u015boka pillars are found.[41] Jack Goody states that ancient India likely had a \"very old culture of writing\" along with its oral tradition of composing and transmitting knowledge, because the Vedic literature is too vast, consistent and complex to have been entirely created, memorized, accurately preserved and spread without a written system.[42] Falk disagrees with Goody, and suggests that it is a Western presumption and inability to imagine that remarkably early scientific achievements such as P\u0101\u1e47ini's grammar (5th to 4th century BCE), and the creation, preservation and wide distribution of the large corpus of the Brahmanic Vedic literature and the Buddhist canonical literature, without any writing scripts. Johannes Bronkhorst disagrees with Falk, and states, \"Falk goes too far. It is fair to expect that we believe that Vedic memorisation \u2014 though without parallel in any other human society \u2014 has been able to preserve very long texts for many centuries without losing a syllable. (...) However, the oral composition of a work as complex as P\u0101\u1e47ini's grammar is not only without parallel in other human cultures, it is without parallel in India itself. (...) It just will not do to state that our difficulty in conceiving any such thing is our problem\".[43]\n\n\nGlossary[edit]\n\n\n^ dh\u0101tu: root, p\u0101\u1e6dha: reading, lesson\n\n^ ga\u1e47a: class\n\n^ aphoristic threads\n\n\nTraditional glossary and notes[edit]\n\n\n^ bh\u0101\u1e63yas\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e Vergiani 2017, p.\u00a0243, n.4.\n\n^ a b c d e f Bronkhorst 2016, p.\u00a0171.\n\n^ a b c d e f g Houben 2009, p.\u00a06. sfn error: no target: CITEREFHouben2009 (help)\n\n^ a b c d e f Cardona 1997, p.\u00a0268.\n\n^ a b c Staal 1996, p.\u00a039.\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i Scharfe 1977, p.\u00a088.\n\n^ a b c Staal 1965.\n\n^ Staal 1972, p.\u00a0xi.\n\n^ Lidova 1994, p.\u00a0108-112.\n\n^ a b Lochtefeld 2002a, p.\u00a064\u201365, 140, 402. sfn error: no target: CITEREFLochtefeld2002a (help)\n\n^ Fran\u00e7ois & Ponsonnet (2013: 184).\n\n^ Bod 2013, p.\u00a014-19.\n\n^ Pata\u00f1jali; Ballantyne, James Robert; Kaiya\u1e6da; N\u0101ge\u015babha\u1e6d\u1e6da (1855).
