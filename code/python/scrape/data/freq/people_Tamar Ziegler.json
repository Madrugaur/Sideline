She holds the Henry and Manya Noskwith Chair of Mathematics at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University.\n Ziegler received her Ph.D. in Mathematics from the Hebrew University under the supervision of Hillel Furstenberg.[2] Her thesis title was \u201cNon conventional ergodic averages\u201d. She spent five years in the US as a postdoc at the Ohio State University, the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, and the University of Michigan. She was a faculty member at the Technion during the years 2007\u20132013, and joined the Hebrew University in the Fall of 2013 as a full professor. \n Ziegler received several awards and honors for her work including the Anna and Lajos Erd\u0151s Prize in mathematics in 2011, and the Bruno memorial award in 2015.
