Holdener's primary interest is in number theory. She discovered a simpler proof of the theorem of Touchard, which states that every perfect number is of the form 2k, 12k+1, or 36k+9.\n Holdener earned her B.S. in mathematics at Kent State University and her M.S. and Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Holdener joined the faculty of Kenyon College in 1997, where she is currently the John B. McCoy Distinguished Teaching Chair.\n The poem Euler's Daughter by award-winning South African poet Athol Williams is dedicated to Holdener in celebration of her love of mathematics and life.[1]\n This article incorporates material from Judy Holdener on PlanetMath, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License.\n \n This article about an American mathematician is a stub.
