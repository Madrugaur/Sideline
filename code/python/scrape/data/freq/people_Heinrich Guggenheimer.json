{"name": "Heinrich Guggenheimer", "content": "Heinrich Walter Guggenheimer (July 21, 1924 \u2013 March 4, 2021 [1]) was a German-born Swiss[2]-American mathematician who has contributed to knowledge in differential geometry, topology, algebraic geometry, and convexity. He has also contributed volumes on Jewish sacred literature.\n Heinrich Guggenheimer was born in Nuremberg, Germany. He is the son of Marguerite Bloch and the Physicist Dr. Siegfried Guggenheimer. He studied in Zurich, Switzerland at the Eidgen\u00f6ssiche Technische Hochschule, receiving his diploma in 1947 and a D.Sc. in 1951. His dissertation was titled \"On complex analytic manifolds with Kahler metric\". It was published in Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici:25:257\u201397 (in German).\n Guggenheimer began his teaching career at Hebrew University as lecturer 1954\u20136. He was a professor at Bar Ilan University 1956\u20139. In 1959 he immigrated to the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1965. Washington State University was his first American post, where he was an associate professor. After one year he moved to University of Minnesota where he was raised to a full professor in 1962. While in Minnesota he wrote Differential Geometry (1963), a textbook treating \"classical problems with modern methods\". According to Robert Hermann[3] in 1979, \"Among today's treatises, the best one from the point of view of the Erlangen Program is Differential Geometry by H. Guggenheimer, Dover Publications, 1977.\"\n In 1967 Guggenheimer published Plane Geometry and its Groups (Holden Day), and moved to New York City to teach at Polytechnic University, now called Polytechnic Institute of New York University. In 1977 he published Applicable Geometry: Global and Local Convexity.[4]\n Until 1995 Guggenheimer produced a steady stream of papers in mathematical journals. As a supervisor of graduate study in Minnesota and New York he had six students proceed to Ph.D.s with theses supervised by him, two in Minnesota and four in New York. See the link to the Mathematics Genealogy Project below.\n Guggenheimer has also contributed to literature on Judaism. In 1966 he wrote \"Logical problems in Jewish tradition\".[5] The next year he contributed \"Magic and Dialect\" to Diogenes (15:80\u20136) where he examines the supposition that \"knowledge of the right name gives power over the bearer of that name\". In 1995 Heinrich Guggenheimer presented his A Scholar\u2019s Haggadah, which makes a bilingual comparison of variances in the traditions of Passover observance. It includes Ashkenazic, Sephardic, and Oriental sources. His study of the Jerusalem Talmud provided text and commentary.[6]\n On 6 June 1947 Heinrich married Eva Auguste Horowitz. Together they wrote Jewish Family Names and their Origins: an Etymological Dictionary (1992).[7] They have two sons, Michael, a professor of Arabic,[8]\u00a0 and Tobias I. S., an architect,[9]\u00a0 and two daughters Dr. Esther Furman, a biochemist,[10] and Hanna Y. Guggenheimer, an artist.\n ", "tags": ["1924 births", "2021 deaths", "German Jews", "Swiss Jews", "Differential geometers", "German emigrants to the United States", "American people of German-Jewish descent", "American people of Swiss-Jewish descent", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Polytechnic Institute of New York University faculty", "Scientists from Nuremberg", "Articles with short description", "Articles with short description added by PearBOT 5", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German-born American mathematician\nHeinrich Walter Guggenheimer (July 21, 1924 \u2013 March 4, 2021 [1]) was a German-born Swiss[2]-American mathematician who has contributed to knowledge in differential geometry, topology, algebraic geometry, and convexity.
