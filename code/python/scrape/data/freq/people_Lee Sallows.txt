{"name": "Lee Sallows", "content": "Lee Cecil Fletcher Sallows (born April 30, 1944) is a British electronics engineer known for his contributions to recreational mathematics.  He is particularly noted as the inventor of golygons, self-enumerating sentences, and geomagic squares.\n Sallows is an expert on the theory of magic squares[1] and has invented several variations on them, including alphamagic squares[2][3] and geomagic squares.[4] The latter invention caught the attention of mathematician Peter Cameron who has said that he believes that \"an even deeper structure may lie hidden beyond geomagic squares\"[5]\n In \"The lost theorem\" published in 1997 he showed that every 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 magic square is associated with a unique parallelogram on the complex plane, a discovery that had escaped all previous researchers from ancient times down to the present day.[6]  In 2014 Sallows discovered a previously unnoticed result involving the\nmedians of a triangle.[7]\n A golygon is a polygon containing only right angles, such that adjacent sides exhibit consecutive integer lengths. Golygons were invented and named by Sallows[8] and introduced by A.K. Dewdney in the Computer Recreations column of the July 1990 issue of Scientific American.[9]\n In 2012 Sallows invented and named self-tiling tile sets\u2014a new generalization of rep-tiles.[10]\n Lee Sallows is the only son of Florence Eliza Fletcher and Leonard Gandy Sallows. He was born on 30 April 1944 at Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire, England, and grew up in the district of Upper Clapton in northeast London. Sallows attended Dame Alice Owen's School, then located at The Angel, Islington, but failed to settle in and was without diplomas when he left at age 17. Knowledge gained via interest in short-wave radio enabled him to find work as a technician within the electronics industry. In 1970 he moved to Nijmegen in the Netherlands, where until 2009, he worked as an electronic engineer at Radboud University. In 1975 Sallows met up with his Dutch partner Evert Lamfers,  a cardiologist,[11] with whom he has lived ever since.\n ", "tags": ["Recreational mathematicians", "Mathematics popularizers", "Combinatorial game theorists", "Magic squares", "People from Nijmegen", "1944 births", "Living people", "CS1 maint: bot: original URL status unknown", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters"], "raw": "Lee SallowsBornApril 30, 1944\u00a0(1944-04-30) (age\u00a076)Welwyn, HertfordshireNationalityEnglishKnown\u00a0forGolygons Alphamagic squares Geometric magic squares Self-tiling tile sets Self-enumerating sentencesScientific careerFieldsRecreational mathematics\n\nLee Cecil Fletcher Sallows (born April 30, 1944) is a British electronics engineer known for his contributions to recreational mathematics.
