His father, David Tamarkin, was a physician and his mother, Sophie Krassilschikov, was from a family of a landowner.  He moved to St. Petersburg as a child and grew up there.  At a gymnasium, he befriended Alexander Friedmann, a future cosmologist, with whom he wrote his first mathematics paper in 1906, and remained friends and colleagues until Friedmann's sudden death in 1925. \nVladimir Smirnov was his other friend from the same gymnasium.  Many years later, they coauthored a popular textbook titled \"A course in higher mathematics\".\n Tamarkin studied in St. Petersburg University where he defended his dissertation in 1917.  His advisor was Andrei Markov.  After the graduation, Tamarkin worked at the Communication Institute and Electrotechnical Institute.  In 1919 he temporarily became a professor and a dean at Perm State University, but a year later returned to St. Petersburg where he received a  professorship at St. Petersburg Polytechnical University.\n In 1925 he became worried about Russia's stability and decided to emigrate to the United States.  His favorite memory was the examination in analytic geometry he had to do with an American consul in Riga, when he tried to prove his identity.[1]  In the U.S., he became a lecturer at Dartmouth College.  In 1927, Tamarkin received a professorship at Brown University where he remained until his retirement in 1945, after suffering a heart attack.  He died later that year in Bethesda, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C.[2]\n Tamarkin's work spanned a number of areas, including number theory, integral equations, Fourier series, complex analysis, moment problem, boundary value problem and differential equations.  He was a proponent and a founding co-editor of the Mathematical Reviews (which was based at Brown at that time), together with Otto Neugebauer and William Feller.[3] He was also an active supporter of the  American Mathematical Society, a member of the council starting 1931, and  a vice-president in 1942\u201343.  He had over twenty doctoral students at Brown, including  Dorothy Lewis Bernstein, Nelson Dunford, George Forsythe, Margaret Gurney and Derrick Lehmer.\n Tamarkin was married to Helene Weichardt (1888\u20131934) who came from a wealthy family of German ancestry. Their son, Paul Tamarkin (1922\u20131977), was a physicist for RAND Corporation.[4]\n ", "tags": ["20th-century Russian mathematicians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "1888 births", "1945 deaths", "People from Chernihiv", "Saint Petersburg State University alumni", "Perm State University faculty", "Brown University faculty", "Dartmouth College faculty", "Russian Social Democratic Labour Party members", "Russian mathematicians", "Soviet mathematicians", "American people of Russian descent", "People from Bethesda, Maryland", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Russian-American mathematician\nJacob TamarkinBorn(1888-07-11)11 July 1888Chernigov, Imperial RussiaDied18 November 1945(1945-11-18) (aged\u00a057)Bethesda, MarylandNationalityRussian AmericanAlma\u00a0materSaint Petersburg State UniversityScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsBrown UniversityDoctoral advisorAndrei MarkovDoctoral students\nDorothy Bernstein\nNelson Dunford\nGeorge Forsythe\nMargaret Gurney\nDerrick Lehmer\nRose Sedgewick\n\n\nJacob David Tamarkin (Russian: \u042f\u0301\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0414\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0301\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0422\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0301\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d, Yakov Davidovich Tamarkin;  11 July 1888 \u2013 18 November 1945) was a Russian-American mathematician best known for his work in mathematical analysis.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Notes\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nTamarkin was born in Chernigov, Imperial Russia (now Chernihiv, Ukraine) to a wealthy Jewish family.
