{"name": "Donald Gibson (architect)", "content": "\n Sir Donald Edward Evelyn Gibson CBE was Coventry\u2019s first City Architect and Planning Officer, from 1938-1954; most famous for the postwar redevelopment of Coventry city centre following the Coventry Blitz.\n Gibson was educated at Manchester Grammar School before attending the Manchester School of Architecture. He spent his fourth year at Harvard,[1] training in Boston, USA,[2] before returning to the UK to qualify in 1932.[1]\n At the age of 29,[3] Gibson was appointed as Coventry\u2019s first City Architect and Planning Officer.\n The re-planning of Coventry City Centre began before the Blitz in 1940-1941; indeed, Gibson produced the initial plan to rebuild part of the city in early 1940, in order to resolve the problems of overcrowding and congestion of the medieval town centre.[4]  It was, however, the extensive wartime damage that enabled the Gibson plan to be turned into reality.[5]\n The Gibson plan involved a re-thinking of the city centre, introducing what was then a brand new town planning concept, with the main premise being a separation of motor traffic and pedestrians.  Such traffic-free shopping precinct was the first in Europe, and was seen as a \"truly pioneering design\" in its day.[6] In addition, Gibson was responsible for the first rooftop parking plus the development of a civic theatre (the Belgrade Theatre) and the circular market.\n The Gibson plan saw extensive consultation with local people, with the \"proposals and suggestions for the physical reconstruction and planning of the City of Coventry\" set out in a book entitled The Future Coventry, published by the Corporation of Coventry.[7]  It was also supported by the Government, where the then Minister of Works, Lord Reith commented, \"Coventry would be a test case, not for me and my authority, but for the Government and for England\".[8]\n Gibson was succeeded by Arthur Ling who was City Architect from 1955 until 1964.\n The redevelopment of the city was featured in a special edition of Architectural Design published in December 1958.[4]\n Gibson left Coventry in 1955, and became County Architect in Nottinghamshire.  Gibson subsequently knighted and became the government\u2019s senior architect, responsible for raising architectural standards.\n Gibson was External Professor of Architecture at the University of Leeds from 1966 to 1968.\n Gibson was awarded the Coventry Award of Merit in 1966.[9]\n He was President of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1964\u201365.\n ", "tags": ["Herbert Art Gallery and Museum", "1908 births", "1991 deaths", "People educated at Manchester Grammar School", "Harvard University alumni", "Academics of the University of Leeds", "20th-century English architects", "Architects from Warwickshire", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Use dmy dates from October 2013", "Use British English from October 2013", "Articles with hCards", "No local image but image on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nSir Donald Edward Evelyn GibsonBorn(1908-10-11)11 October 1908Died22 December 1991(1991-12-22) (aged\u00a083)NationalityBritishOccupationArchitectKnown\u00a0forCity Architect for Coventry\n Sir Donald Gibson, Coventry's City Architect sign, as displayed in Coventry City Centre.\nSir Donald Edward Evelyn Gibson CBE was Coventry\u2019s first City Architect and Planning Officer, from 1938-1954; most famous for the postwar redevelopment of Coventry city centre following the Coventry Blitz.\n\nContents\n\n1 Education\n2 Redevelopment of Coventry\n3 Later career\n4 Awards\n5 References\n\n\nEducation[edit]\nGibson was educated at Manchester Grammar School before attending the Manchester School of Architecture.
