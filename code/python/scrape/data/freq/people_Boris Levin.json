{"name": "Boris Levin", "content": "Boris Yakovlevich Levin (Russian: \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u042f\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d, 22 December 1906 \u2013 24 August 1993) was a Soviet mathematician who made significant contributions to function theory.\n Boris Yakovlevich Levin was born 22 December 1906 in Odessa.[1]\n In 1932 he graduated from the University of North Caucasus (Rostov-on-Don). From 1935 to 1949 he is Professor and Head of the Department of Mathematics of the Odessa Institute of Marine Engineers.\n In 1949, invited by N. I. Akhiezer, he moved to Kharkov, and since that time he worked at the Kharkov State University.[2]\n In 1969 he organized the Department of Function Theory in the Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering of Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, in which he worked until his last days (as a Chief of the Department he worked until 1986).\n Levin died in Moscow on 24 August 1993, at the age of 86.[3]\n Research of B.Ya. Levin is concerned to the theory of entire functions, functional analysis, harmonic analysis, the theory of almost periodic and quasi-analytic functions. He obtained the fundamental results concerning non-harmonic Fourier series and operators preserving inequalities in various classes of entire functions of exponential type. Together with N.I. Akhiezer, he discovered a relation between extremal problems of the theory of entire functions and conformal transformations onto canonical domains. He introduced a class of operators of transformation, which is the basis for solving the inverse scattering problem.\n The theory of entire functions of completely regular growth brought fame to Boris Yakovlevich Levin. He created this theory in the mid of 1930s concurrently with Albert Pfluger. This theory describes a very wide class of entire functions, containing the majority of entire functions encountered in applications. For the functions of this class, the relation between their behaviour at infinity and distribution of zeros can be described by the asymptotic formulas.\n In 1956, Boris Yakovlevich had published his monograph \"Distribution of zeros of entire functions\", which was translated into German and English, and which is, to present days, the handbook for many professionals working in different areas of mathematics.\n In the same year, Boris Yakovlevich organized the seminar in Kharkiv University. For almost 40 years it was a school for Kharkov's mathematicians working in the field of Analysis, as well as it was the center of mathematical research. Boris Yakovlevich had always been proud of achievements of seminar's participants.\n In 1997 a Boris Levin memorial conference \"Entire Functions in Modern Analysis\" was held at the Tel-Aviv University.[4]\nIn September 1997 an international seminar dedicated to the memory of Boris Levin was organized by \nInstitute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering.\n[5]\nIn 2006 an international conference dedicated to the centennial of Boris Levin's birthday took place in Kharkov.[6]\n ", "tags": ["Soviet mathematicians", "20th-century mathematicians", "1906 births", "1993 deaths", "Ukrainian mathematicians", "Odessa Jews", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "In this Eastern Slavic name, the patronymic is  Yakovlevich and the family name is  Levin.\nBoris LevinBornBoris Yakovlevich Levin(1906-12-22)22 December 1906Odessa, Russian EmpireDied24 August 1993(1993-08-24) (aged\u00a086)Moscow, Russian FederationScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsB Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering\n\nBoris Yakovlevich Levin (Russian: \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u042f\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d, 22 December 1906 \u2013 24 August 1993) was a Soviet mathematician who made significant contributions to function theory.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Scientific interests\n3 Bibliography\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nBoris Yakovlevich Levin was born 22 December 1906 in Odessa.[1]\nIn 1932 he graduated from the University of North Caucasus (Rostov-on-Don).
