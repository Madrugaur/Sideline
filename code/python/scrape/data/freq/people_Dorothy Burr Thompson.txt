{"name": "Dorothy Burr Thompson", "content": "Dorothy Burr Thompson (August 19, 1900[1] \u2013 May 10, 2001[2]) was an American classical archaeologist and art historian at Bryn Mawr College and a leading authority on Hellenistic terracotta figurines.\n Thompson was the elder of two daughters of a prominent Philadelphia family. Her father was attorney Charles Henry Burr Jr. and her mother was novelist and biographer Anna Robeson Brown. Her grandfather was noted orator and lawyer Henry Armitt Brown. Early in life Thompson studied the Classics, attending Miss Hill's School in Center City, Pa., and The Latin School in Philadelphia. She began her study of Latin at age 9 and ancient Greek at 12.\n At age 13, she took a Grand Tour of Europe, visiting museums and monuments of Europe. In 1919 she began her studies at Bryn Mawr College where she took courses with Rhys Carpenter and Mary Hamilton Swindler. She graduated summa cum laude in 1923, the first graduate with a major in Greek and archaeology, and was awarded the college's European Fellowship. She used the fellowship to study at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, works on excavations with Carl Blegen at Phlius.\n In 1925 Thompson discovered a tholos tomb that proved to be the burial place of the king and queen of Midea. She completed her Ph.D. at Bryn Mawr College in 1931; it entailed a study of the 117 Hellenistic terracotta figures from Myrina in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n In 1932 Thompson was appointed the first female Fellow of the Athenian Agora excavations.[3]\n The dig's assistant director of field work was the Canadian archaeologist Homer Thompson; the two married in 1934. Homer Thompson accepted positions as curator of the classical collection at the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology and assistant professor in fine arts at the University of Toronto. Burr Thompson had three daughters between 1935 and 1938,[3] but found time to remain involved during the same period in the Athenian Agora excavations, where she discovered the garden of the Temple of Hephaistos in 1936.[4]\n In 1946 her husband accepted a chair at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and Burr Thompson served as acting director of the Royal Ontario Museum until she moved to Princeton, New Jersey the following year. At Princeton she continued to publish and carry out her research. She published the book An Ancient Shopping Center: The Athenian Agora in 1971.[2] In 1987 she was awarded the Gold Medal for distinguished achievement by the Archaeological Institute of America. She died in Hightstown, New Jersey[5] and is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery.\n ", "tags": ["1900 births", "2001 deaths", "American archaeologists", "American centenarians", "Bryn Mawr College alumni", "American School of Classical Studies at Athens", "Women art historians", "American art historians", "American women archaeologists", "Members of The Archaeology Club", "Disease-related deaths in New Jersey", "20th-century American women writers", "American women historians", "Women centenarians", "Articles needing additional references from April 2018", "All articles needing additional references", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.
