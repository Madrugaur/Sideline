{"name": "William Lee (inventor)", "content": "\nWilliam Lee (1563\u20131614) was an English clergyman[1][a] and inventor who devised the first stocking frame knitting machine in 1589, the only one in use for centuries. Its principle of operation remains in use.[2]\n Lee was born in the village of Calverton, Nottinghamshire. He entered Christ's College, Cambridge in 1579 as a sizar and graduated from St. John's College in 1582.[3]\n Lee was a curate at Calverton when he is said to have developed the machine because a woman whom he was courting showed more interest in knitting than in him (or alternatively that his wife was a very slow knitter). His first machine produced a coarse wool, for stockings. Refused a patent by Queen Elizabeth I, he built an improved machine that increased the number of needles per inch from 8 to 20 and produced a silk of finer texture, but the queen again denied him a patent because of her concern for the employment security of the kingdom's many hand knitters whose livelihood might be threatened by such mechanization.  The queen said to Lee:  \"Thou aimest high, Master Lee. Consider thou what the invention could do to my poor subjects.  It would assuredly bring to them ruin by depriving them of employment, thus making them beggars.\"[4]  Most likely the Queen\u2019s concern was a manifestation of the hosiers\u2019 guilds' fear that the invention would make the skills of its artisan members obsolete.[2]\n He entered into a partnership agreement with one George Brooke on 6 June 1600, but the unfortunate Brooks was arrested on a charge of treason and executed in 1603.[5] Eventually, he moved to France with his brother James, taking 9 workmen and 9 frames. He found better support from the Hugenot Henry IV of France, who granted him a patent. Lee began stocking manufacture in Rouen, France, and prospered until, shortly before Henry's assassination in 1610,[2] he signed a contract with Pierre de Caux to provide knitting machines for the manufacture of silk and wool stockings. But the climate changed abruptly on the king's death and despite moving to Paris, his claims were ignored and he died in distress in 1614.\n After Lee's death, his brother James returned to England and disposed of most of the frames in London before moving to Thoroton, near Nottingham where Lee's apprentice John Aston (or Ashton), a miller, had continued to work on the frame and produced a number of improvements. This led to the establishment of two knitting centres, one in London and one in Nottingham. During the 18th century Leicester vied with Nottingham for leadership of the industry in the English East Midlands.[6]\n \nAlthough the industry took nearly a century to develop in wool, silk and lace, the machinery that he developed remained the backbone for far longer and this is reflected in his appearance in the coat of arms of The Worshipful Company of Framework Knitters.  The Quatercentenary of the invention was celebrated in 1989 by the publication of a book of historical studies.[7]\n ", "tags": ["1560s births", "1614 deaths", "16th-century English Anglican priests", "17th-century English clergy", "Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge", "English inventors", "People from Calverton, Nottinghamshire", "People in knitting", "Textile workers", "Articles incorporating Cite DNB template", "CS1: long volume value", "Use dmy dates from October 2019", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "\nWilliam Lee (1563\u20131614) was an English clergyman[1][a] and inventor who devised the first stocking frame knitting machine in 1589, the only one in use for centuries.

Hills 1989 also doubts much of what is recorded about Lee's life and history, but that he invented the framework stocking knitter in 1589 is not in doubt\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Lee, Sidney, ed.
