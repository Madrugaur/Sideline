He is a grandnephew of a Marshal of the Soviet Union Andrey Yeryomenko.\n Eremenko was born into a medical family. His father Emmanuel Berger was a pathophysiologist, professor and head of the Department of pathophysiology at Ternopil National Medical University. His mother Neonila Eremenko was an ophthalmologist. He obtained his master's degree from Lviv University in 1976 and worked in the Institute of Low temperature physics and Engineering in Kharkiv until 1990. He received his PhD from Rostov State University in 1979 (Asymptotic Properties of Meromorphic and Subharmonic Functions), and is currently a distinguished professor at Purdue University.[2]\n In complex dynamics, Eremenko explored escaping sets at the iteration of entire, transcendent functions and conjectured that the connected components of this escaping set are unbounded (Eremenko's conjecture). The conjecture is still open.\n Eremenko was a recipient of the Humboldt Prize in Mathematics.
