She is a CNRS directrice de recherches in mathematics at \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon. In 2012 she received one of the ten prizes of the European Mathematical Society.\n In a 2011 interview, Morel credited a math magazine bought while in 9th grade as well as summer camps for developing her interest in mathematics[4]  and in a 2012 interview she mentioned being a keen distance runner.[5]\nShe studied in Paris at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, graduating in 1999.[6] In 2005 she finished her Ph.D. at the University of Paris-Sud, under the supervision of G\u00e9rard Laumon.[5][6] Her thesis made progress on the Langlands program.[5]\n After her Ph.D., she was a Clay Research Fellow between 2005 and 2011. In December 2009 she was appointed as a professor of mathematics at Harvard University,[7] becoming the first woman in mathematics to be tenured there.[8] From 2012 to 2020, she was a professor of mathematics in Princeton University, where she was also the Henry Burchard Fine Professor in 2015.[9] Morel moved to \u00c9cole Normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon as an CNRS directrice de recherches in mathematics in 2020.\n She gave an invited talk at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2010, in the \"Number Theory\" section.[10]\nIn 2012 she received one of the prestigious European Mathematical Society Prize for young researchers, and in May 2013 she was announced as the winner of the inaugural 2014 AWM-Microsoft Research Prize in Algebra and Number Theory.[11][6]\n ", "tags": ["20th-century French mathematicians", "21st-century French mathematicians", "Harvard University faculty", "Princeton University faculty", "1979 births", "Living people", "Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand alumni", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni", "Number theorists", "French women mathematicians", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French mathematician\nSophie MorelBorn1979NationalityFranceAlma\u00a0mater\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieureUniversit\u00e9 Paris-SudAwardsEMS Prize (2012)AWM-Microsoft Research Prize (2014)[1]Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutions\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de LyonPrinceton UniversityHarvard UniversityDoctoral advisorG\u00e9rard Laumon[2]\n\nSophie Morel (born 1979)[3] is a French mathematician, specializing in number theory.
