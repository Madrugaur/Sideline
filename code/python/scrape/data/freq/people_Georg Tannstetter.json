{"name": "Georg Tannstetter", "content": "Georg Tannstetter (April 1482 \u2013 26 March 1535), also called Georgius Collimitius, was a humanist teaching at the University of Vienna. He was a medical doctor, mathematician, astronomer, cartographer, and the personal physician of the emperors Maximilian I and Ferdinand I. He also wrote under the pseudonym of \"Lycoripensis\".[1] His Latin name \"Collimitius\" is derived from limes meaning \"border\" and is a reference to his birth town: \"Rain\" is a German word for border or boundary.\n Born in Rain am Lech in the Duchy of Bavaria, he studied in Ingolstadt. In 1503, he followed a call of Conrad Celtis to the University of Vienna, where he taught mathematics. He soon became a leading figure amongst the humanists in Vienna. In 1510, he became the personal physician of emperor Maximilian I, who would six years later ennoble him with the predicate \"von Thanau\".\n He travelled with his student Joachim Vadian to Buda in 1518. After his earlier work in c. 1527 he edited a map of Hungary, today known as Tabula Hungariae, from the manuscript of Lazarus Secretarius, a Hungarian clerk. The map was published by Johannes Cuspinianus, printed 1528 in Ingolstadt by Petrus Apianus; its unique copy is in the National Library of Hungary. It is generally praised for its details (c. 1300 settlements) and the relative accuracy of the distances between the settlements. It was one of the first regional maps, included a scale but the manuscript was seriously reshaped, so it is uneasy to recognize the geography of Hungary. Tannstetter is also considered a pioneer of the history of science with his work Viri Mathematici, containing biographies of mathematicians at the University of Vienna from the 15th century.\n In 1530, he moved to Ferdinand's court at Innsbruck, where he died five years later.\n ", "tags": ["1482 births", "1535 deaths", "16th-century German mathematicians", "16th-century Austrian people", "16th-century German physicians", "16th-century Austrian physicians", "German cartographers", "German astronomers", "German Renaissance humanists", "Austrian Renaissance humanists", "German emigrants to Austria", "People from Rain, Swabia", "Physicians from Innsbruck", "16th-century German writers", "16th-century male writers", "Scientists from Vienna", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": " Portrait ca. 1515, by Bernhard Strigel (1460\u00a0\u2013 1528)\nGeorg Tannstetter (April 1482 \u2013 26 March 1535), also called Georgius Collimitius, was a humanist teaching at the University of Vienna.
