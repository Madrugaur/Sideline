He studied in Paris in the 1930s, at the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure d'Electricit\u00e9, Institut de Statistique, and, finally, at the Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9. His work was carried out in wartime England in the 1940s, while employed at the de Havilland Aircraft company. \n Moyal was a professor of mathematics at the former School of Mathematics and Physics of Macquarie University,[6] where he was a colleague of John Clive Ward.  Previously, he had worked at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois.[2]\n He published pioneering work on stochastic processes.[1]\n Moyal was married to Susanna Pollack (1912-2000), with whom he had two children, Orah Young (born in Tel Aviv) and David Moyal (born in Belfast). They divorced in 1956.[7] He was married to Ann Moyal from 1962 until his death.\n \n This article about an Australian scientist is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.
