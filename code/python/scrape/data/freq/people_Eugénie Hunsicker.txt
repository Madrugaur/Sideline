She went to Haverford College, where she was mentored by mathematician Curtis Greene, including two summers of mathematical research with Greene.[2] She also visited the University of Oxford as an exchange student, and earned an honorable mention for the 1992 Alice T. Schafer Prize for excellence in mathematics by an undergraduate woman, won that year by Zvezdelina Stankova.[3] Hunsicker graduated from Haverford magna cum laude in 1992, and went on to graduate study at the University of Chicago, supported in part by a fellowship from the American Association of University Women.[4] Her 1999 dissertation, L(2)-Cohomology and L(2)-Harmonic Forms for Complete Noncompact K\u00e4hler and Warped Product Metrics, was jointly supervised by Melvin G.
