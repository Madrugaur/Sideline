{"name": "John Loudon McAdam", "content": "\n John Loudon McAdam (23 September 1756[1]\u00a0\u2013 26 November 1836) was a Scottish civil engineer and road-builder. He was the inventor of \"macadamisation\", an effective and economical method of constructing roads.\n McAdam was born in Ayr, Scotland.[2] He was the youngest of ten children and second son of the Baron of Waterhead. He moved to Lagwine at Carsphairn when still a child to live with his grandparents. The family name was traditionally McGregor, but was changed to McAdam (claiming descent from the Biblical Adam) for political reasons in James VI's reign.[3]\n He moved to New York in 1770 and, as a merchant and prize agent during the American Revolution, made his fortune working at his uncle William McAdam's counting house.[4] He returned to Scotland in 1783 and purchased an estate at Sauchrie, Ayrshire.[4]\n Besides taking part in local Ayrshire affairs, McAdam operated the Kaims Colliery. The colliery supplied coal to the British Tar Company, of Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald, and partners in the coal tar trade; McAdam ran its kilns. He further was involved in the ironworks at Muirkirk, which was a customer for the coke byproduct of the tar business. This business connection is the only direct relationship of McAdam and tar.[5]\n McAdam became a trustee of the Ayrshire Turnpike in 1783 and became increasingly involved with day-to-day road construction over the next 10 years. In 1802 he moved to Bristol, England and he became general surveyor for the Bristol Corporation in 1804. He put forward his ideas in evidence to Parliamentary enquiries in 1810, 1819 and 1823.[3] In two treatises written in 1816 and 1819 (Remarks on the Present System of Road-Making and Practical Essay on the Scientific Repair and Preservation of Roads) he argued that roads needed to be raised above the surrounding ground and constructed from layered rocks and gravel in a systematic manner.\n McAdam had also been appointed surveyor to the Bristol Turnpike Trust in 1816, where he decided to remake the roads under his care with crushed stone bound with gravel on a firm base of large stones.[6] A camber, making the road slightly convex, ensured rainwater rapidly drained off the road rather than penetrate and damage the road's foundations. This construction method, the greatest advance in road construction since Roman times, became known as \"macadamisation\", or, more simply, \"macadam\".\n The macadam method spread very quickly across the world. The first macadam road in North America, the National Road, was completed in the 1830s and most of the main roads in Europe were subject to the McAdam process by the end of the nineteenth century.[7]\n Although McAdam was paid \u00a35,000 for his Bristol Turnpike Trust work and made \"Surveyor-General of Metropolitan Roads\" in 1820, professional jealousy cut a \u00a35,000 grant for expenses from the Parliament of the United Kingdom to \u00a32,000 in 1827.[8] His efficient road-building and management work had revealed the corruption and abuse of road tolls by unscrupulous turnpike trusts, many of which were run at a deliberate loss despite high toll receipts.[citation needed]\n McAdam died in Moffat, Dumfriesshire, while returning to his home in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, from his annual summer visit to Scotland. His three sons, and in turn four grandsons, followed him into the profession and assisted with the management of turnpike trusts around the country. His second surviving son, James Nicoll McAdam, the \"Colossus of Roads\", was knighted for managing turnpike trusts: a knighthood, it is said, previously offered to his father but declined:(.[2]\n \n ", "tags": ["People from South Ayrshire", "People of the Industrial Revolution", "Scottish civil engineers", "Scottish engineers", "Scottish inventors", "Scottish non-fiction writers", "1756 births", "1836 deaths", "People from Hoddesdon", "People from Maybole", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the ODNB", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles lacking in-text citations from March 2010", "All articles lacking in-text citations", "Use British English from October 2012", "Use dmy dates from February 2021", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from January 2020", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Open Library ID different from Wikidata", "Articles with Open Library links", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Scottish engineer and road-builder\nFor other people named John McAdam, see John McAdam (disambiguation).\nThis article includes a list of general references, but it remains largely unverified because it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations.
