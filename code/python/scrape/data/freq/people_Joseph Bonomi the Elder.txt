{"name": "Joseph Bonomi the Elder", "content": "Joseph Bonomi the Elder ARA (19 January 1739\u00a0\u2013 9 March 1808) was an Italian architect and draughtsman who spent most of his career in England where he became a successful designer of country houses.\n He was born Giuseppe Bonomi in Rome[1] on 19 January 1739. He was educated at the Collegio Romano and then studied architecture with Girolamo Teodoli.[2] He made his early reputation in Rome before moving to London in 1767 at the invitation of Robert and James Adam,[2] who employed him as a draughtsman from 1768.[1] In his early years in England Bonomi also worked as an assistant to Thomas Leverton.[3]\n He became a close friend of the painter Angelica Kauffman, whose cousin Rosa Florini he married in 1775. The next year he produced a design for a proposed sacristy for St Peter's in Rome, which may indicate that he visited his native city at around this time.[2] In 1783 Kauffman persuaded Bonomi to move back to Rome, where she was now living. He took his wife and children with him, and the move seems to have been intended to be permanent; however the next year the family returned to London, where Bonomi was to remain based for the rest of his life.[2]\n Bonomi's earliest known independent work dates from 1784. After this he quickly became a successful designer of country houses.[3] In 1789, he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, and from then on constantly exhibited architectural drawings. Joshua Reynolds, president of the Academy, had wanted Bonomi to become a full Academician, regarding him as a suitable candidate for the vacant chair of perspective; the majority of the Academicians were, however, opposed to this suggestion, and Bonomi became an associate only, and that merely through the president's deciding vote.[4] Reynolds resigned his presidency in protest, but was soon re-elected.[2]\n In 1804 he was appointed architect of St. Peter's at Rome,[1]\n[4] apparently as an honorary position.[2][5]\n He died in London on 9 March 1808, aged 69, and was buried in the Marylebone Cemetery.[2]\n In 1775 he married Rosa Florini, Angelica Kauffman's cousin.[1] One son Ignatius Bonomi (1787\u20131870), was also an architect, and another, Joseph Bonomi the Younger (1796\u20131878), became an eminent sculptor, artist and Egyptologist.\n \nIn a paper read at the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1869, Wyatt Papworth summarised Bonomi's approach:  The style adopted by him was the Italian or modernised Roman; and he sought to obtain the characteristic effect appropriate to the object of his design, rather by just proportions and good details than by unnecessary ornamentation and littleness of parts, thus exhibiting his preference for the \"Architecturesque\" over the \"Picturesque.\"[2]  He took a bold approach to Classical architecture, and was prepared to break its accepted rules by, for instance, omitting the frieze from an entablature, or supporting a portico on an odd number of columns.[3] A favourite innovation was to project the main portico of a house deep enough to form a porte coch\u00e8re (i.e. a shelter for carriages ).[2][3]\n Notable works include:\n Bonomi is briefly mentioned in Sense and Sensibility. In the novel, Robert Ferrars says to Elinor (perhaps untruthfully) that his friend Lord Courtland had shown him three house designs by Bonomi and asked him to choose between them, but that Robert had burned them and advised Courtland to build a cottage instead.\n ", "tags": ["Artists from Rome", "1739 births", "1808 deaths", "18th-century English architects", "18th-century Italian architects", "Architects from Lazio", "Italian draughtsmen", "Italian emigrants to the Kingdom of Great Britain", "Associates of the Royal Academy", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from The American Cyclopaedia", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from The American Cyclopaedia with a Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " The Blickling pyramid\nJoseph Bonomi the Elder ARA (19 January 1739\u00a0\u2013 9 March 1808) was an Italian architect and draughtsman who spent most of his career in England where he became a successful designer of country houses.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Family\n3 Architectural style\n4 Works\n5 Literature\n6 Notes\n7 References\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nHe was born Giuseppe Bonomi in Rome[1] on 19 January 1739.
