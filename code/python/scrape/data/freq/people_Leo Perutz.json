{"name": "Leo Perutz", "content": "Leopold Perutz (2 November 1882, Prague \u2013 25 August 1957, Bad Ischl) was an Austrian novelist and mathematician. He was born in Prague (now capital of the Czech Republic) and was thus a citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He lived in Vienna until the Nazi Anschluss in 1938, when he emigrated to Palestine.\n According to the biographical note on the Arcade Publishing editions of the English translations of his novels, Leo was a mathematician who formulated an algebraic equation which is named after him; he worked as a statistician for an insurance company. He was related to the biologist Max Perutz.[1]\n During the 1950s he returned occasionally to Austria, spending the summer and autumn months in the market town of St. Wolfgang in the Salzkammergut resort region and in Vienna. He died in the Austrian spa town of Bad Ischl in 1957. He wrote his first novel, The Third Bullet, in 1915 while recovering from a wound sustained in the First World War. In all Perutz wrote eleven novels, which gained the admiration of Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, Ian Fleming, Karl Edward Wagner and Graham Greene. Wagner cited Perutz' novel The Master of the Day of Judgement as one of the thirteen best non-supernatural horror novels.[2]\n Perutz was born in Prague to a largely non-religious family of Jewish ancestry.[3] They moved to Vienna, where he attended various schools and colleges before studying probability theory, statistics, actuarial science, and economics.[4]\n Perutz' novels are short and are usually historical novels combining fast-paced adventure with a metaphysical twist.\nThey are influenced by the work of E. T. A. Hoffmann, Arthur Schnitzler and Victor Hugo (whose work Perutz\ntranslated into German).[5] Austrian fellow novelist Friedrich Torberg once characterized Perutz' literary style as the possible result of a little infidelity of Franz Kafka and Agatha Christie. The Marquis of Bolibar features the Wandering Jew appearing\nduring Napoleon's campaign in Spain.[6] By Night Under the Stone Bridge is an episodic work whose separate stories are bound together by the illicit love shared, in their dreams, by a Jewish woman and the Emperor Rudolf II. In the posthumously-published Leonardo's Judas, da Vinci's quest for an appropriate face to give the betrayer in his Last Supper is interwoven with the squabble between a usurer and the merchant to whom he owes money. The title of his 1933 novel Saint Peter's Snow (also known in English as The Virgin's Brand), which is set in what was then the present day, refers to a drug which induces religious fervour; the Nazis, understandably, did not care for it. Critic Alan Piper considered it \"a psychological detective story\", although it has varyingly been categorised as science fiction or fantasy.[3] Piper believed that the novel was decades ahead of its time due to the description of a hallucinogenic drug derived from an ergot fungus 10 years before the discovery of LSD.[3] He also thought it astonishing that it discussed the experimental use of this hallucinogen on an isolated village 20 years before the 1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass poisoning, and proposed that ergot was the psychoactive ingredient used in the ancient mystery cults 40 years before this was put forward as a serious proposal.[3] The Master of the Day of Judgement is a decidedly different mystery story about the circumstances surrounding an actor's death in the early twentieth century, and Little Apple concerns a First World War soldier's obsessive quest for revenge.\n In his discussion of German language fantastic literature, critic Franz Rottensteiner describes Perutz as \"undoubtedly the finest fantasy author of his time\".[6] Literary scholar Alan Piper described Perutz's work as typically containing \"an element of the fantastic, with dramatic plots featuring confusing and conflicting interpretations of events\".[3]\n In 1933, Perutz published his novel St Petri-Schnee, which would be published in English in 1935 as The Virgin's Brand.[3]\n (Dates of publication are for the original German-language editions)\n ", "tags": ["1882 births", "1957 deaths", "Writers from Prague", "Czech writers in German", "20th-century mathematicians", "20th-century Austrian novelists", "Austrian mathematicians", "Male novelists", "Austrian fantasy writers", "Austrian horror writers", "Jewish novelists", "Austro-Hungarian writers", "Austro-Hungarian Jews", "Israeli people of Czech-Jewish descent", "Austrian emigrants to Israel", "Mathematicians from Prague", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "20th-century Austrian male writers", "Burials at the Bad Ischl Friedhof", "Articles to be expanded from December 2009", "All articles to be expanded", "Articles needing translation from German Wikipedia", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article may be expanded with text translated from the corresponding article in German.
