The Hindu Makkal Katchi demanded her for an apology and threatened to start agitations. She responded by saying that \"I am not going to answer every Tom, Dick and Harry. Why should I? There is no need at all. Why are they worried about what a woman sports. Don't they have any other worthwhile work?\".[31]\n The Hindu Munnani and the Hindu Makkal Katchi filed several cases against kushbu for accusing the actress that she had disrespected Hindu gods by sitting cross-legged with her slippers in front of the idols of Goddesses Lakshmi, Sarswathy and Parvathy during 'pooja' for the muhurat at Chennai on 22 November 2007.[32][33]\n Khushbu has been a very vocal supporter of the bull-taming sport jallikattu, and has voiced her opinion at various national and international platforms.[34] She even visited a cattle station in Warrnambool, Australia to get a better understanding of how cattle is treated and raised on farms outside India.\n In 2005, she said in an interview that if girls were to have pre-marital sex, they must safe guard themselves and take precautions to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.

She has always maintained that Indian cinema is not just about Bollywood movies.\n In January 2006, in their first Indian edition,[38] Maxim magazine featured a full-page composite photograph with her head pasted onto the body of a model wearing a two piece bikini.
