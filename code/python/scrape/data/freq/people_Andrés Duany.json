{"name": "Andr\u00e9s Duany", "content": "Andr\u00e9s Duany (born September 7, 1949) is an American architect, an urban planner, and a founder of the Congress for the New Urbanism.\n Duany was born in New York City but grew up in Cuba until 1960.[1] He attended The Choate School and Aiglon College and received his undergraduate degree in architecture and urban planning from Princeton University (1971). After a year of study at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he received a master's degree from the Yale School of Architecture (1974).[1]\n In 1977, Duany co-founded the Miami firm Arquitectonica with his wife, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk; Bernardo Fort-Brescia; Laurinda Spear; and Hervin Romney. Arquitectonica became famous for playful Latin-American influenced modernism. The firm's Atlantis Condominium was featured prominently in the opening credits of the television series Miami Vice.\n In 1980, Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk founded Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company (DPZ), based in Miami, Florida.[1] DPZ participated in the New Urbanism, an international urban planning movement opposed to suburban sprawl and urban disinvestment. The firm first received recognition as the designer of new towns such as Seaside, Florida and Kentlands, Maryland. The firm has since completed designs and codes for over three hundred new towns, regional plans, and inner-city revitalization projects. Duany is also considered to be a representative of New Classical Architecture.\n Duany is a co-founder and emeritus board member of the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU), established in 1993.[1] He has co-authored five books: Suburban Nation: The Rise of Sprawl and the Decline of the American Dream; The New Civic Art; The Smart Growth Manual; Garden Cities; and Landscape Urbanism and Its Discontents. Duany has worked as visiting professor at many institutions and holds two honorary doctorates. He is a fellow of the American Institute of Architects and an adjunct professor at the University of Miami.[2]\n Duany and his partner, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, have been awarded several honorary doctorates and awards including the Vincent Scully Prize by the National Building Museum in recognition of their contributions to the American built environment.[3] Duany has been awarded the Brandeis Award for Architecture, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Medal of Architecture, the Arthur Ross Award in Community Planning, the Richard H. Driehaus Prize for Classical Architecture, the Society of American Registered Architects International Award, and the Albert Simons Medal of Excellence, among other awards.\n ", "tags": ["New Urbanism", "Neohistoricist architects", "American urban planners", "Choate Rosemary Hall alumni", "Princeton University School of Architecture alumni", "1949 births", "Living people", "New Classical architects", "Driehaus Architecture Prize winners", "Yale School of Architecture alumni", "21st-century American architects", "Vincent Scully Prize winners", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Andr\u00e9s DuanyAndr\u00e9s DuanyBorn (1949-09-07) September 7, 1949 (age\u00a071)New York CityNationalityUSAOccupationArchitect and urban plannerKnown\u00a0forfounder of the Congress for the New Urbanism\nAmerican architect and urban planner\nAndr\u00e9s Duany (born September 7, 1949) is an American architect, an urban planner, and a founder of the Congress for the New Urbanism.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Awards\n4 Books\n5 References\n6 Further reading\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nDuany was born in New York City but grew up in Cuba until 1960.[1] He attended The Choate School and Aiglon College and received his undergraduate degree in architecture and urban planning from Princeton University (1971).
