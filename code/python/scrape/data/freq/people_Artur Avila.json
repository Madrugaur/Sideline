{"name": "Artur Avila", "content": "\n Artur Avila Cordeiro de Melo (born 29 June 1979) is a Brazilian mathematician naturalized French working primarily on dynamical systems and spectral theory. He is one of the winners of the 2014 Fields Medal,[2] being the first Latin American to win such an award. He has been a researcher at both the IMPA and the CNRS (working a half-year in each one). He has been a professor at the University of Zurich since September 2018. \n At the age of 16, Avila won a gold medal at the 1995 International Mathematical Olympiad[3] and received a scholarship for the Instituto Nacional de Matem\u00e1tica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) to M.S. while still attending high school in Col\u00e9gio de S\u00e3o Bento and Col\u00e9gio Santo Agostinho in Rio de Janeiro.[4] Later he enrolled in the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), earning his B.S in mathematics.[5]\n At the age of 19, Avila began writing his doctoral thesis on the theory of dynamical systems. In 2001 he finished it and received his PhD from IMPA. That same year he moved abroad to France to do postdoctoral research.[6] He works with one-dimensional dynamics and holomorphic functions.[7] Since 2003 he has worked as a researcher for the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in France, later becoming a research director in 2008. His post-doctoral supervisor was Jean-Christophe Yoccoz.[8]\n Much of Artur Avila's work has been in the field of dynamical systems. In March 2005, at age 26, Avila and Svetlana Jitomirskaya proved the \"conjecture of the ten martinis,\" a problem proposed by the American mathematical physicist Barry Simon.[9] Mark Kac promised a reward of ten martinis to whoever solved the problem: whether or not the spectrum of a particular type of operator is a Cantor set, given certain conditions on its parameters. The problem had been unsolved for 25 years when Avila and Jitomirskaya answered it affirmatively.[10][11] Later that year, Avila and Marcelo Viana proved the Zorich\u2013Kontsevich conjecture that the non-trivial Lyapunov exponents of the Teichm\u00fcller flow on the moduli space of Abelian differentials on compact Riemann surfaces are all distinct.[12][13]\n Later, as a research mathematician, he received in 2006 a CNRS Bronze Medal as well as the Salem Prize, and was a Clay Research Fellow. He became the youngest professorial fellow (directeur de recherches) at the CNRS in 2008. The same year, he was awarded one of the ten prestigious European Mathematical Society prizes, and in 2009 he won the Grand Prix Jacques Herbrand from the French Academy of Sciences.[citation needed] In 2017 he gave the \u0141ojasiewicz Lecture (on the \"One-frequency Schr\u00f6dinger operators and the almost reducibility conjecture\") at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w.[14]\n He was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2010.[15]\nIn 2011, he was awarded the Michael Brin Prize in Dynamical Systems.  He received the Early Career Award from the International Association of Mathematical Physics in 2012,[16] TWAS Prize in 2013[17] and the Fields Medal in 2014.[18]\n He was elected a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in April 2019.[19]\n Avila is a member of World Minds.\n ", "tags": ["1979 births", "Living people", "21st-century French mathematicians", "Fields Medalists", "International Mathematical Olympiad participants", "Mathematical analysts", "People from Rio de Janeiro (city)", "Members of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences", "Recipients of the Legion of Honour", "Dynamical systems theorists", "Instituto Nacional de Matem\u00e1tica Pura e Aplicada alumni", "Instituto Nacional de Matem\u00e1tica Pura e Aplicada researchers", "Brazilian expatriate academics", "French people of Brazilian descent", "21st-century Brazilian mathematicians", "TWAS laureates", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "CS1 Portuguese-language sources (pt)", "Use dmy dates from August 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from April 2016", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThis name uses Portuguese naming customs: the first or maternal family name is Avila and the second or paternal family name is Cordeiro de Melo.\nArtur AvilaAvila at the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach in 2012.BornArtur Avila Cordeiro de Melo (1979-06-29) 29 June 1979 (age\u00a041)Rio de Janeiro, BrazilCitizenshipBrazilFrance[1]EducationInstituto Nacional de Matem\u00e1tica Pura e Aplicada (PhD and MS)  Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (BS)Known\u00a0forDynamical systemsSpectral theoryZorich\u2013Kontsevich conjectureTen martini problemAwardsFields Medal (2014)TWAS Prize (2013)Michael Brin Prize in Dynamical Systems (2011)EMS Prize (2008)Salem Prize (2006)Gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad (1995)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of ZurichIMPA, CNRSParis Diderot University (Paris 7)Instituto Nacional de Matem\u00e1tica Pura e AplicadaThesisBifurca\u00e7\u00f5es de tranforma\u00e7\u00f5es unimodais sob os pontos de vistas topol\u00f3gico e m\u00e9trico\u00a0(2001)Doctoral advisorWelington de Melo\n\nArtur Avila Cordeiro de Melo (born 29 June 1979) is a Brazilian mathematician naturalized French working primarily on dynamical systems and spectral theory.
