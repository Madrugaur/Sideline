His mother was Fanny Schwartz Tolm\u00e9.[1] The family later moved to Bremen, where his father died early (in 1864).\n In 1880, he received his Ph.D. in mathematics at Berlin, where he studied under Karl Weierstrass.  In 1886, he became a professor at the Technische Hochschule Hannover in Hanover, Germany.\n His interests included mathematics, spectroscopy, geodesy, and astrophysics.  In addition to pure mathematics, he did  experimental work studying spectral lines of various elements (together with Heinrich Kayser), and was very interested in the application of this work to astronomical spectroscopy.\n In 1904, on the initiative of Felix Klein he received a call to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, which he accepted. There he remained until his retirement in 1925.\n His daughter Iris also became a mathematician and his son Wilhelm was an early developer of radar. Another of his daughters, Nerina (Nina), married the mathematician Richard Courant.\n The crater Runge on the Moon is named after him.\nThe Schumann-Runge bands of molecular oxygen are named after him and  Victor Schumann\n ", "tags": ["1856 births", "1927 deaths", "University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty", "19th-century German mathematicians", "German physicists", "Numerical analysts", "People from Bremen", "Spectroscopists", "University of Hanover faculty", "Humboldt University of Berlin alumni", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Carl RungeCarl David Tolm\u00e9 RungeBorn(1856-08-30)30 August 1856Bremen, German ConfederationDied3 January 1927(1927-01-03) (aged\u00a070)G\u00f6ttingen, Weimar RepublicCitizenshipGermanAlma\u00a0materBerlin UniversityKnown\u00a0forRunge\u2013Kutta methodRunge's phenomenonLaplace\u2013Runge\u2013Lenz vectorScientific careerFieldsMathematicsPhysicsInstitutionsLeibniz University Hannover (1886\u20131904)University of G\u00f6ttingen (1904\u20131925)Doctoral advisorKarl WeierstrassErnst KummerDoctoral studentsMax BornFriedrich Adolf WillersHermann K\u00f6nig\n\nCarl David Tolm\u00e9 Runge (German: [\u02c8\u0281\u028a\u014b\u0259]; 30 August 1856 \u2013 3 January 1927) was a German mathematician, physicist, and spectroscopist.\nHe was co-developer and co-eponym of the Runge\u2013Kutta method (German pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0280\u028a\u014b\u0259 \u02c8k\u028ata]), in the field of what is today known as numerical analysis.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and work\n\n1.1 Family\n\n\n2 Honors\n3 See also\n4 Works\n5 Bibliography\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nLife and work[edit]\nRunge spent the first few years of his life in Havana, where his father Julius Runge was the Danish consul.
