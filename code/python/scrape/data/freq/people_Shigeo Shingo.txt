{"name": "Shigeo Shingo", "content": "Shigeo Shingo (\u65b0\u90f7 \u91cd\u592b, Shing\u014d Shigeo, 1909\u20131990), born in Saga City, Japan, was a Japanese industrial engineer who was considered as the world\u2019s leading expert on manufacturing practices and the Toyota Production System.\n After having worked as a technician specialized in fusions at the Taiwanese railways in Taipei, at the end of the World War II, in 1945, he started to work at the Japan Management Association (JMA) (ja:\u65e5\u672c\u80fd\u7387\u5354\u4f1a) in Tokyo, becoming a consultant focused on the improvement of factory management. Gathering tips from the improvement experiences in the field he had in 1950 at Toyo Ind. (now Mazda) and in 1957 at the sites in Hiroshima of the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, since 1969 Shing\u014d got involved in some actions in Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) for the reduction of set-up time (change of dies) of pressing machines which took him to the formulation of a specific technique based on operational analysis, which shortened set-up times from 1 to 2 hours (or even half a day) per each exchange of dies to a rapid setting of a few minutes. The method spread out under the English denomination Single Minute Exchange of Die, abbreviated as SMED.\n Shingo may well be known better in the West than in Japan, as a result of his meeting Norman Bodek, an American entrepreneur and founder of Productivity Inc. In 1981 Bodek travelled to Japan to learn about the Toyota Production System, coming across books by Shing\u014d, who as an external consultant had been teaching Industrial engineering courses at Toyota since 1955. Since 1947, Shing\u014d had been involved all over Japan in the training of thousands of people, who joined his courses on the fundamental techniques of analysis and improvement of the operational activities in factories (among which the P-Course, or Production Course).[1]\n Shing\u014d had written his Study of the Toyota Production System in Japanese and had it translated into English in 1980. Bodek took as many copies of this book as he could to the USA and arranged to translate Shingo's other books into English, eventually having his original study re-translated. Bodek also brought Shing\u014d to lecture in the USA and developed one of the first Western lean manufacturing consultancy practices with Shing\u014d's support.\n The relevance of his contribution has sometimes been doubted, but it is substantially confirmed by the opinions of his contemporaries,[2] many saw him even as a contributor to the fundamental concepts of TPS, such as Just in time, and the \u201cpull\u201d production system, which were created by Toyota and Mr.Taiichi Ohno and still remain a strong logical and practical basis for the lean production and lean thinking management approaches.\nThe myth prevails that Shingo invented the Toyota Production System but what can be stated is that he did document the system. Shingo contributed to the formalization of some aspects of the management philosophy known as the Toyota Production System (TPS), developed and applied in Japan since the 1950s and later implemented in a huge number of companies in the world.\n In 1988, the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University recognized Dr. Shing\u014d for his lifetime accomplishments and created the Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence that recognizes world-class, lean organizations and operational excellence.\n The theorist of important innovations related to Industrial engineering, such as Poka-yoke and the Zero Quality Control, Shing\u014d could influence fields other than manufacturing.\nFor example, his concepts of SMED, mistake-proofing, and \"zero quality control\" (eliminating the need for inspection of results) have all been applied in the sales process engineering[3]\n Shingo was the author of several books including: A Study of the Toyota Production System; Revolution in Manufacturing: The SMED System; Zero Quality Control: Source Inspection and the Poka-yoke System; The Sayings of Shigeo Shingo: Key Strategies for Plant Improvement; Non-Stock Production: The Shingo System for Continuous Improvement and The Shingo Production Management System: Improving Process Functions.\n \n ", "tags": ["Quality", "Quality experts", "Japanese engineers", "People from Saga (city)", "1909 births", "1990 deaths", "20th-century engineers", "Articles with Japanese-language sources (ja)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Japanese-language text", "Articles with Spanish-language sources (es)", "Articles with German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Japanese engineer\nShigeo Shing\u014dBorn1909Saga, JapanDied1990Tokyo, JapanNationalityJapaneseOther\u00a0namesShing\u014d dai-senseiOccupationManagement trainer and consultant, in Industrial engineering & Business managementKnown\u00a0forSMED, P-Course, Toyota Production System\nShigeo Shingo (\u65b0\u90f7 \u91cd\u592b, Shing\u014d Shigeo, 1909\u20131990), born in Saga City, Japan, was a Japanese industrial engineer who was considered as the world\u2019s leading expert on manufacturing practices and the Toyota Production System.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and work\n2 Education\n3 Bibliography\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 Further reading\n7 External links\n\n\nLife and work[edit]\nAfter having worked as a technician specialized in fusions at the Taiwanese railways in Taipei, at the end of the World War II, in 1945, he started to work at the Japan Management Association (JMA) (ja:\u65e5\u672c\u80fd\u7387\u5354\u4f1a) in Tokyo, becoming a consultant focused on the improvement of factory management.
