{"name": "Christoph Scriba", "content": "Christoph J. Scriba (October 6, 1929 \u2013 July 26, 2013) was a German historian of mathematics.[1]\n Scriba was born in Darmstadt and studied at Justus-Liebig-University Giessen. He read James Gregory's early writings on the calculus with Joseph Ehrenfried Hofmann, and was awarded his doctorate in 1957. Continuing with J.E. Hofmann, and with Bernard Sticker, he investigated the papers of John Wallis in Oxford in 1966, contributing to Studies on the Mathematics of John Wallis.\n Scriba then taught at the University of Kentucky, the University of Massachusetts and at the University of Toronto from 1959 to 1962. He became chairman of Technical University of Berlin's department of History of Mathematics in 1969. Then in 1975 he became Professor of History of Natural Science and Mathematics at the University of Hamburg and Director of the Institute until he retired in 1995. His successor there was Karin Reich.\n Scriba was on the Executive Committee of the International Commission on the History of Mathematics and its president from 1977 to 1985. He was a member of Jungius company in Hamburg, the Leopoldina, the International Academy of the History of Science, and since 1995 the G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences. In 1993 he was awarded the Kenneth O. May Prize of the ICHM. He was the doctorate advisor of Eberhard Knobloch. He died in July 2013 in Hamburg.\n ", "tags": ["20th-century German mathematicians", "Historians of mathematics", "1929 births", "2013 deaths", "German historians of philosophy", "21st-century German mathematicians", "20th-century German historians", "21st-century German historians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from August 2013", "All articles needing additional references", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Mathematician\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
