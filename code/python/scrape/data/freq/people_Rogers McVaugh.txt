He was also Adjunct Research Scientist of the Hunt Institute in Carnegie Mellon University and a Professor Emeritus of botany in the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.[1]\n Born in New York City, Rogers McVaugh was a brilliant student. He earned the bachelor's degree with highest honors in botany from Swarthmore College in 1931 and a Ph.D in botany from the University of Pennsylvania in 1935.[1]\n During his career he held appointments at several universities but spent the majority of his time at the Universities of Michigan (1946 until retirement in 1979) and North Carolina.  He specialised in the Compositae, Myrtaceae, Campanulaceae, woody Rosaceae, and the flora of Mexico, as well as botanical history and nomenclature.[2]\n McVaugh was an expert in the field, especially of neotropical families and collected extensively in western Mexico particularly in the 1930s and 1940s.[3] These are held in several herbaria in the USA, particularly over 23,000 specimens in the Herbarium of the University of Michigan.  Other herbaria with smaller collections include those in University of North Carolina, University of Georgia and University of California.[1]\n McVaugh published about 12 books and 200 shorter articles in history of botany, floristics and systematic botany. These included: \n McVaugh's last, partially completed work was the Flora Novo-Galiciana, a multi-volume work focusing on the diverse flora of this region in western Mexico.\n McVaugh and Ruth Beall were married in 1937. She died in 1987.
