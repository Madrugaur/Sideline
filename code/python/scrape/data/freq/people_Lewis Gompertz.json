{"name": "Lewis Gompertz", "content": "Lewis Gompertz (c.\u20091784[note 1] \u2013 2 December 1861) was an English writer and inventor, early animal rights and veganism advocate, and a founding member, in June 1824, of the English Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, later the RSPCA.[2] He was the younger brother of the mathematician and actuary Benjamin Gompertz[2] and the poet Isaac Gompertz.[2]\n Gompertz was born into a large and wealthy family of London diamond merchants,[3] the fifth son of his father Solomon Barent Gompertz's (1729 \u2013 c.\u20091807) second marriage.[2] Being Jewish, Gompertz and his siblings were not allowed to attend university and instead received an informal education.[3]\n Gompertz was a vegan and opposed to humans intentionally using animals for human interests in any way.[3] He refused to wear leather or silk and declined to ride in coaches due to the suffering of the horses.[4][5] He was the inventor of a multitude of inventions\u2014including the expanding chuck\u2014many of them designed to reduce animal suffering.[6] In 1821, Gompertz invented an improved velocipede, an early form of bicycle. His machine was powered by pulling on the steering handles, which drove a rack and pinion mechanism, which in turn rotated the front wheel.[7]\n He was one of the founding members for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to animals, attending its inaugural meeting in 1824.[3] He published his first book Moral Inquiries on the Situation of Man and of Brutes, in the same year, which laid out his ethical views on animals;[8] the book was also critical of capitalism and the oppression of women and praised Owenism.[2] Gompertz acted as the SPCA's second Honorary Secretary, before resigning in 1833, after the governing committee objected to Gompertz's promotion of \"Pythagorean doctrines\", which held that the feelings of animals and humans were of equal value. The committee had created a resolution that limited membership in the SPCA to Christians. Since Gompertz was a Jew, he was forced to resign.[3]\n Gompertz went on to found the Animals' Friend Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which he ran until 1846, after which he resigned to care for Ann, his terminally ill wife. The society was welcoming to evangelicals and Quakers. His wife died in 1847[9] and he spent the remainder of his life writing and speaking about animal rights and welfare[2][10] and creating inventions.[3] In 1852, he published his second book on animals Fragments in Defence of Animals.[8]\n He died from bronchitis at his home in Kennington, on 2 December 1861[11] and was buried in the graveyard of the local church.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1780s births", "1861 deaths", "19th-century English male writers", "Animal rights activists", "Animal rights scholars", "Anti-vivisectionists", "British anti-capitalists", "Deaths from bronchitis", "English humanitarians", "English inventors", "English Jewish writers", "English Jews", "English people of German-Jewish descent", "Gompertz family", "Jewish English activists", "Jewish inventors", "Organization founders", "People from Hampstead", "Proto-vegans", "Veganism activists", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the ODNB", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Year of birth uncertain"], "raw": "Lewis GompertzBornc.\u20091784Hampstead, EnglandDied2 December 1861\u00a0(1861-12-03) (aged\u00a077)Kennington, EnglandOccupationAnimal rights and veganism activist, inventor, writerSpouse(s)Ann Hollaman\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01809; died\u00a01847)\u200b[1]Family\nBenjamin Gompertz (brother)\nIsaac Gompertz (brother)\n\nLewis Gompertz (c.\u20091784[note 1] \u2013 2 December 1861) was an English writer and inventor, early animal rights and veganism advocate, and a founding member, in June 1824, of the English Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, later the RSPCA.[2] He was the younger brother of the mathematician and actuary Benjamin Gompertz[2] and the poet Isaac Gompertz.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Selected publications\n3 See also\n4 Notes\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nGompertz was born into a large and wealthy family of London diamond merchants,[3] the fifth son of his father Solomon Barent Gompertz's (1729 \u2013 c.\u20091807) second marriage.[2] Being Jewish, Gompertz and his siblings were not allowed to attend university and instead received an informal education.[3]\nGompertz was a vegan and opposed to humans intentionally using animals for human interests in any way.[3] He refused to wear leather or silk and declined to ride in coaches due to the suffering of the horses.[4][5] He was the inventor of a multitude of inventions\u2014including the expanding chuck\u2014many of them designed to reduce animal suffering.[6] In 1821, Gompertz invented an improved velocipede, an early form of bicycle.
