Born in London, England, he was Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the institute for seven years. He currently also serves as Vice-President of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities.\n Harel is best known for his work on dynamic logic, computability, database theory, software engineering and modelling biological systems. In the 1980s he invented the graphical language of Statecharts for specifying and programming reactive systems, which has been adopted as part of the UML standard. Since the late 1990s he has concentrated on a scenario-based approach to programming such systems, launched by his co-invention (with W. Damm) of Live Sequence Charts. He has published expository accounts of computer science, such as his award winning 1987 book \"Algorithmics: The Spirit of Computing\" and his 2000 book \"Computers Ltd.: What They Really Can\u2019t do\", and has presented series on computer science for Israeli radio and television. He has also worked on other diverse topics, such as graph layout, computer science education and the analysis and communication of odors.\n Harel completed his PhD at MIT between 1976 and 1978. In 1987, he co-founded the software company I-Logix, which in 2006 became part of IBM.\n He has advocated building a full computer model of the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode, which was the first multicellular organism to have its genome completely sequenced. The eventual completeness of such a model depends on his updated version of the Turing test.\n He is a fellow of the ACM, the IEEE, the AAAS, and EATCS.\n Harel is active in several peace and human rights organisations in Israel.\n ", "tags": ["1950 births", "Living people", "Mathematicians from London", "Israeli computer scientists", "Israel Prize in computer sciences recipients", "Israeli academics", "Israeli Jews", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science", "Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery", "Fellow Members of the IEEE", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Formal methods people", "Graph drawing people", "Members of Academia Europaea", "Systems biologists", "Software engineering researchers", "Unified Modeling Language", "Weizmann Institute of Science faculty", "Jewish inventors", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Engineering", "CS1 Italian-language sources (it)", "EngvarB from June 2017", "Use dmy dates from June 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nDavid HarelFRSDavid Harel (right) with Carl Hewitt at FLoC 2006Born (1950-04-12) 12 April 1950 (age\u00a070)London, England, UKNationalityIsraeli and BritishAwards\nACM Software System Award\nIsrael Prize\nScientific careerFieldsComputer ScienceInstitutionsWeizmann Institute\n\nDavid Harel (Hebrew: \u05d3\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u200e; born 12 April 1950) is a computer scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and holds the William Sussman Professorial Chair of Mathematics.
