{"name": "Paul Halmos", "content": "Paul Richard Halmos (Hungarian: Halmos P\u00e1l; March 3, 1916 \u2013 October 2, 2006) was a Hungarian-born American mathematician and statistician who made fundamental advances in the areas of mathematical logic, probability theory, statistics, operator theory, ergodic theory, and functional analysis (in particular, Hilbert spaces). He was also recognized as a great mathematical expositor. He has been described as one of The Martians.[1]\n Born in Hungary into a Jewish family, Halmos arrived in the U.S. at 13 years of age. He obtained his B.A. from the University of Illinois, majoring in mathematics, but fulfilling the requirements for both a math and philosophy degree. He took only three years to obtain the degree, and was only 19 when he graduated. He then began a Ph.D. in philosophy, still at the Champaign\u2013Urbana campus; but, after failing his masters' oral exams,[2] he shifted to mathematics, graduating in 1938. Joseph L. Doob supervised his dissertation, titled Invariants of Certain Stochastic Transformations: The Mathematical Theory of Gambling Systems.[3]\n Shortly after his graduation, Halmos left for the Institute for Advanced Study, lacking both job and grant money. Six months later, he was working under John von Neumann, which proved a decisive experience. While at the Institute, Halmos wrote his first book, Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces, which immediately established his reputation as a fine expositor of mathematics.[4]\n From 1967 to 1968 he was the Donegall Lecturer in Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin.\n Halmos taught at Syracuse University, the University of Chicago (1946\u201360), the University of Michigan (~1961\u201367), the University of Hawaii (1967\u201368), Indiana University (1969\u201385), and the University of California at Santa Barbara (1976\u201378). From his 1985 retirement from Indiana until his death, he was affiliated with the Mathematics department at Santa Clara University (1985\u201396).\n In a series of papers reprinted in his 1962 Algebraic Logic, Halmos devised polyadic algebras, an algebraic version of first-order logic differing from the better known cylindric algebras of Alfred Tarski and his students. An elementary version of polyadic algebra is described in monadic Boolean algebra.\n In addition to his original contributions to mathematics, Halmos was an unusually clear and engaging expositor of university mathematics. He won the Lester R. Ford Award in 1971[5] and again in 1977 (shared with W. P. Ziemer, W. H. Wheeler, S. H. Moolgavkar, J. H. Ewing and W. H. Gustafson).[6] Halmos chaired the American Mathematical Society committee that wrote the AMS style guide for academic mathematics, published in 1973. In 1983, he received the AMS's Leroy P. Steele Prize for exposition.\n In the American Scientist 56(4): 375\u2013389, Halmos argued that mathematics is a creative art, and that mathematicians should be seen as artists, not number crunchers. He discussed the division of the field into mathology and mathophysics, further arguing that mathematicians and painters think and work in related ways.\n Halmos's 1985 \"automathography\" I Want to Be a Mathematician is an account of what it was like to be an academic mathematician in 20th century America.  He called the book \"automathography\" rather than \"autobiography\", because its focus is almost entirely on his life as a mathematician, not his personal life.  The book contains the following quote on Halmos' view of what doing mathematics means:\n Don't just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis? \u2014 Paul Halmos, 1985\n In these memoirs, Halmos claims to have invented the \"iff\" notation for the words \"if and only if\" and to have been the first to use the \"tombstone\" notation to signify the end of a proof,[7] and this is generally agreed to be the case.  The tombstone symbol \u220e (Unicode U+220E) is sometimes called a halmos.[8]\n In 2005, Halmos and his wife Virginia funded the Euler Book Prize, an annual award given by the Mathematical Association of America for a book that is likely to improve the view of mathematics among the public. The first prize was given in 2007, the 300th anniversary of Leonhard Euler's birth, to John Derbyshire for his book about Bernhard Riemann and the Riemann hypothesis: Prime Obsession.[9]\n In 2009 George Csicsery featured Halmos in a documentary film also called I Want to Be a Mathematician.[10]\n ", "tags": ["1916 births", "2006 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Algebraists", "American logicians", "American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent", "American statisticians", "Donegall Lecturers of Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin", "Functional analysts", "Hungarian emigrants to the United States", "Hungarian Jews", "Hungarian mathematicians", "Indiana University faculty", "Jewish American scientists", "Mathematical analysts", "Measure theorists", "Operator theorists", "Probability theorists", "Set theorists", "University of Chicago faculty", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign alumni", "University of Michigan faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hungarian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian-American mathematician\n\"Halmos\" redirects here.
