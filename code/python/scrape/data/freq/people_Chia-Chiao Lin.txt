In 1937 Lin graduated from the department of physics, National Tsinghua University in Beijing. \n After graduation he was a teaching assistant in the Tsinghua University physics department. In 1939 Lin won a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship and was initially supported to study in the United Kingdom. However, due to World War II, Lin and several others were sent to North America by ship. Unluckily, Lin's ship was stopped in Kobe, Japan, and all students had to return to China. \n In 1940, Lin finally reached Canada and studied at the University of Toronto from which he earned his M.Sc. In 1941.[citation needed] Lin continued his studies in the United States and received his PhD from the California Institute of Technology in 1944 under Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n. His PhD thesis provided a analytic method to solve a problem in the stability of parallel shearing flows, which was the subject of Werner Heisenberg's PhD thesis.[3]\n Lin also taught at Caltech between 1943 and 1945. He taught at Brown University between 1945 and 1947. Lin joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1947. Lin was promoted to professor at MIT in 1953 and became an Institute Professor of MIT in 1963. He was President of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics from 1972 to 1974.[4] Lin retired from MIT in 1987.  \n In 2002, he moved back to China and helped found the Zhou Pei-Yuan Center for Applied Mathematics (ZCAM) at Tsinghua University. He died in Beijing in 2013, aged 96.\n During his career Lin has received many prizes and awards, including:\n Lin was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, cited in the American Men and Women of Science. and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Lin was elected Academician of Academia Sinica in 1958, and became a Foreign Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1994.\n ", "tags": ["1916 births", "2013 deaths", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Foreign members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science", "Fellows of the American Physical Society", "Educators from Beijing", "Mathematicians from Beijing", "Chinese emigrants to the United States", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty", "Tsinghua University faculty", "Tsinghua University alumni", "Boxer Indemnity Scholarship recipients", "University of Toronto alumni", "California Institute of Technology alumni", "California Institute of Technology faculty", "Brown University faculty", "Fluid dynamicists", "Members of Academia Sinica", "Presidents of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics", "Florida State University faculty", "CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)", "CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)", "Articles containing Chinese-language text", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing traditional Chinese-language text", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from October 2018", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "The native form of this personal name is Lin Chia-Chiao.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nChia Chiao LinBorn(1916-07-07)7 July 1916Peking, ChinaDied13 January 2013(2013-01-13) (aged\u00a096)Beijing, ChinaNationalityUnited States[1]Alma\u00a0materCalifornia Institute of Technology University of Toronto National Tsinghua UniversityKnown\u00a0forHydrodynamic stability  turbulent flowAwardsFluid Dynamics Prize (1979) Timoshenko Medal (1975)Otto Laporte Award (1973)Scientific careerFieldsApplied MathematicsInstitutionsCaltech Brown University MITThesisInvestigations on the Theory of Turbulence\u00a0(1944)Doctoral advisorTheodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1nDoctoral studentsPhyllis FoxLee SegelFrank ShuDavid Benney\nChinese nameTraditional\u00a0Chinese\u6797\u5bb6\u7ff9Simplified Chinese\u6797\u5bb6\u7fd8TranscriptionsStandard MandarinHanyu PinyinL\u00edn Ji\u0101qi\u00e1oWade\u2013GilesLin2 Chia1-ch'iao2IPA[li\u030cn\u00a0t\u0255ja\u0301t\u0255\u02b0ja\u030cu]\n\n\nChia-Chiao Lin (Chinese: \u6797\u5bb6\u7ff9; 7 July 1916\u00a0\u2013 13 January 2013) was a Chinese-born American applied mathematician and Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[2]\nLin made major contributions to the theory of hydrodynamic stability, turbulent flow, mathematics, and astrophysics.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Honors and awards\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nLin was born in Beijing with ancestral roots in Fuzhou.
