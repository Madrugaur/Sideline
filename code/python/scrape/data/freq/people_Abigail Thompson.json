{"name": "Abigail Thompson", "content": "Abigail A. Thompson (born 1958 in Norwalk, Connecticut)[1] is an American mathematician. She works as a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Davis, where she specializes in knot theory and low-dimensional topology.[2]\n Thompson graduated from Wellesley College in 1979,[1] and earned her Ph.D. in 1986 from Rutgers University under the joint supervision of Martin Scharlemann and Julius L.
