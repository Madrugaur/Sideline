{"name": "Malgorzata Dubiel", "content": "Malgorzata Dubiel is a Polish mathematician and mathematics educator who works as a senior lecturer at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada.[1]\n Dubiel is the daughter of a Polish military rocket scientist and engineer.[2]\nShe has a Ph.D. from the University of Warsaw, supervised by theoretical computer scientist and mathematical logician Victor W. Marek.[3] In 1982, she moved to Canada.\n At Simon Fraser, her courses include classes for future mathematics teachers, and remedial mathematics classes for students who did poorly in high school mathematics.[2]\nShe was president of the Simon Fraser University Faculty Association for two terms from 1994 to 1996, and again from 2004 to 2005.[4]\n Dubiel is known for her studies of Canadian primary and secondary school mathematics textbooks, and for pointing out problems in these texts caused in part because they were written by education professionals without consulting any mathematicians.[5][6] Although she values creativity imagination in mathematics, and uses it in her own lessons,[7] she has also stated that it \"must not come at the expense of basic math skills, clear instructions and practice\".[8]\n She has also served as president of the Canadian Math Education Study Group and co-chair in 2009 of the Canadian Mathematics Education Forum. She is the founder of an annual mathematics workshop for female graduate students in mathematics, Connecting Women in Mathematics Across Canada.
