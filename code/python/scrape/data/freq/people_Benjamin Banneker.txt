Born in Baltimore County, Maryland, to a free African-American woman and a former slave, Banneker had little or no formal education and was largely self-taught. He became known for assisting Major Andrew Ellicott in a survey that established the original borders of the District of Columbia, the federal capital district of the United States.\n Banneker's knowledge of astronomy helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with Thomas Jefferson on the topics of slavery and racial equality, Jefferson having earlier drafted the United States Declaration of Independence. Abolitionists and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n Although a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining artifacts are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes commemorate him and his works. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate his accomplishments or attribute to him the achievements of others.\n Benjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland, to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a freed slave from Guinea who died in 1759.[2][3] There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.\n Banneker himself and his earliest biographers described him as having only African ancestry.[4][5][6] None of Banneker's surviving papers describe a white ancestor or identify the name of his grandmother.[5]\n However, later biographers have contended that Banneker's mother was the child of Molly Welsh, a former white indentured servant, and an African slave named Banneka.[3][5][7] The first published description of Molly Welsh was based on interviews with her descendants that took place in 1836, long after the deaths of both Molly and Benjamin.[5][8] According to that story, Molly purchased Banneka to help establish a farm located near the future site of Ellicott's Mills, Maryland, west of Baltimore.[9]\n A biographer suggested in 2002 that Banneka may have been a member of the Dogon people, who several anthropologists have claimed had an early knowledge of astronomy (see Dogon astronomical beliefs).[10] Molly supposedly freed and married Banneka, who may have shared his knowledge of astronomy with her.[11] The biographer suggested that Benjamin acquired this knowledge from Molly, as Benjamin was born after Banneka's death.[10]\n A genealogist who in 2016 reported an analysis of records related to Banneker's family tree was unable to identify any documents that showed that Banneker had a white grandmother, but could not rule out that possibility. The report noted that the name \"Bannaker\" may have had the same origin as that of Banaka, a small village in the present-day Klay District of Bomi County in northwestern Liberia that had once participated in the African slave trade.[3][12]\n In 1737, Banneker was named at the age of 6 on the deed of his family's 100-acre (0.40\u00a0km2) farm in the Patapsco Valley in rural Baltimore County.[13][14][15] A letter writer stated in 1791 that Banneker's parents had sent him to an obscure school where he learned reading, writing and arithmetic as far as double position.[16] However, the remainder of Banneker's early life is not well documented.\n Unverified accounts that first appeared in books published more than 140 years after Banneker's death relate that, as a young teenager, Banneker met and befriended Peter Heinrich, a Quaker who later established a school near the Banneker family farm.[17][18] (Quakers were leaders in the anti-slavery movement and advocates of racial equality (see Quakers in the abolition movement and Testimony of equality)).[19] These accounts state that Heinrich shared his personal library and provided Banneker with his only classroom instruction.[18][20] Banneker's formal education (if any) presumably ended when he was old enough to help on his family's farm.[21]\n Around 1753, at about the age of 21, Banneker reportedly completed a wooden clock that struck on the hour. He appears to have modeled his clock from a borrowed pocket watch by carving each piece to scale. The clock purportedly continued to work until his death.[21][22]\n After his father died in 1759, Banneker lived with his mother and sisters.[2][23] In 1768, he signed a Baltimore County petition to move the county seat from Joppa to Baltimore.[24] An entry for his property in a 1773 Baltimore County tax list identified Banneker as the only adult member of his household.[25]\n In 1772, brothers Andrew Ellicott, John Ellicott and Joseph Ellicott moved from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and bought land along the Patapsco Falls near Banneker's farm on which to construct gristmills, around which the village of Ellicott's Mills (now Ellicott City) subsequently developed.[26][27] The Ellicotts were Quakers who held the same views on racial equality as did many of their faith.[26][28] Banneker studied the mills and became acquainted with their proprietors.[29][30]\n In 1788, George Ellicott, a son of Andrew Ellicott, loaned Banneker books and equipment to begin a more formal study of astronomy.[31][32][33] During the following year, Banneker sent George his work calculating a solar eclipse.[31][32][34]\n In 1790, Banneker prepared an ephemeris for 1791, which he hoped would be placed within a published almanac.[35] However, he was unable to find a printer that was willing to publish and distribute the work.[31][36]\n In early 1791, U.S. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson asked surveyor Major Andrew Ellicott (a son of Joseph Ellicott and a cousin of George Ellicott) to survey an area that would contain a new federal district. In February 1791, Ellicott left a surveying team that had he had been leading in western New York so that he could begin the district's survey. Ellicott then hired Banneker as a replacement to assist in the initial survey of the federal district's boundaries, advancing him $60 for travel expenses to and at Georgetown.[37][38]\n The territory that became the original District of Columbia was formed from land along the Potomac River that the states of Maryland and Virginia ceded to the federal government of the United States in accordance with the 1790 federal Residence Act and later legislation.  The territory was a square that measured 10 miles (16\u00a0km) on each side, totaling 100 square miles (260\u00a0km2) (see: Founding of Washington, D.C.).[37][38][39] Ellicott's team placed boundary marker stones at or near every mile point along the borders of the new capital territory (see: Boundary markers of the original District of Columbia).[37][38]\n Biographers have stated that Banneker's duties on the survey consisted primarily of making astronomical observations and calculations to establish base points, including one at Jones Point in Alexandria, Virginia, where the survey started and where the south corner stone was to be located.[37][40] They have also stated that Banneker maintained a clock that he used to relate points on the ground to the positions of stars at specific times.[31][41]\n However, some have noted that Banneker's actual role in the survey is uncertain, as his involvement in the effort \"rests on extremely meager documentation\".[42][43] An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south corner stone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".[44] The news report did not mention Banneker's name.[45]\n Banneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because the time that he was devoting to the project was conflicting with the time that he had expected to use to calculate an ephemeris for the year of 1792.[46][47] Further, the arrival of spring required him to direct more attention to his farm than was needed during the winter.[47] In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, Benjamin and Joseph Ellicott, who usually assisted Andrew, had completed the New York survey and were able to join the survey of the federal district at around that time.[47]\n Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.[31][47] The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.  The team laid the Maryland stones and completed the boundary survey in 1792.[37][38][48]\n After returning to Ellicott's Mills, Banneker made astronomical calculations that predicted eclipses and planetary conjunctions for inclusion in an almanac and ephemeris for the year of 1792.[2][36][49] To aid Banneker in his efforts to have his almanac published, Andrew Ellicott (who had been authoring almanacs and ephemerides of his own since 1780)[50] forwarded Banneker's ephemeris to James Pemberton, the president of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage.[31][36][51]\n Pemberton then asked William Waring, a Philadelphia mathematician and ephemeris calculator,[52] and David Rittenhouse, a prominent American astronomer, almanac author,[53] surveyor and scientific instrument maker who was at the time serving as the president of the American Philosophical Society,[54] to confirm the accuracy of Banneker's work.[36][55] Waring endorsed Banneker's work, stating, \"I have examined Benjamin Banneker's Almanac for 1792, and am of the Opinion that it well deserves the Acceptance and Encouragement of the Public.\"[56]\n Rittenhouse responded to Pemberton by stating that Banneker's ephemeris \"was a very extraordinary performance, considering the Colour of the Author\" and that he \"had no doubt that the Calculations are sufficiently accurate for the purposes of a common Almanac. .... Every instance of Genius amongst the Negroes is worthy of attention, because their suppressors seem to lay great stress on their supposed inferior mental abilities.\"[57] Banneker reportedly replied to Rittenhouse's endorsement by stating: \"I am annoyed to find that the subject of my race is so much stressed. The work is either correct or it is not. In this case, I believe it to be perfect.\"[58]\n Pemberton then made arrangements for Joseph Crukshank (a Philadelphia Quaker who was a founder of the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery and who had since 1770 been publishing almanacs, including at least one that Waring had calculated) to print Banneker's almanac.[31][59] Having thus secured the support of Pemberton, Rittenhouse and Waring, Banneker delivered a manuscript containing his ephemeris to William Goddard, a Baltimore printer who had published The Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia Almanack and Ephemeris for every year since 1782.[60] Goddard then agreed to print and distribute Banneker's work within an almanac and ephemeris for the year of 1792.[61]\n Banneker's Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia Almanack and Ephemeris, for the Year of our Lord, 1792 was the first in a six-year series of almanacs and ephemerides that printers agreed to publish and sell.[31][36] At least 28 editions of the almanacs, some of which appeared during the same year, were printed in seven cities in five states: Baltimore; Philadelphia; Wilmington, Delaware; Alexandria, Virginia; Petersburg, Virginia; Richmond, Virginia; and Trenton, New Jersey.[31][62][63]\n The title pages of the Baltimore editions of Banneker's 1792, 1793 and 1794 almanacs and ephemerides stated that the publications contained:\n the Motions of the Sun and Moon, the True Places and Aspects of the Planets, the Rising and Setting of the Sun, Place and Age of the Moon, &c. \u2013 The Lunations, Conjunctions, Eclipses, Judgment of the Weather, Festivals, and other remarkable Days; Days for holding the Supreme and Circuit Courts of the United States, as also the useful Courts in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Also \u2013 several useful Tables, and valuable Receipts. \u2013 Various Selections from the Commonplace\u2013Book of the Kentucky Philosopher, an American Sage; with interesting and entertaining Essays, in Prose and Verse \u2013the whole comprising a greater, more pleasing, and useful Variety than any Work of the Kind and Price in North America.[64][65]\n In addition to the information that its title page described, the 1792 almanac contained a tide table for the Chesapeake Bay region.  That edition and others contained tables listing the times of high tides or the methods for calculating high water at Cape Charles and Point Lookout, Virginia, Annapolis and Baltimore, Maryland, Boston, Quebec, Nantucket, Hatteras, New York, Halifax, Philadelphia and other locations.[2][67] Monthly tables in each edition listed astronomical data and weather predictions for each of the months' dates.[68]\n A Philadelphia edition of Banneker's 1795 almanac contained a lengthy account of a yellow fever epidemic that had struck that city in 1793. Written by a committee whose president was the city's mayor, Matthew Clarkson, the account related the presumed origins and causes of the epidemic, as well as the extent and duration of the event.[69]\n The title pages of two Baltimore editions of Banneker's 1795 almanac had woodcut portraits of him as he may have appeared.[66][70] However, a biographer later concluded that the portraits were more likely portrayals of an idealized African-American youth.[71]\n The almanacs' editors prefaced the publications with adulatory references to Banneker and his race.[36][72] Editions of Banneker's 1792 and 1793 almanacs contained full or abridged copies of a lengthy commendatory letter that James McHenry,[73] the Secretary of the 1787 United States Constitutional Convention and self-described friend of Banneker, had written to Goddard and his partner, James Angell, in August 1791 to support the almanac's publication.[74]\n As first published in Banneker's 1792 almanac and later given an increased circulation when re-published in Philadelphia within The American Museum, or Universal Magazine, McHenry's full letter began: \n Benjamin Banneker, a free Negro, has calculated an Almanack, for the ensuing year, 1792, which being desirous to dispose of, to the best advantage, he has requested me to aid his application to you for that purpose. Having fully satisfied myself, in respect to his title to this type of authorship, if you can agree to him for the price of his work, I may venture to assure you it will do you credit, as Editors, while it will afford you the opportunity to encourage talents that have thus far surmounted the most discouraging circumstances and prejudices.\"[75] \nIn their preface to Banneker's 1792 almanac, the editors of the work wrote that they: feel themselves gratified in the Opportunity of presenting to the Public, through the Medium of their Press, what must be considered as an extraordinary Effort of Genius \u2014 a complete and accurate EPHEMERIS for the Year 1792, calculated by a sable Descendant of Africa, .... \u2014 They flatter themselves that a philanthropic Public, in this enlightened Era, will be induced to give their Patronage and Support to this Work, not only on Account of its intrinsic Merit, (it having met the Approbation of several of the most distinguished Astronomers in America, particularly the celebrated Mr. Rittenhouse) but from similar Motives to those which induced the Editors to give this Calculation the Preference, the ardent desire of drawing modest Merit from Obscurity, and controverting the long-established illiberal Prejudice against the Blacks.[76] After Goddard and Angell had published their 1792 Baltimore edition of the almanac, Angell wrote in the 1793 edition (which he alone edited) that abolitionists William Pitt, Charles James Fox and William Wilberforce had introduced the 1792 edition into the British House of Commons to aid their effort to end the British slave trade in Africa.[77][78] However, the British Parliament's report of the debate that accompanied this effort did not mention either Banneker or his almanac.[79]\n The title page of a Petersburg edition of Banneker's 1794 \"Virginia Almanack\" stated that the work was \"Calculated by that ingenious self taught astronomer Benjamin Banneker, a black man\",[80] repeating a term that Angell had used in the 1793 Baltimore almanac.[77][78] The introduction to a 1795 Philadelphia edition contained a poem titled: \"Addressed to Benjamin Banneker\".[81][82] The verse began and ended:\n Fain would the muse exalt her tuneful lays,And chant in strains sublime Banneker's praise;Fain would the soar on Fame's majestic wing,Thy genius, great Banneker, to sing;Thy talents and thy greatness would I shew,Not in applausive strains to thee undue;..............Long may thou live an evidence to shew,That Afric's sable race have talents too. And may thy genius bright its strength retain;Tho' nature to decline may still remain;And may favour us to thy latest yearsWith thy Ephemeris call'd Banneker's.A work which ages yet unborn shall nameAnd be the monument of lasting fame;A work which after ages shall adore,When Banneker, alas! shall be no more![81] The writer of a tribute in a 1796 Baltimore edition quoted a quatrain[83] and amended another[84] that an Englishman, Thomas Gray, had placed in a popular poem first published in 1751 (see Adaptations and parodies of Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard).[85][86] The revised rhyme stated:\n Nor you ye proud, impute to these the blameIf Afric's sons to genius are unknown,For Banneker has prov'd they may acquire a name,As bright, as lasting, as your own.[85][87] Supported by Andrew, George and Elias Ellicott and heavily promoted by the Maryland and Pennsylvania abolition societies, the early editions of the almanacs achieved commercial success.[88] Printers then distributed at least nine editions of Banneker's 1795 almanac.[89] A Wilmington, Delaware, printer issued five editions for distribution by different vendors. Printers in Baltimore issued three versions of the almanac, while three Philadelphia printers also sold editions.  A Trenton, New Jersey, printer additionally sold a version of the work.[90][91]\n \nIn 1796, Banneker gave a manuscript of one of his almanacs to Suzanna Mason, a member of the Ellicott family who was visiting his home.[92] In 1836, Mason's daughter wrote a published memoir of her mother's life, letters and manuscripts.[93]  The memoir contained a copy of a poem that Mason had sent to Banneker shortly after her 1796 visit.[94] A portion of the verse stated: But thou, a man exhalted high,Conspicuous in the world's keen eye,On record now thy name's enrolled,And future ages will be told,There lived a man called Banneker,An African astronomer.[95] Banneker kept a series of journals that contained his notebooks for astronomical observations, his diary and accounts of his dreams.[31][96] The journals, only one of which escaped a fire on the day of his funeral, additionally contained a number of mathematical calculations and puzzles.[31][96][97]\n The surviving journal described in April 1800 Banneker's recollections of the 1749, 1766 and 1783 emergences of Brood X of the seventeen-year periodical cicada, Magicicada septendecim, and stated, \"... they may be expected again in they year 1800 which is Seventeen Since their third appearance to me.\"[98] The journal also recorded Banneker's observations on the hives and behavior of honey bees.[99]\n \nBanneker's 1792 almanac contained an extract from an anonymous essay entitled \"On Negro Slavery, and the Slave Trade\" that the Columbian Magazine had published in 1790.[100] After quoting a statement that David Rittenhouse had made (that Negroes \"have been doomed to endless slavery by us \u2014 merely because their bodies have been disposed to reflect or absorb the rays of light in a way different from ours\"), the extract concluded: The time, it is hoped is not very remote, when those ill-fated people, dwelling in this land of freedom, shall commence a participation with the white inhabitants, in the blessings of liberty; and experience the kindly protection of government, for the essential rights of human nature.[101] A Philadelphia edition of Banneker's 1793 almanac that Joseph Crukshank published contained copies of pleas for peace that the English anti-slavery poet William Cowper and others had authored,[102] as well as anti-slavery speeches and writings from England and America. The latter included extracts from speeches that William Pitt, Matthew Montagu and Charles James Fox had given to the British House of Commons in 1792 during the debate on a motion for the abolition of the British slave trade,[103] an extract from a 1789 poem by an English Quaker, Thomas Wilkinson,[104] and an extract from a query in Thomas Jefferson's 1787 Notes on the State of Virginia.[105][106]\n Crukshank's edition of Banneker's 1793 almanac also contained a copy of \"A Plan of a Peace-Office, for the United States\".[107] Although the almanac did not identify the Plan's author, writers later attributed the work to Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the 1776 Declaration of Independence.[108]\n The Plan proposed the appointment of a \"Secretary of Peace\", described the Secretary's powers and advocated federal support and promotion of the Christian religion.  The Plan stated:\n I. Let a Secretary of Peace be appointed to preside in this office; ....; let him be a genuine republican and a sincere Christian, ....\n II. Let a power be given to the Secretary to establish and maintain free schools in every city, village and township in the United States; .... Let the youth of our country be instructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and in the doctrines of a religion of some kind; the Christian religion should be preferred to all others; for it belongs to this religion exclusively to teach us not only to cultivate peace with all men, but to forgive\u2014nay more, to love our very enemies. ....\n III. Let every family be furnished at public expense, by the Secretary of this office, with an American edition of the Bible. ....\n IV. Let the following sentence be inscribed in letters of gold over the door of every home in the United States:  THE SON OF MAN CAME INTO THE WORLD, NOT TO DESTROY MEN'S LIVES, BUT TO SAVE THEM.\n V. To inspire a veneration for human life, and a horror at the shedding of human blood, let all those laws be repealed which authorise juries, judges, sheriffs, or hangmen to assume the resentments of individuals, and to commit murder in cold blood in any case whatever. ....\n \nVI. To subdue that passion for war, .... militia laws should everywhere be repealed, and military dresses and military titles should be laid aside. ....[109] On August 19, 1791, after departing the federal capital area, Banneker wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson, who in 1776 had drafted the United States Declaration of Independence and in 1791 was serving as the United States Secretary of State (see: List of Secretaries of State of the United States).[110][111] Quoting language in the Declaration, the letter expressed a plea for justice for African Americans.\n To further support this plea, Banneker included within his letter a handwritten manuscript of an almanac for 1792 containing his ephemeris with his astronomical calculations. He retained handwritten copies of the letter and Jefferson's August 30, 1791, reply in a volume of manuscripts that became part of a journal.[112]\n In late 1792, James Angell published a Baltimore edition of Banneker's 1793 almanac that contained copies of Banneker's letter and Jefferson's reply.[113] Soon afterwards, a Philadelphia printer distributed two sequential editions of a widely circulated pamphlet that also contained the letter and reply.[114]\n The Universal Asylum, and Columbian Magazine also published Banneker's letter and Jefferson's reply in Philadelphia in late 1792.[115] The Magazine's editors (A Society of Gentlemen) titled the letter as being \"from the famous self-taught astronomer, Benjamin Banneker, a black man\".[115]\n In his letter, Banneker accused Jefferson of criminally using fraud and violence to oppress his slaves by stating:\n \n.... Sir, how pitiable is it to reflect, that altho you were so fully convinced of the benevolence of the Father of mankind, and of his equal and impartial distribution of those rights and privileges which he had conferred upon them, that you should at the same time counteract his mercies, in detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a part of my brethren under groaning captivity and cruel oppression, that you should at the Same time be found guilty of that most criminal act, which you professedly detested in others, with respect to your Selves.[110][116] The letter ended:\n \nAnd now Sir, I Shall conclude and Subscribe my Self with the most profound respect,Your most Obedient humble ServantBenjamin Banneker[110][117] Jefferson's reply did not directly respond to Banneker's accusations, but instead expressed his support for the advancement of his \"black brethren\". His reply, which writers have characterized as \"courteous\", \"polite\", \"ambivalent\", \"ambiguous\", \"evasive\", \"tepid\" and \"noncommittal\",[118] stated:\n Philadelphia Aug. 30. 1791.Sir,I thank you sincerely for your letter of the 19th. instant and for the Almanac it contained. no body wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the other colours of men, & that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence both in Africa & America. I can add with truth that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced for raising the condition both of their body & mind to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecillity of their present existence, and other circumstance which cannot be neglected, will admit. I have taken the liberty of sending your almanac to Monsieur de Condorcet, Secretary of the Academy of sciences at Paris, and member of the Philanthropic society because I considered it as a document to which your whole colour had a right for their justification against the doubts which have been entertained of them. I am with great esteem, Sir,Your most obedt. humble servt.Th: Jefferson[119] Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, to whom Jefferson sent Banneker's almanac, was a noted French mathematician and abolitionist who was a member of the French Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis des Noirs (Society of the Friends of the Blacks).[31][120] It appears that the Academy of Sciences itself did not receive the almanac.[121]\n When writing his letter, Banneker informed Jefferson that his 1791 work with Andrew Ellicott on the District boundary survey had affected his work on his 1792 ephemeris and almanac by stating:\n .... And altho I had almost declined to make my calculation for the ensuing year, in consequence of that time which I had allotted therefor being taking up at the Federal Territory by the request of Mr. Andrew Ellicott,  ....[110][122] On the same day that he replied to Banneker (August 30, 1791), Jefferson sent a letter to the Marquis de Condorcet that contained the following paragraph relating to Banneker's race, abilities, almanac and work with Andrew Ellicott:\n I am happy to be able to inform you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I procured him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference in the structure of the parts on which intellect depends.[123][124] \nIn 1809, three years after Banneker's death, Jefferson expressed a different opinion of Banneker in a letter to Joel Barlow that criticized a \"diatribe\" that a French abolitionist, Henri Gr\u00e9goire, had written in 1808:[125] \nthe whole do not amount in point of evidence, to what we know ourselves of Banneker. we know he had spherical trigonometry enough to make almanacs, but not without the suspicion of aid from Ellicot, who was his neighbor & friend, & never missed an opportunity of puffing him. I have a long letter from Banneker which shews him to have had a mind of very common stature indeed.[126][127] Banneker never married.[128] For reasons that are unclear, the four editions of his 1797 almanac were the last ones that printers published.[129][130]  After selling much of his homesite to the Ellicotts and others,[14][131] he probably died in his log cabin nine years later on October 19, 1806, aged 74.[132] (Some sources state that Banneker died on Sunday, October 9, 1806, which was actually a Thursday.)[2][133] His chronic alcoholism, which worsened as he aged, may have contributed to his death.[134]\n An obituary concluded: \n Mr. Banneker is a prominent instance to prove that a descendant of Africa is susceptible of as great mental improvement and deep knowledge into the mysteries of nature as that of any other nation.[135] A commemorative obelisk that the Maryland Bicentennial Commission and the State Commission on Afro American History and Culture erected in 1977 near his unmarked grave stands in the yard of the Mount Gilboa African Methodist Episcopal Church in Oella, Maryland (see Mount Gilboa Chapel).[136]\n On the day of his funeral in 1806, a fire burned Banneker's log cabin to the ground, destroying many of his belongings and papers.[2][137][138] In 1813, William Goodard, who had published the Baltimore edition of Banneker's 1792 almanac (Banneker's first published almanac), donated the manuscript for the almanac to the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts.[139]\n The Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston holds in its collections the August 17, 1791, handwritten letter that Banneker sent to Thomas Jefferson.[140] Jefferson endorsed the letter as received on August 21, 1791.[141]\n The Library of Congress holds a copy of Jefferson's August 30, 1791, handwritten reply to Banneker.[142] Jefferson produced this document on a letter copying press made by James Watt & Co. that he used before he sent his reply to Banneker.[143] He retained the copy in his files.[144]\n The Library of Congress also holds a copy of Jefferson's August 30, 1791, handwritten letter to the Marquis de Condorcet that described Banneker's race, abilities, almanac and work with Andrew Ellicott.[123] Jefferson produced this document on his copying press before sending the handwritten letter to the Marquis.[145]\n The Library of Congress holds a handwritten duplicate of Jefferson's letter to the Marquis de Condorcet. The pagination in the duplicate differs from that in the copy that Jefferson produced on his copying press. The Library attributes the duplicate to Jefferson.[146]\n The Princeton University Library holds within its Straus Autograph Collection the recipient's copy of the handwritten letter that Jefferson sent to Joel Barlow in 1809. Jefferson's letter cited the letter that Banneker had sent to him in 1791. Barlow endorsed Jefferson's letter after he received it.[147]\n The Library of Congress holds a copy of Jefferson's 1809 letter to Joel Barlow that Jefferson had retained in his files after sending his handwritten letter to Barlow.[126] Jefferson used a polygraph device that enabled him to make the copy at the same time that he was writing the original. An Englishman, John Isaac Hawkins, and an American, Charles Willson Peale, had earlier developed this device with the help of Jefferson's suggestions.[147][148]\n In 1987, a member of the Ellicott family, which had retained Banneker's only remaining journal, donated that document and other Banneker manuscripts to the Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore.[149] The family also retained several items that Banneker had used after borrowing them from George Ellicott, as well as some that Banneker himself had owned.[137][150]\n In 1996, a descendant of George Ellicott decided to sell at auction some of those items, including a drop-leaf table, candlesticks, candle molds, maps, letters and diaries.[151] Although supporters of the planned Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Oella, Maryland, had hoped to obtain these and several other items related to Banneker and the Ellicotts, a Virginia investment banker won most of the items with a series of bids that totaled $85,000. The purchaser stated that he expected to keep some of the items and to donate the rest to the planned African American Civil War Memorial museum in Washington, D.C.[152]\n In 1997, it was announced that the artifacts would initially be exhibited in the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and then loaned to the Banneker-Douglass Museum in Annapolis, Maryland. After completion of the Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Oella, the artifacts would be loaned to that facility for a period of twenty years.[153] The Oella museum displayed the table, candle molds and candlesticks after it opened in 1998.[154]\n A substantial mythology exaggerating Banneker's accomplishments has developed during the two centuries that have elapsed since his death, becoming a part of African-American culture (see Mythology of Benjamin Banneker).[155][156] Several such urban legends describe Banneker's alleged activities in the Washington, D.C., area around the time that he assisted Andrew Ellicott in the federal district boundary survey.[43][156][157] Others involve his clock, his astronomical works, his almanacs and his journals.[156][158]\n A United States postage stamp and the names of a number of recreational and cultural facilities, schools, streets, and other facilities and institutions throughout the United States have commemorated Banneker's documented and mythical accomplishments throughout the years since he lived (see Commemorations of Benjamin Banneker). In 1983, Rita Dove, a future Poet Laureate of the United States, wrote a biographical poem about Banneker while on the faculty of Arizona State University.[159]\n ", "tags": ["Benjamin Banneker", "1731 births", "1806 deaths", "African-American writers", "18th-century American male writers", "People from Baltimore County, Maryland", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 maint: location", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "CS1 Latin-language sources (la)", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages", "Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from November 2019", "Articles with hCards", "CS1: long volume value", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Articles with LibriVox links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nFree African-American scientist, surveyor, almanac author and farmer\n\n\nBenjamin BannekerLibrary of CongressBenjamin Banneker depicted on a 1943 mural by Maxime Seelbinder in the Recorder of Deeds Building in Washington, D.C.

Born in Baltimore County, Maryland, to a free African-American woman and a former slave, Banneker had little or no formal education and was largely self-taught. He became known for assisting Major Andrew Ellicott in a survey that established the original borders of the District of Columbia, the federal capital district of the United States.\nBanneker's knowledge of astronomy helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with Thomas Jefferson on the topics of slavery and racial equality, Jefferson having earlier drafted the United States Declaration of Independence. Abolitionists and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining artifacts are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes commemorate him and his works. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate his accomplishments or attribute to him the achievements of others.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Notable works\n\n2.1 Survey of the original boundaries of the District of Columbia\n2.2 Banneker's almanacs\n2.3 Banneker's journals\n\n\n3 Political views\n4 Correspondence with Thomas Jefferson\n5 Death\n6 Banneker artifacts\n7 Mythology and commemorations\n8 Electronic copies of Banneker's publications\n9 See also\n10 Notes\n11 References\n12 Further reading\n13 External links\n\n\nEarly life\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland, to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a freed slave from Guinea who died in 1759.[2][3] There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.\nBanneker himself and his earliest biographers described him as having only African ancestry.[4][5][6] None of Banneker's surviving papers describe a white ancestor or identify the name of his grandmother.[5]\nHowever, later biographers have contended that Banneker's mother was the child of Molly Welsh, a former white indentured servant, and an African slave named Banneka.[3][5][7] The first published description of Molly Welsh was based on interviews with her descendants that took place in 1836, long after the deaths of both Molly and Benjamin.[5][8] According to that story, Molly purchased Banneka to help establish a farm located near the future site of Ellicott's Mills, Maryland, west of Baltimore.[9]\nA biographer suggested in 2002 that Banneka may have been a member of the Dogon people, who several anthropologists have claimed had an early knowledge of astronomy (see Dogon astronomical beliefs).[10] Molly supposedly freed and married Banneka, who may have shared his knowledge of astronomy with her.[11] The biographer suggested that Benjamin acquired this knowledge from Molly, as Benjamin was born after Banneka's death.[10]\nA genealogist who in 2016 reported an analysis of records related to Banneker's family tree was unable to identify any documents that showed that Banneker had a white grandmother, but could not rule out that possibility. The report noted that the name \"Bannaker\" may have had the same origin as that of Banaka, a small village in the present-day Klay District of Bomi County in northwestern Liberia that had once participated in the African slave trade.[3][12]\n\n View of the Patapsco Valley from Ellicott City (June 2012)\nIn 1737, Banneker was named at the age of 6 on the deed of his family's 100-acre (0.40\u00a0km2) farm in the Patapsco Valley in rural Baltimore County.[13][14][15] A letter writer stated in 1791 that Banneker's parents had sent him to an obscure school where he learned reading, writing and arithmetic as far as double position.[16] However, the remainder of Banneker's early life is not well documented.\nUnverified accounts that first appeared in books published more than 140 years after Banneker's death relate that, as a young teenager, Banneker met and befriended Peter Heinrich, a Quaker who later established a school near the Banneker family farm.[17][18] (Quakers were leaders in the anti-slavery movement and advocates of racial equality (see Quakers in the abolition movement and Testimony of equality)).[19] These accounts state that Heinrich shared his personal library and provided Banneker with his only classroom instruction.[18][20] Banneker's formal education (if any) presumably ended when he was old enough to help on his family's farm.[21]\n\nNotable works\nAround 1753, at about the age of 21, Banneker reportedly completed a wooden clock that struck on the hour. He appears to have modeled his clock from a borrowed pocket watch by carving each piece to scale. The clock purportedly continued to work until his death.[21][22]\nAfter his father died in 1759, Banneker lived with his mother and sisters.[2][23] In 1768, he signed a Baltimore County petition to move the county seat from Joppa to Baltimore.[24] An entry for his property in a 1773 Baltimore County tax list identified Banneker as the only adult member of his household.[25]\n\n Total solar eclipse (1999)\nIn 1772, brothers Andrew Ellicott, John Ellicott and Joseph Ellicott moved from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and bought land along the Patapsco Falls near Banneker's farm on which to construct gristmills, around which the village of Ellicott's Mills (now Ellicott City) subsequently developed.[26][27] The Ellicotts were Quakers who held the same views on racial equality as did many of their faith.[26][28] Banneker studied the mills and became acquainted with their proprietors.[29][30]\nIn 1788, George Ellicott, a son of Andrew Ellicott, loaned Banneker books and equipment to begin a more formal study of astronomy.[31][32][33] During the following year, Banneker sent George his work calculating a solar eclipse.[31][32][34]\nIn 1790, Banneker prepared an ephemeris for 1791, which he hoped would be placed within a published almanac.[35] However, he was unable to find a printer that was willing to publish and distribute the work.[31][36]\n\nSurvey of the original boundaries of the District of Columbia\n Library of Congress1835 map of the District of Columbia showing Washington City in its center, Georgetown to the west of the city, and the town of Alexandria in the District's south corner.\n 1799 portrait of Andrew Ellicott\nIn early 1791, U.S. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson asked surveyor Major Andrew Ellicott (a son of Joseph Ellicott and a cousin of George Ellicott) to survey an area that would contain a new federal district. In February 1791, Ellicott left a surveying team that had he had been leading in western New York so that he could begin the district's survey. Ellicott then hired Banneker as a replacement to assist in the initial survey of the federal district's boundaries, advancing him $60 for travel expenses to and at Georgetown.[37][38]\nThe territory that became the original District of Columbia was formed from land along the Potomac River that the states of Maryland and Virginia ceded to the federal government of the United States in accordance with the 1790 federal Residence Act and later legislation.  The territory was a square that measured 10 miles (16\u00a0km) on each side, totaling 100 square miles (260\u00a0km2) (see: Founding of Washington, D.C.).[37][38][39] Ellicott's team placed boundary marker stones at or near every mile point along the borders of the new capital territory (see: Boundary markers of the original District of Columbia).[37][38]\nBiographers have stated that Banneker's duties on the survey consisted primarily of making astronomical observations and calculations to establish base points, including one at Jones Point in Alexandria, Virginia, where the survey started and where the south corner stone was to be located.[37][40] They have also stated that Banneker maintained a clock that he used to relate points on the ground to the positions of stars at specific times.[31][41]\n\n Northeast No. 4 boundary marker stone of the original District of Columbia in Washington, D.C. and Prince George's County, Maryland (2005)\nHowever, some have noted that Banneker's actual role in the survey is uncertain, as his involvement in the effort \"rests on extremely meager documentation\".[42][43] An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south corner stone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".[44] The news report did not mention Banneker's name.[45]\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because the time that he was devoting to the project was conflicting with the time that he had expected to use to calculate an ephemeris for the year of 1792.[46][47] Further, the arrival of spring required him to direct more attention to his farm than was needed during the winter.[47] In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, Benjamin and Joseph Ellicott, who usually assisted Andrew, had completed the New York survey and were able to join the survey of the federal district at around that time.[47]\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.[31][47] The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.  The team laid the Maryland stones and completed the boundary survey in 1792.[37][38][48]\n\nBanneker's almanacs\nAfter returning to Ellicott's Mills, Banneker made astronomical calculations that predicted eclipses and planetary conjunctions for inclusion in an almanac and ephemeris for the year of 1792.[2][36][49] To aid Banneker in his efforts to have his almanac published, Andrew Ellicott (who had been authoring almanacs and ephemerides of his own since 1780)[50] forwarded Banneker's ephemeris to James Pemberton, the president of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage.[31][36][51]\n\n National Portrait Gallery1796 oil portrait of David Rittenhouse by Charles Willson Peale\nPemberton then asked William Waring, a Philadelphia mathematician and ephemeris calculator,[52] and David Rittenhouse, a prominent American astronomer, almanac author,[53] surveyor and scientific instrument maker who was at the time serving as the president of the American Philosophical Society,[54] to confirm the accuracy of Banneker's work.[36][55] Waring endorsed Banneker's work, stating, \"I have examined Benjamin Banneker's Almanac for 1792, and am of the Opinion that it well deserves the Acceptance and Encouragement of the Public.\"[56]\nRittenhouse responded to Pemberton by stating that Banneker's ephemeris \"was a very extraordinary performance, considering the Colour of the Author\" and that he \"had no doubt that the Calculations are sufficiently accurate for the purposes of a common Almanac. .... Every instance of Genius amongst the Negroes is worthy of attention, because their suppressors seem to lay great stress on their supposed inferior mental abilities.\"[57] Banneker reportedly replied to Rittenhouse's endorsement by stating: \"I am annoyed to find that the subject of my race is so much stressed. The work is either correct or it is not. In this case, I believe it to be perfect.\"[58]\n\n Rhode Island Historical Society, ProvidencePortrait of William Goddard (ca. 1780\u20131785)\nPemberton then made arrangements for Joseph Crukshank (a Philadelphia Quaker who was a founder of the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery and who had since 1770 been publishing almanacs, including at least one that Waring had calculated) to print Banneker's almanac.[31][59] Having thus secured the support of Pemberton, Rittenhouse and Waring, Banneker delivered a manuscript containing his ephemeris to William Goddard, a Baltimore printer who had published The Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia Almanack and Ephemeris for every year since 1782.[60] Goddard then agreed to print and distribute Banneker's work within an almanac and ephemeris for the year of 1792.[61]\nBanneker's Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia Almanack and Ephemeris, for the Year of our Lord, 1792 was the first in a six-year series of almanacs and ephemerides that printers agreed to publish and sell.[31][36] At least 28 editions of the almanacs, some of which appeared during the same year, were printed in seven cities in five states: Baltimore; Philadelphia; Wilmington, Delaware; Alexandria, Virginia; Petersburg, Virginia; Richmond, Virginia; and Trenton, New Jersey.[31][62][63]\n\n Title page of the Baltimore edition of Banneker's 1792 almanac and ephemeris.\nThe title pages of the Baltimore editions of Banneker's 1792, 1793 and 1794 almanacs and ephemerides stated that the publications contained:\n\n\nthe Motions of the Sun and Moon, the True Places and Aspects of the Planets, the Rising and Setting of the Sun, Place and Age of the Moon, &c. \u2013 The Lunations, Conjunctions, Eclipses, Judgment of the Weather, Festivals, and other remarkable Days; Days for holding the Supreme and Circuit Courts of the United States, as also the useful Courts in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia.

That edition and others contained tables listing the times of high tides or the methods for calculating high water at Cape Charles and Point Lookout, Virginia, Annapolis and Baltimore, Maryland, Boston, Quebec, Nantucket, Hatteras, New York, Halifax, Philadelphia and other locations.[2][67] Monthly tables in each edition listed astronomical data and weather predictions for each of the months' dates.[68]\nA Philadelphia edition of Banneker's 1795 almanac contained a lengthy account of a yellow fever epidemic that had struck that city in 1793. Written by a committee whose president was the city's mayor, Matthew Clarkson, the account related the presumed origins and causes of the epidemic, as well as the extent and duration of the event.[69]\nThe title pages of two Baltimore editions of Banneker's 1795 almanac had woodcut portraits of him as he may have appeared.[66][70] However, a biographer later concluded that the portraits were more likely portrayals of an idealized African-American youth.[71]\n\n Independence National Historical Park, PhiladelphiaPortrait of James McHenry (ca. 1795\u20131800)\nThe almanacs' editors prefaced the publications with adulatory references to Banneker and his race.[36][72] Editions of Banneker's 1792 and 1793 almanacs contained full or abridged copies of a lengthy commendatory letter that James McHenry,[73] the Secretary of the 1787 United States Constitutional Convention and self-described friend of Banneker, had written to Goddard and his partner, James Angell, in August 1791 to support the almanac's publication.[74]\nAs first published in Banneker's 1792 almanac and later given an increased circulation when re-published in Philadelphia within The American Museum, or Universal Magazine, McHenry's full letter began: \n\nBenjamin Banneker, a free Negro, has calculated an Almanack, for the ensuing year, 1792, which being desirous to dispose of, to the best advantage, he has requested me to aid his application to you for that purpose. Having fully satisfied myself, in respect to his title to this type of authorship, if you can agree to him for the price of his work, I may venture to assure you it will do you credit, as Editors, while it will afford you the opportunity to encourage talents that have thus far surmounted the most discouraging circumstances and prejudices.\"[75]\nIn their preface to Banneker's 1792 almanac, the editors of the work wrote that they:feel themselves gratified in the Opportunity of presenting to the Public, through the Medium of their Press, what must be considered as an extraordinary Effort of Genius \u2014 a complete and accurate EPHEMERIS for the Year 1792, calculated by a sable Descendant of Africa, .... \u2014 They flatter themselves that a philanthropic Public, in this enlightened Era, will be induced to give their Patronage and Support to this Work, not only on Account of its intrinsic Merit, (it having met the Approbation of several of the most distinguished Astronomers in America, particularly the celebrated Mr. Rittenhouse) but from similar Motives to those which induced the Editors to give this Calculation the Preference, the ardent desire of drawing modest Merit from Obscurity, and controverting the long-established illiberal Prejudice against the Blacks.[76]\nAfter Goddard and Angell had published their 1792 Baltimore edition of the almanac, Angell wrote in the 1793 edition (which he alone edited) that abolitionists William Pitt, Charles James Fox and William Wilberforce had introduced the 1792 edition into the British House of Commons to aid their effort to end the British slave trade in Africa.[77][78] However, the British Parliament's report of the debate that accompanied this effort did not mention either Banneker or his almanac.[79]\nThe title page of a Petersburg edition of Banneker's 1794 \"Virginia Almanack\" stated that the work was \"Calculated by that ingenious self taught astronomer Benjamin Banneker, a black man\",[80] repeating a term that Angell had used in the 1793 Baltimore almanac.[77][78] The introduction to a 1795 Philadelphia edition contained a poem titled: \"Addressed to Benjamin Banneker\".[81][82] The verse began and ended:\n\nFain would the muse exalt her tuneful lays,And chant in strains sublime Banneker's praise;Fain would the soar on Fame's majestic wing,Thy genius, great Banneker, to sing;Thy talents and thy greatness would I shew,Not in applausive strains to thee undue;..............Long may thou live an evidence to shew,That Afric's sable race have talents too. And may thy genius bright its strength retain;Tho' nature to decline may still remain;And may favour us to thy latest yearsWith thy Ephemeris call'd Banneker's.A work which ages yet unborn shall nameAnd be the monument of lasting fame;A work which after ages shall adore,When Banneker, alas! shall be no more![81]\nThe writer of a tribute in a 1796 Baltimore edition quoted a quatrain[83] and amended another[84] that an Englishman, Thomas Gray, had placed in a popular poem first published in 1751 (see Adaptations and parodies of Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard).[85][86] The revised rhyme stated:\n\nNor you ye proud, impute to these the blameIf Afric's sons to genius are unknown,For Banneker has prov'd they may acquire a name,As bright, as lasting, as your own.[85][87]\nSupported by Andrew, George and Elias Ellicott and heavily promoted by the Maryland and Pennsylvania abolition societies, the early editions of the almanacs achieved commercial success.[88] Printers then distributed at least nine editions of Banneker's 1795 almanac.[89] A Wilmington, Delaware, printer issued five editions for distribution by different vendors. Printers in Baltimore issued three versions of the almanac, while three Philadelphia printers also sold editions.  A Trenton, New Jersey, printer additionally sold a version of the work.[90][91]\n\nIn 1796, Banneker gave a manuscript of one of his almanacs to Suzanna Mason, a member of the Ellicott family who was visiting his home.[92] In 1836, Mason's daughter wrote a published memoir of her mother's life, letters and manuscripts.[93]  The memoir contained a copy of a poem that Mason had sent to Banneker shortly after her 1796 visit.[94] A portion of the verse stated:But thou, a man exhalted high,Conspicuous in the world's keen eye,On record now thy name's enrolled,And future ages will be told,There lived a man called Banneker,An African astronomer.[95]\nBanneker's journals\n Brood X periodical cicada\nBanneker kept a series of journals that contained his notebooks for astronomical observations, his diary and accounts of his dreams.[31][96] The journals, only one of which escaped a fire on the day of his funeral, additionally contained a number of mathematical calculations and puzzles.[31][96][97]\nThe surviving journal described in April 1800 Banneker's recollections of the 1749, 1766 and 1783 emergences of Brood X of the seventeen-year periodical cicada, Magicicada septendecim, and stated, \"... they may be expected again in they year 1800 which is Seventeen Since their third appearance to me.\"[98] The journal also recorded Banneker's observations on the hives and behavior of honey bees.[99]\n\nPolitical views\nBanneker's 1792 almanac contained an extract from an anonymous essay entitled \"On Negro Slavery, and the Slave Trade\" that the Columbian Magazine had published in 1790.[100] After quoting a statement that David Rittenhouse had made (that Negroes \"have been doomed to endless slavery by us \u2014 merely because their bodies have been disposed to reflect or absorb the rays of light in a way different from ours\"), the extract concluded:The time, it is hoped is not very remote, when those ill-fated people, dwelling in this land of freedom, shall commence a participation with the white inhabitants, in the blessings of liberty; and experience the kindly protection of government, for the essential rights of human nature.[101]\nA Philadelphia edition of Banneker's 1793 almanac that Joseph Crukshank published contained copies of pleas for peace that the English anti-slavery poet William Cowper and others had authored,[102] as well as anti-slavery speeches and writings from England and America. The latter included extracts from speeches that William Pitt, Matthew Montagu and Charles James Fox had given to the British House of Commons in 1792 during the debate on a motion for the abolition of the British slave trade,[103] an extract from a 1789 poem by an English Quaker, Thomas Wilkinson,[104] and an extract from a query in Thomas Jefferson's 1787 Notes on the State of Virginia.[105][106]\n\n Winterthur Museum,Winterthur, Delaware1783 oil portrait of Dr. Benjamin Rush by Charles Willson Peale\nCrukshank's edition of Banneker's 1793 almanac also contained a copy of \"A Plan of a Peace-Office, for the United States\".[107] Although the almanac did not identify the Plan's author, writers later attributed the work to Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the 1776 Declaration of Independence.[108]\nThe Plan proposed the appointment of a \"Secretary of Peace\", described the Secretary's powers and advocated federal support and promotion of the Christian religion.  The Plan stated:\n\nI. Let a Secretary of Peace be appointed to preside in this office; ....; let him be a genuine republican and a sincere Christian, ....\nII. Let a power be given to the Secretary to establish and maintain free schools in every city, village and township in the United States; .... Let the youth of our country be instructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and in the doctrines of a religion of some kind; the Christian religion should be preferred to all others; for it belongs to this religion exclusively to teach us not only to cultivate peace with all men, but to forgive\u2014nay more, to love our very enemies. ....\nIII. Let every family be furnished at public expense, by the Secretary of this office, with an American edition of the Bible. ....\nIV. Let the following sentence be inscribed in letters of gold over the door of every home in the United States:  THE SON OF MAN CAME INTO THE WORLD, NOT TO DESTROY MEN'S LIVES, BUT TO SAVE THEM.\nV. To inspire a veneration for human life, and a horror at the shedding of human blood, let all those laws be repealed which authorise juries, judges, sheriffs, or hangmen to assume the resentments of individuals, and to commit murder in cold blood in any case whatever. ....\n\nVI. To subdue that passion for war, .... militia laws should everywhere be repealed, and military dresses and military titles should be laid aside. ....[109]\nCorrespondence with Thomas Jefferson\n Independence National Historical Park, Philadelphia1791 oil portrait of Thomas Jefferson by Charles Willson Peale\nOn August 19, 1791, after departing the federal capital area, Banneker wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson, who in 1776 had drafted the United States Declaration of Independence and in 1791 was serving as the United States Secretary of State (see: List of Secretaries of State of the United States).[110][111] Quoting language in the Declaration, the letter expressed a plea for justice for African Americans.\nTo further support this plea, Banneker included within his letter a handwritten manuscript of an almanac for 1792 containing his ephemeris with his astronomical calculations. He retained handwritten copies of the letter and Jefferson's August 30, 1791, reply in a volume of manuscripts that became part of a journal.[112]\nIn late 1792, James Angell published a Baltimore edition of Banneker's 1793 almanac that contained copies of Banneker's letter and Jefferson's reply.[113] Soon afterwards, a Philadelphia printer distributed two sequential editions of a widely circulated pamphlet that also contained the letter and reply.[114]\nThe Universal Asylum, and Columbian Magazine also published Banneker's letter and Jefferson's reply in Philadelphia in late 1792.[115] The Magazine's editors (A Society of Gentlemen) titled the letter as being \"from the famous self-taught astronomer, Benjamin Banneker, a black man\".[115]\nIn his letter, Banneker accused Jefferson of criminally using fraud and violence to oppress his slaves by stating:\n\n\n.... Sir, how pitiable is it to reflect, that altho you were so fully convinced of the benevolence of the Father of mankind, and of his equal and impartial distribution of those rights and privileges which he had conferred upon them, that you should at the same time counteract his mercies, in detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a part of my brethren under groaning captivity and cruel oppression, that you should at the Same time be found guilty of that most criminal act, which you professedly detested in others, with respect to your Selves.[110][116]\nThe letter ended:\n\n\nAnd now Sir, I Shall conclude and Subscribe my Self with the most profound respect,Your most Obedient humble ServantBenjamin Banneker[110][117]\nJefferson's reply did not directly respond to Banneker's accusations, but instead expressed his support for the advancement of his \"black brethren\". His reply, which writers have characterized as \"courteous\", \"polite\", \"ambivalent\", \"ambiguous\", \"evasive\", \"tepid\" and \"noncommittal\",[118] stated:\n\nPhiladelphia Aug. 30. 1791.Sir,I thank you sincerely for your letter of the 19th. instant and for the Almanac it contained. no body wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the other colours of men, & that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence both in Africa & America. I can add with truth that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced for raising the condition both of their body & mind to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecillity of their present existence, and other circumstance which cannot be neglected, will admit. I have taken the liberty of sending your almanac to Monsieur de Condorcet, Secretary of the Academy of sciences at Paris, and member of the Philanthropic society because I considered it as a document to which your whole colour had a right for their justification against the doubts which have been entertained of them. I am with great esteem, Sir,Your most obedt. humble servt.Th: Jefferson[119]\n Palace of Versailles, FranceOil portrait of the Marquis de Condorcet, circa 1789-1794\nMarie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, to whom Jefferson sent Banneker's almanac, was a noted French mathematician and abolitionist who was a member of the French Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis des Noirs (Society of the Friends of the Blacks).[31][120] It appears that the Academy of Sciences itself did not receive the almanac.[121]\nWhen writing his letter, Banneker informed Jefferson that his 1791 work with Andrew Ellicott on the District boundary survey had affected his work on his 1792 ephemeris and almanac by stating:\n\n.... And altho I had almost declined to make my calculation for the ensuing year, in consequence of that time which I had allotted therefor being taking up at the Federal Territory by the request of Mr. Andrew Ellicott,  ....[110][122]\nOn the same day that he replied to Banneker (August 30, 1791), Jefferson sent a letter to the Marquis de Condorcet that contained the following paragraph relating to Banneker's race, abilities, almanac and work with Andrew Ellicott:\n\n Mus\u00e9e Lorrain, Nancy, France1800 oil portrait  of Henri Gr\u00e9goire by Pierre Joseph C\u00e9lestin Fran\u00e7ois\nI am happy to be able to inform you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I procured him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference in the structure of the parts on which intellect depends.[123][124]\nIn 1809, three years after Banneker's death, Jefferson expressed a different opinion of Banneker in a letter to Joel Barlow that criticized a \"diatribe\" that a French abolitionist, Henri Gr\u00e9goire, had written in 1808:[125]\nthe whole do not amount in point of evidence, to what we know ourselves of Banneker. we know he had spherical trigonometry enough to make almanacs, but not without the suspicion of aid from Ellicot, who was his neighbor & friend, & never missed an opportunity of puffing him. I have a long letter from Banneker which shews him to have had a mind of very common stature indeed.[126][127]\nDeath\n Replica of Banneker's log cabin in Benjamin Banneker Historical Park, Oella, Maryland (2017)\nBanneker never married.[128] For reasons that are unclear, the four editions of his 1797 almanac were the last ones that printers published.[129][130]  After selling much of his homesite to the Ellicotts and others,[14][131] he probably died in his log cabin nine years later on October 19, 1806, aged 74.[132] (Some sources state that Banneker died on Sunday, October 9, 1806, which was actually a Thursday.)[2][133] His chronic alcoholism, which worsened as he aged, may have contributed to his death.[134]\nAn obituary concluded: \n\nMr. Banneker is a prominent instance to prove that a descendant of Africa is susceptible of as great mental improvement and deep knowledge into the mysteries of nature as that of any other nation.[135]\nA commemorative obelisk that the Maryland Bicentennial Commission and the State Commission on Afro American History and Culture erected in 1977 near his unmarked grave stands in the yard of the Mount Gilboa African Methodist Episcopal Church in Oella, Maryland (see Mount Gilboa Chapel).[136]\n\nBanneker artifacts\nOn the day of his funeral in 1806, a fire burned Banneker's log cabin to the ground, destroying many of his belongings and papers.[2][137][138] In 1813, William Goodard, who had published the Baltimore edition of Banneker's 1792 almanac (Banneker's first published almanac), donated the manuscript for the almanac to the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts.[139]\nThe Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston holds in its collections the August 17, 1791, handwritten letter that Banneker sent to Thomas Jefferson.[140] Jefferson endorsed the letter as received on August 21, 1791.[141]\nThe Library of Congress holds a copy of Jefferson's August 30, 1791, handwritten reply to Banneker.[142] Jefferson produced this document on a letter copying press made by James Watt & Co. that he used before he sent his reply to Banneker.[143] He retained the copy in his files.[144]\nThe Library of Congress also holds a copy of Jefferson's August 30, 1791, handwritten letter to the Marquis de Condorcet that described Banneker's race, abilities, almanac and work with Andrew Ellicott.[123] Jefferson produced this document on his copying press before sending the handwritten letter to the Marquis.[145]\nThe Library of Congress holds a handwritten duplicate of Jefferson's letter to the Marquis de Condorcet. The pagination in the duplicate differs from that in the copy that Jefferson produced on his copying press. The Library attributes the duplicate to Jefferson.[146]\nThe Princeton University Library holds within its Straus Autograph Collection the recipient's copy of the handwritten letter that Jefferson sent to Joel Barlow in 1809. Jefferson's letter cited the letter that Banneker had sent to him in 1791. Barlow endorsed Jefferson's letter after he received it.[147]\nThe Library of Congress holds a copy of Jefferson's 1809 letter to Joel Barlow that Jefferson had retained in his files after sending his handwritten letter to Barlow.[126] Jefferson used a polygraph device that enabled him to make the copy at the same time that he was writing the original. An Englishman, John Isaac Hawkins, and an American, Charles Willson Peale, had earlier developed this device with the help of Jefferson's suggestions.[147][148]\n\n Interior of Benjamin Banneker Museum in Oella, Maryland. A drop-leaf table that Banneker used is in the background. (2017)\nIn 1987, a member of the Ellicott family, which had retained Banneker's only remaining journal, donated that document and other Banneker manuscripts to the Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore.[149] The family also retained several items that Banneker had used after borrowing them from George Ellicott, as well as some that Banneker himself had owned.[137][150]\nIn 1996, a descendant of George Ellicott decided to sell at auction some of those items, including a drop-leaf table, candlesticks, candle molds, maps, letters and diaries.[151] Although supporters of the planned Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Oella, Maryland, had hoped to obtain these and several other items related to Banneker and the Ellicotts, a Virginia investment banker won most of the items with a series of bids that totaled $85,000. The purchaser stated that he expected to keep some of the items and to donate the rest to the planned African American Civil War Memorial museum in Washington, D.C.[152]\nIn 1997, it was announced that the artifacts would initially be exhibited in the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and then loaned to the Banneker-Douglass Museum in Annapolis, Maryland. After completion of the Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Oella, the artifacts would be loaned to that facility for a period of twenty years.[153] The Oella museum displayed the table, candle molds and candlesticks after it opened in 1998.[154]\n\nMythology and commemorations\nFurther information: Mythology of Benjamin Banneker and Commemorations of Benjamin Banneker\n Statue of Benjamin Banneker in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. (2020)\nA substantial mythology exaggerating Banneker's accomplishments has developed during the two centuries that have elapsed since his death, becoming a part of African-American culture (see Mythology of Benjamin Banneker).[155][156] Several such urban legends describe Banneker's alleged activities in the Washington, D.C., area around the time that he assisted Andrew Ellicott in the federal district boundary survey.[43][156][157] Others involve his clock, his astronomical works, his almanacs and his journals.[156][158]\nA United States postage stamp and the names of a number of recreational and cultural facilities, schools, streets, and other facilities and institutions throughout the United States have commemorated Banneker's documented and mythical accomplishments throughout the years since he lived (see Commemorations of Benjamin Banneker). In 1983, Rita Dove, a future Poet Laureate of the United States, wrote a biographical poem about Banneker while on the faculty of Arizona State University.[159]\n\nElectronic copies of Banneker's publications\nBanneker, Benjamin (1791). \"Benjamin Banneker's Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia Almanack and EPHEMERIS, for the YEAR of our LORD, 1792; Being BISSEXTILE, or LEAP-YEAR, and the Sixteenth Year of AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE, which commenced July 4, 1776\" (48 digitized images).

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"\n\n^ (1) Banneker, 1791, p. 2.(2) McHenry, p. 185.\n\n^ Banneker, 1791, p. 2.\n\n^ a b (1) Bedini 1999, p. 190.\n\n^ a b (2) Banneker, Benjamin (1792).

Wefald writes that when Jefferson received a letter and almanac from Benjamin Banneker, Jefferson was \"honest enough to change his position.\" Jefferson did not say that he had changed his opinion of the intellectual abilities of blacks. In his letter to Banneker, Aug. 30, 1791, Jefferson merely said: \"No body wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the other colors of men, and that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence, both in Africa & America.\" Closely read, Jefferson's letter is only an indication that he \"wishes to see such proofs\", but there is no definite indication that he changed his mind. On Banneker's abilities Jefferson was ambivalent.(2) Johnson. \"Banneker sent a manuscript copy of his work to Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson along with a plea against the continuance of black slavery and received a courteous, if evasive, reply.\"(3) Asim, Jabari (October 12, 2018). \"Getting It Twisted\".

Jefferson first acquired the letter-copying device he called \"the finest invention of the present age\" in March of 1804. Invented and named by Englishman John Isaac Hawkins, the polygraph used the principles of the pantograph, a draftsman's tool for reducing and enlarging drawings. The writer's hand moves one pen whose action is duplicated by the second one, producing a copy strikingly like the original.Before he returned to England in 1803, Hawkins assigned his American patent rights to Charles Willson Peale, who developed and marketed the invention. Jefferson was one of his most eager clients, purchasing one for the President's House and one for Monticello. He soon exchanged these machines for new ones, as Peale continued to perfect the design \u2014 often according to Jefferson's suggestions.

The astronomical journal is the only remaining artifact written in Banneker's hand, as his cabin and most of his belongings burned down in a fire as his body was being laid in the ground in 1806. On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member Moses Sheppard (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh. In 1999 MdHS sent the journal to the Center for Conservation in Philadelphia where it was rebound, deacidified, and given full conservation treatment.(2) \"Banneker Astronomical Journal, 1781; 1790-1802; 1806\".

A selection of rare items used by Benjamin Banneker, noted black American scientist, is to be auctioned early next month, but organizers of the planned Banneker museum and park in Baltimore County hope to raise money to buy the artifacts first.The items -- which include a William and Mary drop-leaf table, candlesticks and molds, and several documents -- are scheduled to be put on the block at Sloane's Auction House in Bethesda.Jean Walsh, a member of the Friends of Benjamin Banneker Historical Park, said the items had been in the possession of a descendant of George Ellicott, who at age 17 befriended the much older Banneker -- known as \"the first black man of science.\"\"George was interested in astronomy, and he loaned a number of things to Banneker, including the table and several books,\" Walsh said....  Groundbreaking is planned for September for the long-awaited Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Oella, and Walsh and other supporters would like to exhibit the items there.Gwen Marable, president of the organization, said an attempt had been made to persuade the owner, Elizabeth Wilde of Indianapolis, to donate or sell some of the artifacts to the museum.\"We want to spearhead an effort to keep these things here in Maryland,\" said Marable, a descendant of one of Banneker's three sisters.Samuel Hopkins -- a descendant of the Ellicott family, who were mill owners and co-founders of Ellicott City -- said he encouraged Wilde to turn the artifacts over to the museum.\"I spoke to her some time ago and told her I thought it would be fine if she gave some of the stuff to the museum,\" Hopkins said. \"I suggested to her that, if she did not give it to the society, that she might let the society make copies of the documents for display.\"Patrick O'Neill, who is helping to arrange the auction for Sloane's, said the items are being appraised. Appraisal of historic pieces can be difficult, though officials expect the table to sell for $10,000 to $30,000. .... According to Silvio A. Bedini, author of The Life of Benjamin Banneker, the scientist instructed his nephews to return the table and books to the Ellicott family and give them some of his effects. The day of his funeral in 1806, Banneker's log cabin burned to the ground. It is on that site where the museum and park are to be built.Bedini said the artifacts are especially valuable because they are among the few remaining privately owned Banneker items..(2) Saulny, Susan (August 16, 1996). \"Banneker Kin Decry Auctioning Of His Artifacts\".

Items auctioned in Bethesda in September came from a descendant of the Ellicotts, a white family that forged a strong friendship with the scientist, who died in 1806. Among them: a maple and pine drop-leaf table believed to have been lent to Banneker by the Ellicott family, two candlesticks and a candle mold, a ledger from the Ellicott & Co. general store noting purchases by Banneker, and several documents and letters pertaining to Banneker and the Ellicotts. ..... Friedman, a history buff, donated the artifacts to a Civil War monument and visitors center being built by his friend Frank Smith Jr., a Washington councilman.

Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten-mile square but the design of the city as well. None of these accounts has described the contribution which Banneker actually made.\"(2) Bedini, 1972, p. 126. \"Benjamin Banneker's name does not appear on any of the contemporary documents or records relating to the selection, planning, and survey of the City of Washington.

Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792.
