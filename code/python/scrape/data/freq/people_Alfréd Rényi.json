{"name": "Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi", "content": "Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi (20 March 1921 \u2013 1 February 1970) was a Hungarian mathematician who made contributions in combinatorics, graph theory, number theory but mostly in probability theory.[2][3]\n R\u00e9nyi was born in Budapest to Art\u00far R\u00e9nyi and Borb\u00e1la Alexander; his father was a mechanical engineer, while his mother was the daughter of philosopher and literary critic Bernhard Alexander; his uncle was Franz Alexander, a Hungarian-American psychoanalyst and physician.\nHe was prevented from enrolling in university in 1939 due to the anti-Jewish laws then in force, but enrolled at the University of Budapest in 1940 and finished his studies in 1944. At this point, he was drafted to forced labour service, from which he escaped. He then completed his Ph.D. in 1947 at the University of Szeged, under the advisement of Frigyes Riesz. He married Katalin Schulhof (who used Kat\u00f3 R\u00e9nyi as her married name), herself a mathematician, in 1946; their daughter Zsuzsanna was born in 1948. After a brief assistant professorship at Budapest, he was appointed Professor Extraordinary at the University of Debrecen in 1949. In 1950, he founded the Mathematics Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, now bearing his name, and directed it until his early death. He also headed the Department of Probability and Mathematical Statistics of the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, from 1952. He was elected a corresponding member (1949), then full member (1956), of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\n R\u00e9nyi proved, using the large sieve, that there is a number \n\n\n\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K}\n\n such that every even number is the sum of a prime number and a number that can be written as the product of at most \n\n\n\nK\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K}\n\n primes. Chen's theorem, a strengthening of this result, shows that the theorem is true for K\u00a0=\u00a02, for all sufficiently large even numbers. The case K\u00a0=\u00a01 is the still-unproven Goldbach conjecture.\n In information theory, he introduced the spectrum of R\u00e9nyi entropies of order \u03b1, giving an important generalisation of the Shannon entropy and the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence.  The R\u00e9nyi entropies give a spectrum of useful diversity indices, and lead to a spectrum of fractal dimensions. The R\u00e9nyi\u2013Ulam game is a guessing game where some of the answers may be wrong.\n In probability theory, he is also known for his parking constants, which characterize the solution to the following problem: given a street of some length and cars of unit length parking on a random free position on the street, what is the mean density of cars when there are no more free positions? The solution to that problem is asymptomatically equal to 0.7475979 (sequence A050996 in the OEIS).[4] Thus, random parking is 25.2% less efficient than optimal packing.\n He wrote 32 joint papers with Paul Erd\u0151s,[5] the most well-known of which are his papers introducing the Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model of random graphs.[6]\n R\u00e9nyi, who was addicted to coffee, is the source of the quote:[7][8] \"A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems\", which is generally ascribed to Erd\u0151s. It has been suggested that this sentence was originally formulated in German, where it can be interpreted as a wordplay on the double meaning of the word Satz (theorem or coffee residue), but it is more likely that the original formulation was in Hungarian.[9]\n He is also famous for having said, \"If I feel unhappy, I do mathematics to become happy. If I am happy, I do mathematics to keep happy.\"[10]\n The Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Prize, awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Science, was established in his honor.[11]\n Foundations of Probability and Probability Theory have both been reprinted by Dover Publications.\n ", "tags": ["1921 births", "1970 deaths", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "Number theorists", "Graph theorists", "Probability theorists", "Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "Mathematicians from Budapest", "University of Debrecen faculty", "Hungarian World War II forced labourers", "Hungarian escapees", "Escapees from Nazi concentration camps", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian mathematician\nThe native form of this personal name is R\u00e9nyi Alfr\u00e9d.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nAlfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyiBorn(1921-03-20)20 March 1921Budapest, HungaryDied1 February 1970(1970-02-01) (aged\u00a048)Budapest, HungaryNationalityHungarianAlma\u00a0materUniversity of SzegedScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsE\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd UniversityDoctoral advisorFrigyes Riesz[1]Doctoral studentsImre Csisz\u00e1rGyula O.
