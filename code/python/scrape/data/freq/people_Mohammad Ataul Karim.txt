{"name": "Mohammad Ataul Karim", "content": "\n Mohammad Ataul Karim (born 4 May 1953) is a Bangladeshi American scientist and higher education administrator, with expertise in electro-optical systems, optical computing, and pattern recognition. Karim is ranked amongst the top 50 researchers who contributed most to Applied Optics in its 50-year history.[1][2] Karim served as provost and executive vice chancellor[3][4][5] of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth between 2013-2020, and was for 9 years the first Vice President for Research[6] of Old Dominion University (ODU) in Norfolk, Virginia.\n Born on 4 May 1953 in Barlekha, a border town in South Sylhet. He attended Shatma Primary for his elementary education and Patharia Chotolekha High for a year after which he left home to be schooled at Faujdarhat Cadet College (1965\u20131969), Sylhet MC College (1969\u20131972), and the University of Dacca (1972\u20131976) wherefrom he received his bachelor's honors degree in physics. Karim started his graduate studies at the University of Alabama in 1976 wherefrom he earned his master's degrees in physics (1978) and electrical engineering (1979), and a doctor of philosophy in electrical engineering (1982).[7]\n Karim began creative writing in high school. A large number of his popular science writings in Bengali appeared in Bigyan Shamoeeki and Bangla Academy Bigyan Patrika during 1972\u20131976. Of these, the most significant were Biborthon Kahinee, a series of articles on cosmic and biological evolution, and Shamproteek, a monthly feature of current affairs in science, both of which appeared in Bigyan Shamoeeki. By sophomore year in 1974, he had completed his first book manuscript which he submitted to Bangla Academy for publication. After about two years, the Academy informed him that it was not prepared to take a chance on its juvenile author. This episode troubled him deeply ending his creative writing efforts in Bengali. All his subsequent books and articles were written in English and all were published from outside of Bangladesh.[citation needed]\n A 2004 Government of Bangladesh report[8] and a number of books in Bengali, including Bangladesher Shera Bigyani (Hitler A. Halim, Shikor, 2004) and Medhabi Manusher Golpo (Mohammad Kaykobad, Annyaprokash, 2005), as well as Star Insight, cite him as an example of outstanding success of the Bangladeshi diaspora.[9] His efforts to correct illegal practices that otherwise discriminated against international graduate students was featured by the Chronicle of Higher Education,[10] The Wall Street Journal in \"Hidden Costs of a Brain Gain\"[11] and in turn by David Heenan in his book \"Flight Capital: The Alarming Exodus of America's Best And Brightest\". Karim is married and has three children.\n He has had academic appointments with the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (1982\u20131983), Wichita State University (1983\u20131986), University of Dayton (1986-1998: Founding Director, Electro-Optics Program, 1990\u20131998; Chair of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 1994-1998), University of Tennessee at Knoxville (1998\u20132000: Head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering), the City University of New York (2000\u20132004: Dean of Engineering), and Old Dominion University (2004-2013: Vice President for Research).\n During his academic career, he supervised MS/PhD research of over 60 graduate students[7] and authored 19 books, 8 book chapters, and over 365 research papers.[7] He guest edited 33 journal special issues in areas of communication, computing, multimedia, networks, optics, pattern recognition, remote sensing, and software.\n He leads the International Conference on Computer and Information Technology, now in its 16th year.[12][13] Since 2009, with assistance of 5 teams of guest editors, Karim produced 20 journal special issues that featured works of  Bangladesh-based researchers in the fields of communications,[14] computing,[15] multimedia,[16] networks,[17] and software.[18] His edited book on \"Technical Challenges and Design Issues in Bengali Language Processing\"\n[19] provides a state-of-the-art platform for information communication technology research and development that is of significance to nearly 260 million Bengali-speaking people who live in Bangladesh, India and in diaspora in Middle East, Europe, and US. This milestone work includes 16 chapters coauthored by 41 researchers from Bangladesh, Canada, India, Ireland, Norway, UK, and US.\n ", "tags": ["1953 births", "Old Dominion University faculty", "Bangladeshi physicists", "Bangladeshi scientists", "Bangladeshi emigrants to the United States", "American inventors", "Bengali scientists", "Bengali physicists", "Bengali Muslims", "Bengali educators", "University of Dhaka alumni", "University of Alabama alumni", "University of Arkansas at Little Rock faculty", "Wichita State University faculty", "University of Tennessee faculty", "University of Dayton faculty", "City University of New York faculty", "Living people", "Fellows of the Institute of Physics", "Murari Chand College alumni", "People from Barlekha Upazila", "Faujdarhat Cadet College alumni", "Articles with a promotional tone from December 2011", "All articles with a promotional tone", "Wikipedia articles with style issues from December 2011", "All articles with style issues", "Articles with peacock terms from December 2011", "All articles with peacock terms", "Articles with multiple maintenance issues", "Use British English from July 2015", "Use dmy dates from July 2015", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from August 2019", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article has multiple issues.
