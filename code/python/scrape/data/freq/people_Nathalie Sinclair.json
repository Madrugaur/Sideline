{"name": "Nathalie Sinclair", "content": "Nathalie Michelle Sinclair (born 1970)[1] is a Canadian researcher in mathematics education who holds the Canada Research Chair in Tangible Mathematics Learning at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.[2]\n Sinclair was born in Grenoble, the daughter of Canadian academics who were on sabbatical there; she grew up in Calgary. She began her undergraduate studies at McGill University in business, but quickly switched to mathematics, and then earned a master's degree with Len Berggren at Simon Fraser on the history of mathematics and mathematics in medieval Islam.[3]\n She became a middle school teacher of mathematics and French on Bowen Island,[3] Sinclair then earned her Ph.D. in 2002 from Queen's University at Kingston, under the joint supervision of Peter Taylor of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and William Higginson of the Faculty of Education.[4]\n In 2003, Sinclair accepted a joint appointment in the College of Natural Sciences and the College of Education at Michigan State University.[5]\n In 2014, Sinclair and Nicholas Jackiw developed a mathematical app targeted at children ages three to eight. The purpose of the app is to teach children math through \"hands-on\" learning.[6] Two years later, she was named a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in Tangible Mathematics Learning.[7]\n In March 2017, Sinclair was named Canada's Mathematics Ambassador by Partners in Research for her contributions to the field of mathematics.[8] Later that year, Sinclair was elected a Member of the College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists of the Royal Society of Canada.[9] In 2019, Sinclair was awarded the Svend Pedersen Lecture Award.[10]\n ", "tags": ["1970 births", "Living people", "Mathematics educators", "McGill University Faculty of Science alumni", "Simon Fraser University alumni", "Queen's University at Kingston alumni", "Simon Fraser University faculty", "Canada Research Chairs", "Canadian women mathematicians", "21st-century mathematicians", "21st-century Canadian mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Canadian mathematician\nNathalie SinclairSinclair in 2011Academic backgroundEducationMcGill University  PhD, Queen's UniversityAcademic workInstitutionsMichigan State University  Simon Fraser University\n\nNathalie Michelle Sinclair (born 1970)[1] is a Canadian researcher in mathematics education who holds the Canada Research Chair in Tangible Mathematics Learning at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Selected publications\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nSinclair was born in Grenoble, the daughter of Canadian academics who were on sabbatical there; she grew up in Calgary.
