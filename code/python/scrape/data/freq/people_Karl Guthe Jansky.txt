He is considered one of the founding figures of radio astronomy.[1]\n Karl Guthe Jansky was born in what was then the Territory of Oklahoma where his father, Cyril M. Jansky, was Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Oklahoma at Norman. Cyril M. Jansky, born in Wisconsin of Czech immigrants, had started teaching at the age of sixteen. He was a teacher throughout his active life, retiring as Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin.  He was an engineer with a strong interest in physics, a trait passed on to his sons.  Karl Jansky was named after Dr. Karl Eugen Guthe, a Professor of Physics at the University of Michigan who had been an important mentor to Cyril M. Jansky.\n Karl Jansky's mother, born Nellie Moreau, was of French and English descent.  Karl's brother Cyril Jansky Jr., who was ten years older, helped build some of the earliest radio transmitters in the country, including 9XM in Wisconsin (now WHA of Wisconsin Public Radio) and 9XI in Minnesota (now KUOM).[2]\n Karl Jansky attended college at the University of Wisconsin where he received his BS in physics in 1927. In 1928 he joined the Bell Telephone Laboratories site in Holmdel, New Jersey. Bell Labs wanted to investigate atmospheric and ionospheric properties using \"short waves\" (wavelengths of about 10\u201320 meters) for use in trans-Atlantic radio telephone service. As a radio engineer, Jansky was assigned the job of investigating sources of static that might interfere with radio voice transmissions.\n At Bell Telephone Laboratories Jansky built an antenna designed to receive radio waves at a frequency of 20.5 MHz (wavelength about 14.6 meters). It was mounted on a turntable that allowed it to be rotated in any direction, earning it the name \"Jansky's merry-go-round\". It had a diameter of approximately 100\u00a0ft. (30 meter) and stood 20\u00a0ft. (6 meter) tall. By rotating the antenna on a set of four Ford Model-T tires, the direction of a received signal could be pinpointed.  A small shed to the side of the antenna housed an analog pen-and-paper recording system.\n After recording signals from all directions for several months, Jansky eventually categorized them into three types of static: nearby thunderstorms, distant thunderstorms, and a faint steady hiss of unknown origin. He spent over a year investigating the source of the third type of static. The location of maximum intensity rose and fell once a day, leading Jansky to initially surmise that he was detecting radiation from the Sun.\n After a few months of following the signal, however, the brightest point moved away from the position of the Sun. Jansky also determined that the signal repeated on a cycle of 23 hours and 56 minutes, the period of the Earth's rotation relative to the stars (sidereal day), instead of  relative to the sun (solar day). By comparing his observations with optical astronomical maps, Jansky concluded that the radiation was coming from the Milky Way and was strongest in the direction of the center of the galaxy, in the constellation of Sagittarius.\n His discovery was widely publicized, appearing in the New York Times of May 5, 1933.[3] In 1933, he published a paper entitled \"Electrical disturbances apparently of extraterrestrial origin\". Jansky wanted to further investigate the Milky Way radio waves after 1935 (he called the radiation \"star noise\"), but he found little support from either astronomers, for whom it was completely foreign, or Bell Labs, which could not justify the cost of research on a phenomenon that did not significantly affect trans-Atlantic communications systems.\n Several scientists were interested in Jansky's discovery, but radio astronomy remained a dormant field for several years, due in part to Jansky's lack of formal training as an astronomer. His discovery had come in the midst of the Great Depression, and observatories were wary of taking on any new and potentially risky projects.[original research?]\n Two men who learned of Jansky's 1933 discovery were of great influence on the later development of the new study of radio astronomy:  one was Grote Reber, a radio engineer who singlehandedly built a radio telescope in his Illinois back yard in 1937 and did the first systematic survey of astronomical radio waves. The second was John D. Kraus, who, after World War II, started a radio observatory at Ohio State University and wrote a textbook on radio astronomy, long considered a standard by radio astronomers.\n In honor of Jansky, the unit used by radio astronomers for the strength (or flux density) of radio sources is the jansky (1 Jy = 10\u221226 W m\u22122 Hz\u22121).  The crater Jansky on the Moon is also named after him. The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) postdoctoral fellowship program is named after Karl Jansky.[4] Additionally, NRAO awards the Jansky Prize annually in Jansky's honor.[5]  On January 10, 2012, the NRAO announced the Very Large Array (VLA), the radio telescope in Magdalena, New Mexico, would be renamed the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in honor of Karl Jansky's contribution to Radio Astronomy.[6]\n A full-scale replica of Jansky's original rotating telescope is located on the grounds of the Green Bank Observatory (38\u00b025\u203253.9\u2033N 79\u00b048\u203258.5\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff38.431639\u00b0N 79.816250\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.431639; -79.816250, formerly an NRAO site) in Green Bank, West Virginia, near a reconstructed version of Grote Reber's 9-meter dish.\n The original site of Jansky's antenna (40\u00b021\u203254.5\u2033N 74\u00b009\u203248.9\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff40.365139\u00b0N 74.163583\u00b0W\ufeff / 40.365139; -74.163583) at what is now the Bell Labs Holmdel Complex at 101 Crawfords Corner Road, Holmdel, New Jersey, was determined by Tony Tyson and Robert Wilson of Lucent Technologies (the successor of Bell Telephone Laboratories) in 1998, and a monument and plaque were placed there to honor the achievement.[7] The monument is a stylized sculpture of the antenna and is oriented as Jansky's antenna was at 7:10\u00a0p.m. on September 16, 1932, at a moment of maximum signal caused by alignment with the center of our galaxy in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.[8]\n Jansky noise is named after Jansky, and refers to high frequency static disturbances of cosmic origin.\n Jansky was a resident of Little Silver, New Jersey, and died at age 44 in a Red Bank, New Jersey, hospital (now called Riverview Medical Center) due to a heart condition.[9]\n Asteroid 1932 Jansky is named after him.[10]\n ", "tags": ["1905 births", "1950 deaths", "Amateur astronomers", "American astronomers", "20th-century American physicists", "American people of Czech descent", "American people of English descent", "American people of French descent", "Czech-American culture in Oklahoma", "People from Little Silver, New Jersey", "People from Norman, Oklahoma", "Scientists at Bell Labs", "Radio astronomers", "American electrical engineers", "Engineers from New Jersey", "20th-century American engineers", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from July 2019", "Articles with hCards", "All articles that may contain original research", "Articles that may contain original research from October 2019", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American astronomer\n\n\nKarl Guthe JanskyBorn(1905-10-22)October 22, 1905Norman, Oklahoma, U.S.DiedFebruary 14, 1950(1950-02-14) (aged\u00a044)Red Bank, New Jersey, U.S.NationalityAmericanKnown\u00a0forRadio astronomyScientific careerFieldsPhysicsRadio astronomy\nKarl Guthe Jansky (October 22, 1905 \u2013 February 14, 1950) was an American physicist and radio engineer who in August 1931 first discovered radio waves emanating from the Milky Way.
