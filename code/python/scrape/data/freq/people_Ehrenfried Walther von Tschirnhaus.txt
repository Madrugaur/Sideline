{"name": 0.0013157894736842105, "content": "Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus (or Tschirnhau\u00df, German: [\u02c8e\u02d0\u0281\u0259n\u02ccf\u0281i\u02d0t \u02c8walt\u0250 f\u0254n \u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u02d0\u0250\u032fnha\u028as]; 10 April 1651 \u2013 11 October 1708) was a German mathematician, physicist, physician, and philosopher. He introduced the Tschirnhaus transformation and is considered by some to have been the inventor of European porcelain,[1][2] an invention long accredited to Johann Friedrich B\u00f6ttger but others claim porcelain had been made by English manufacturers at an even earlier date.[3]\n Von Tschirnhaus was born in Kieslingswalde (now S\u0142awnikowice in western Poland) and died in Dresden, Saxony.\n Von Tschirnhaus attended the Gymnasium at G\u00f6rlitz. Thereafter he studied mathematics, philosophy, and medicine[4] at the University of Leiden. He traveled considerably in France, Italy, and Switzerland, and served in the army of Holland (1672\u20131673). During his travels he met Baruch de Spinoza and Christiaan Huygens in the Netherlands, Isaac Newton in England, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (with whom he maintained a lifelong correspondence) in Paris. He became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences in Paris.\n The Tschirnhaus transformation, by which he removed certain intermediate terms from a given algebraic equation, is well known. It was published in the scientific journal Acta Eruditorum in 1683.\n In 1682, Von Tschirnhaus worked out the theory of catacaustics and showed that they were rectifiable. This was the second case in which the envelope of a moving line was determined. One of the catacaustics of a parabola still is known as Tschirnhausen cubic.\n In 1696, Johann Bernoulli posed the problem of the brachistochrone to the readers of Acta Eruditorum. Tschirnhaus was one of only five mathematicians to submit a solution. Bernoulli published these contributions (including Tschirnhaus') along with his own in the journal in May of the following year.\n Von Tschirnhaus produced various types of lenses and mirrors, some of them are displayed in museums. He erected a large glass works in Saxony, where he constructed burning glasses of unusual perfection and carried on his experiments (1687\u20131688).\n His work Medicina mentis sive artis inveniendi praecepta generali (1687) combines methods of deduction with empiricism and shows him to be philosophically connected to the Enlightenment.\n Tschirnhaus was for many years forgotten as a philosopher and the studies treating the subject often discuss Tschirnhaus' connection to other philosophers and scientists at the time. During his time at the University of Leiden he started correspondence with Spinoza and later also Leibniz. Tschirnhaus was one of the first to get a copy of Spinoza's masterpiece Ethics.\n After he returned home to Saxony, von Tschirnhaus initiated systematic experiments, using mixtures of various silicates and earths at different temperatures to develop porcelain, which at the time was available only as a costly import from China and Japan. As early as 1704, he showed \u201cporcelan\u201d to Leibniz's secretary. He proposed the establishment of a porcelain factory to Augustus II of Poland, Elector of Saxony, but was denied. Also in 1704, von Tschirnhaus became the supervisor of Johann Friedrich B\u00f6ttger, a nineteen-year-old alchemist who claimed to be able to make gold. B\u00f6ttger only reluctantly and under pressure started to participate in Tschirnhaus\u2019 work by 1707. The use of kaolin (from Schneeberg, Saxony) and alabaster advanced the work, so that August II named him the director of the porcelain factory he intended to establish. The Elector ordered payment of 2,561 thalers to von Tschirnhaus, but the recipient requested postponement until the factory was producing. When Von Tschirnhaus died suddenly, on 11 October 1708, the project came to a halt.\n Three days after Von Tschirnhaus's death, there was a burglary at his house and, according to a report by B\u00f6ttger, a small piece of porcelain was stolen. This report suggests that B\u00f6ttger himself recognized that Von Tschirnhaus already knew how to make porcelain, a key piece of evidence that Von Tschirnhaus and not B\u00f6ttger was the inventor. Work resumed on 20 March 1709, by which time Melchior Steinbr\u00fcck had arrived to assess the dead man's estate, which included the notes about making porcelain, and had met with B\u00f6ttger. On 28 March 1709, B\u00f6ttger went to August II and announced the invention of porcelain. B\u00f6ttger now was nominated to head the first European manufactory for porcelain. Steinbr\u00fcck became an inspector and married B\u00f6ttger's sister.\n Contemporary testimonies of knowledgeable people indicate that Tschirnhaus invented porcelain. In 1719, for example, Samuel St\u00f6lzel of the porcelain factory of Meissen went to Vienna with the still-secret recipe and confirmed that it had been invented by Von Tschirnhaus and not by B\u00f6ttger. In that same year, the General Secretary of the Meissen factory also indicated that the invention was not B\u00f6ttger's \u201cbut by the late Herr von Tschirnhaus[,] whose written science\u201d was handed to B\u00f6ttger \u201cby the inspector Steinbr\u00fcck.\u201d Nevertheless, B\u00f6ttger's name became closely associated with the invention.\n ", "tags": ["1651 births", "1708 deaths", "17th-century German mathematicians", "18th-century German mathematicians", "German inventors", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "People from the Electorate of Saxony", "Leiden University alumni", "Meissen porcelain", "17th-century German writers", "People associated with Baruch Spinoza", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the New International Encyclopedia", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Ehrenfried von TschirnhausEhrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus.Born10 April 1651\u00a0(1651-04-10)Kieslingswalde, Margraviate Upper Lusatia, Saxony (present-day Poland)Died11 October 1708\u00a0(1708-10-12) (aged\u00a057)Dresden, Electorate of SaxonyNationalityGermanScientific careerAcademic advisorsArnold GeulincxFranciscus SylviusNotable studentsChristian Wolff\n\n Medicina mentis, 1687\nEhrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus (or Tschirnhau\u00df, German: [\u02c8e\u02d0\u0281\u0259n\u02ccf\u0281i\u02d0t \u02c8walt\u0250 f\u0254n \u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u02d0\u0250\u032fnha\u028as]; 10 April 1651 \u2013 11 October 1708) was a German mathematician, physicist, physician, and philosopher.
