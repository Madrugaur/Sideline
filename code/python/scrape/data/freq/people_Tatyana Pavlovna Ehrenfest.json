{"name": "Tatyana Pavlovna Ehrenfest", "content": "Tatyana Pavlovna Ehrenfest, later van Aardenne-Ehrenfest, (Vienna, October 28, 1905 \u2013 Dordrecht, November 29, 1984) was a Dutch mathematician. She was the daughter of Paul Ehrenfest (1880\u20131933) and Tatyana Alexeyevna Afanasyeva (1876\u20131964).\n Under her married name, Tanja van Aardenne-Ehrenfest, she is known for her contributions to De Bruijn sequences, low-discrepancy sequences, and the BEST theorem.\n Tatyana Ehrenfest was born in Vienna and spent her childhood in St Petersburg. In 1912 the Ehrenfests moved to Leiden where her father succeeded H.A. Lorentz as professor at the University of Leiden. Until 1917 she was home schooled; after that, she attended the Gymnasium in Leiden and passed the final exams in 1922.\nShe studied mathematics and physics at the University of Leiden. In 1928 she went to G\u00f6ttingen where she took courses from Harald Bohr and Max Born. On December 8, 1931, she obtained her Ph.D. in Leiden.[1] After that, she was never employed and, in particular, never held any academic position.[2]\n De Bruijn sequences are cyclic sequences of symbols for a given alphabet and parameter \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n such that every length-\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n subsequence occurs exactly once within them.
