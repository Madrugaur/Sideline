Their work includes many results in knot theory (and broad generalizations of that subject)[3] and aspects of low-dimensional topology.  They gave the first nontrivial examples of topological conjugacy of linear transformations,[4] which led to a flowering of research on the topological study of spaces with singularities.[5]\n More recently, they combined their understanding of singularities, first to lattice point counting in polytopes, then to Euler-Maclaurin type summation formulae,[6] and most recently to counting lattice points in the circle.[7]  This last problem is a classical one, initiated by Gauss, and the paper is still being vetted by experts.[citation needed]\n In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[8] Cappell was elected and served as a vice president of the AMS for the term of February 2010 through January 2013.[9][10]\n ", "tags": ["1946 births", "Living people", "Belgian emigrants to the United States", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Topologists", "Princeton University alumni", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences faculty", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "People from Brussels", "Sloan Research Fellows", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from June 2013", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nSylvain CappellSylvain Cappell (right)Born1946 (age\u00a074\u201375)Brussels, BelgiumNationalityBelgian AmericanAlma\u00a0materPrinceton UniversityColumbia UniversityAwardsAMS Distinguished Public Service Award (2018)Guggenheim Fellowship (1989\u201390)Sloan Fellowship (1971\u201372)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsNew York UniversityDoctoral advisorWilliam BrowderDoctoral studentsShmuel Weinberger\n\nSylvain Edward Cappell (born 1946), is a Belgian American mathematician and former student of William Browder at Princeton University, is a topologist who has spent most of his career at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU, where he is now the Silver Professor of Mathematics.\nHe was born in Brussels, Belgium and immigrated with his parents to New York City in 1950 and grew up largely in this city.[1] In 1963, as a senior at the Bronx High School of Science, he won first place in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search for his work on \"The Theory of Semi-cyclical Groups with Special Reference to Non-Aristotelian Logic.\" He is best known for his \"codimension one splitting theorem\",[2] which is a standard tool in high-dimensional geometric topology, and a number of important results proven with his collaborator Julius Shaneson (now at the University of Pennsylvania).
