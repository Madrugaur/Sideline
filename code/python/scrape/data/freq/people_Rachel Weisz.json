Raised Jewish, she never fully connected to the faith. She claims she was \"really disobedient\" herself, and has never felt she fits in anywhere.[91]\nIn 2018, Weisz played Sarah Churchill in The Favourite,  winning the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and receiving her second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In April 2019, she entered talks to join Scarlett Johansson in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Black Widow.[92] In July of that year, Weisz was announced to play Melina Vostokoff / Iron Maiden in the film, which will be released on 9 July 2021.[93][94]\n\nTheatre[edit]\nOn stage, Weisz's breakthrough role was that of Gilda in Sean Mathias's 1994 revival of No\u00ebl Coward's Design for Living at the Gielgud Theatre,[95][96] for which she received the London Critics' Circle Award for the most promising newcomer.[97][98] Her portrayal was described as \"wonderful\" by a contemporary review.[99] In 1999, she played the role of Catherine in the Donmar Warehouse production of Tennessee Williams' Suddenly Last Summer,[100] What's on Stage called her \"captivating\", stating that she brought \"a degree of credibility to a difficult part\".[101] The same year, Weisz appeared in Neil LaBute's The Shape of Things at the Almeida Theatre, then temporarily located in London's King's Cross, for which she received a Theatre World Award.[102][103] CurtainUp called her \"a sophisticated, independent artist\" with \"great stage presence\".[104] In 2009, she appeared as Blanche DuBois, in Rob Ashford's revival of the play A Streetcar Named Desire.[105] Her performance in the play was praised by the critics, the Daily Telegraph noted that she \"rises to the challenge magnificently\".[106] Weisz and her husband starred on Broadway in a revival of Harold Pinter's Betrayal. It opened 27 October 2013, and closed 5 January 2014.[107][108] Despite mixed reviews, box office receipts of $17.5 million made it the second highest grossing Broadway play of 2013.[109]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn the summer of 2001, Weisz began dating American filmmaker and producer Darren Aronofsky. They met backstage at London's Almeida Theatre, where she was starring in The Shape of Things. Weisz moved to New York with Aronofsky the following year;[102] in 2005, they were engaged. Their son was born in May 2006 in New York City.[110][111] The couple resided in the East Village in Manhattan. In November 2010, Weisz and Aronofsky announced that they had been apart for months, but remained close friends and were committed to bringing up their son together in New York.[112]\nWeisz and actor Daniel Craig had been friends for many years, and worked together on the film Dream House. They began dating in December 2010 and they married on 22 June 2011 in a private New York ceremony, with four guests in attendance, including Weisz's son and Craig's daughter.[113][114] On 1 September 2018, it was reported that they had their first child together, a daughter.[115]\nThroughout her career, she has been featured on the covers of magazines, such as Vogue.[116] She served as a muse to fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez,[117] and was named L'Or\u00e9al's global ambassador in 2010.[118]\nA British citizen by birth, Weisz became a naturalised US citizen in 2011.[5]\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\nKey\n\n\n\n\nDenotes films that have not yet been released\n\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1994\n\nDeath Machine\n\nJunior

In particular her detailed biography at the British Film Institute (Alexander Larman: Weisz, Rachel (1971\u2013)) states 1971 and so does a biographic article in The Guardian and several other British newspapers. The Evening Standard of 6 March 2006 (Nick Curtis: A Taxing Issue for Partygoers; the Oscars Diary) claims that Weisz herself gives 1971 as her year of birth. However, the database entry of the British Film Institute (\"BFI Film & TV Database: WEISZ, Rachel\". British Film Institute. Archived from the original on 8 January 2011.
