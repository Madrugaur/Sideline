There, she married mathematician Alwyn Horadam and raised three children, persuading the university to update their maternity policies so that (unusually for the time) she could keep her position as a lecturer.[1] She completed a doctorate[3] and became a senior lecturer in 1965, retired in 1983, and was named a fellow of the university in 1995.[2]\n Her daughter Kathy Horadam, also became a mathematician.[1]\n Horadam's research concerned generalised integers,\nformed from a sequence of real numbers greater than one (called generalised prime numbers) as the products of finite multisets of generalised primes.[4]\n She was also the author of a textbook published by the University of New England, Principles of mathematics for economists (1982).[5]\n ", "tags": ["1921 births", "2002 deaths", "British mathematicians", "British women mathematicians", "Australian mathematicians", "Australian women mathematicians", "Number theorists", "Alumni of Girton College, Cambridge", "Alumni of the University of London", "University of New England (Australia) faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use Australian English from June 2020", "All Wikipedia articles written in Australian English", "Use dmy dates from June 2020", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers"], "raw": "English-Australian mathematician\n\nEleanor Mollie Horadam (29 June 1921 \u2013\u00a05 May 2002) was an English-Australian mathematician specialising in the number theory of generalised integers.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Mathematics\n3 References\n4 Further reading\n\n\nLife[edit]\nHoradam was born in Dewsbury, Yorkshire.[2] She read mathematics at Girton College, Cambridge.
