{"name": "Winifred Asprey", "content": "\n Winifred \"Tim\" Alice Asprey (April 8, 1917 \u2013 October 19, 2007) was an American mathematician and computer scientist.  She was one of only around 200 women to earn PhDs in mathematics from American universities during the 1940s, a period of women's underrepresentation in mathematics at this level.[1]\nShe was involved in developing the close contact between Vassar College and IBM that led to the establishment of the first computer science lab at Vassar.[1]\n Asprey was born in Sioux City, Iowa; her parents were Gladys Brown Asprey, Vassar class of 1905, and Peter Asprey Jr.[2]  She had two brothers, actinide and fluorine chemist Larned B. Asprey (1919\u20132005), a signer of the Szil\u00e1rd petition, and military historian and writer Robert B. Asprey (1923\u20132009) who dedicated several of his books to his sister Winifred.[3][4]\n Asprey attended Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, where she earned her undergraduate degree in 1938. As a student there, Asprey met Grace Hopper, the \"First Lady of Computing,\" who taught mathematics at the time. After graduating, Asprey taught at several private schools in New York City and Chicago before going on to earn her MS and PhD degrees from the University of Iowa in 1942 and 1945, respectively.[2] Her doctoral advisor was the topologist Edward Wilson Chittenden.[5]\n Asprey returned to Vassar College as a professor. By then, Grace Hopper had moved to Philadelphia to work on UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer) project. Asprey became interested in computing and visited Hopper to learn about the foundations of computer architecture.[2] Asprey believed that computers would be an essential part of a liberal arts education.\n At Vassar, Asprey taught mathematics and computer science for 38 years and was the chair of the mathematics department from 1957 until her retirement in 1982.[6]\nShe created the first Computer Science Department at Vassar, the first course being taught in 1963, and secured funds for the college's first computer, making Vassar the second college in the nation to acquire an IBM System/360 computer in 1967.[7]\nAsprey connected with researchers at IBM and other research centers and lobbied for computer science at Vassar. In 1989, due to her contributions, the computer center she started was renamed the Asprey Advanced Computation Laboratory.[2]\n ", "tags": ["Vassar College alumni", "University of Iowa alumni", "Vassar College faculty", "American women computer scientists", "20th-century American women scientists", "American women mathematicians", "Computer science educators", "1917 births", "2007 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Mathematicians from Iowa", "20th-century women mathematicians", "20th-century American scientists", "American computer scientists", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from June 2013", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American computer scientist and mathematician\n\n\nWinifred AspreyBorn(1917-04-08)April 8, 1917Sioux City, IowaDiedOctober 19, 2007(2007-10-19) (aged\u00a090)Poughkeepsie (town), New YorkAlma\u00a0materVassar CollegeUniversity of IowaScientific careerFieldsMathematics, computer scienceDoctoral advisorEdward Wilson ChittendenInfluencesGrace Hopper\n\nWinifred \"Tim\" Alice Asprey (April 8, 1917 \u2013 October 19, 2007) was an American mathematician and computer scientist.
