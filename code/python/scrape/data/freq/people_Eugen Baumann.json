{"name": "Eugen Baumann", "content": "Eugen Baumann (12 December 1846 \u2013 3 November 1896) was a German chemist. He was one of the first people to create polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and, together with Carl Schotten, he discovered the Schotten-Baumann reaction.\n Baumann was born in Cannstatt, which is now part of Stuttgart. After he attended a gymnasium in Stuttgart, he was educated in the pharmacy of his father. During his time in Stuttgart, he attended the lectures of Hermann von Fehling at the University of Stuttgart.\n To broaden his education, he went to L\u00fcbeck and Gothenburg to work in pharmacies there. Later, he studied pharmacy at the University of T\u00fcbingen. He passed his first exam in 1870 and received his PhD in 1872 for work with Felix Hoppe-Seyler. He followed Hoppe-Seyler to the University of Stra\u00dfburg where did his habilitation in 1876. The same year, Emil Heinrich Du Bois-Reymond offered him a position as the Head of the Chemistry Department of the Institute of Physiology in Berlin. In 1882, Baumann became professor of medicine at that institute, and subsequently obtained professor position at the University of Freiburg.\n In 1895, he took over the management of Hoppe-Seyler's Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physiologische Chemie with Albrecht Kossel.\n From 1883 till his death, Baumann was married to Theresa Kopp, the daughter of chemist Hermann Kopp, and they had five children. He died at the age of 49 due to a heart problem.[1]\n The organosulfur compounds of the urine were his starting point into the physiological chemistry.[2]  He identified the source for aromatic compounds in urine being the aromatic amino acids, such as tyrosine. He influenced the organosulfur chemistry by the synthesis of thioacetals and thioketals. These substances were subsequently used by other scientists, for example for anesthesia. Together with his coworkers, he was able to prove that thyroxine was the active ingredient in the thyroid gland.[1]\n During his work at the physiological institute, Baumann, together with Carl Schotten, discovered a method to synthesize amides from amines and acid chlorides; this method is still known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction.[3]\n ", "tags": ["1846 births", "1896 deaths", "German chemists", "German inventors", "University of T\u00fcbingen alumni", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Eugen BaumannBorn(1846-12-12)12 December 1846Cannstatt, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, GermanyDied3 November 1896(1896-11-03) (aged\u00a049)Freiburg, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, GermanyNationalityGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of T\u00fcbingenKnown\u00a0forSchotten-Baumann reactionScientific careerFieldsorganic chemistry, physiological chemistryInstitutionsUniversity of T\u00fcbingen, University of Stra\u00dfburg University of Berlin University of FreiburgDoctoral advisorHermann von Fehling, Felix Hoppe-Seyler\n\nEugen Baumann (12 December 1846 \u2013 3 November 1896) was a German chemist.
