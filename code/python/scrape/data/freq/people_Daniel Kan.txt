{"name": "Daniel Kan", "content": "Daniel Marinus Kan (or simply Dan Kan) (August 4, 1927 \u2013 August 4, 2013) was a Dutch mathematician working in homotopy theory.

The general theme of his career had been abstract homotopy theory.[1]\n He received his Ph.D. at Hebrew University in 1955, under the direction of Samuel Eilenberg.  His students include Aldridge K.
