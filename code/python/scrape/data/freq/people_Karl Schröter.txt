{"name": "Karl Schr\u00f6ter", "content": "Karl Walter Schr\u00f6ter (7 September 1905 in Biebrich near Wiesbaden \u2013 22 August 1977 in Berlin) was a German mathematician and logician.[1] Later on, after the war, he made important contributions concerning semantic consequences (German: semantische Folgerungsrelationen) and provability logic (German: syntaktische Ableitbarkeitsrelationen).[1] He worked as a mathematical theoretician and cryptanalyst for the civilian Pers Z S, the cipher bureau of the Foreign Office (German: Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt), from Spring 1941 to the end of World War II.\n From 1928 to 1936, Schr\u00f6ter studied mathematics, physics, philosophy, and psychology at the Universities of G\u00f6ttingen, Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main. Due to family reasons he had to interrupt his studies several times. He then worked in the mathematical logic group at the University of M\u00fcnster lead by Heinrich Scholz. From April 1, 1939, he was a research assistant at the Department of Philosophy at the University of M\u00fcnster. On 20 December 1941, he took his examination for promotion of Dr. phil under the logician Heinrich Scholz studying mathematics, logic, and calculus with a thesis titled Ein allgemeiner Kalk\u00fclbegriff (English: A General Concept of Calculus). On April 1, 1941, he took a leave of absence to join Pers Z S, the Foreign Office civilian cipher bureau, working as a mathematician. However, even during this time he continued to work on problems of basic mathematical research.[1]\n On 19 March 1943 he presented the application to the Faculty of Philosophy and Natural Sciences, with the publication Axiomatisierung der Fregeschen Aussagenkalk\u00fcle (English: Axiomatisation of Frege's Propositional Calculus), to be admitted to his Habilitation. On the basis of the positive opinions of Heinrich Scholz and Adolf Kratzer, the degree of Doctor rerum naturalium habilitatus was awarded to him by certificate of May 22, 1943. On June 9, 1943, the report on the completed Habilitation was given to the Reich Minister. On July 1, 2 and 3, 1943, he held a public trial lecture on the topic Der Nutzen der mathematischen Logik f\u00fcr die Mathematik (English: The Benefits of Mathematical Logic for Mathematics) as a prerequisite for a civil service position as a lecturer. On August 18, 1943, he was appointed lecturer with the authorisation to teach \"Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Research\", all the while still being employed in Berlin as a \"scientific assistant worker\" at Pers Z S.[1]\n Karl Schr\u00f6ter remained at the University of M\u00fcnster from 31 December 1943 until his contract was up on 31 April 1945, when he was taken prisoner by the Counterintelligence Corps (CIC). From early May to the September 30, 1945, he appeared before a joint Anglo-American Commission, first in London, then in Marburg, concerning his work at Pers Z S during the war. After completion, he was dismissed in Marburg after the CIC had determined his political attitude. In the winter semester of 1945/46 he was affiliated as a lecturer in M\u00fcnster.[1]\n From May 1946 until his appointment to Berlin, Schr\u00f6ter was working at M\u00fcnster as a substitute for the Review Committee of the Denazification Main Committee at the Westf\u00e4lische Landesuniversit\u00e4t. In 1948, Karl Schr\u00f6ter was appointed Professor Extraordinarius for mathematical logic at Humboldt University in Berlin.[1]\n In 1967, he became director of the Institute for pure mathematics of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin.[1]\n He was elected corresponding member in 1962 and two years later ordinary member of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin.\n In 1955, Schr\u00f6ter together with G\u00fcnter Asser founded the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Mathematische Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik (English: Journal of mathematical logic and foundations of mathematics) which since 1991 is known as Mathematical Logic Quarterly.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1905 births", "1977 deaths", "German logicians", "Mathematical logicians", "20th-century German mathematicians", "German cryptographers", "Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing German-language text", "Articles containing explicitly cited English-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Karl Schr\u00f6terPicture of Karl Schr\u00f6ter studying.BornSeptember 7, 1905\u00a0(1905-09-07)Biebrich near WiesbadenDiedAugust 22, 1977(1977-08-22) (aged\u00a071)BerlinCitizenshipGermanAlma\u00a0materG\u00f6ttingen Heidelberg  Frankfurt am MainUniversity of M\u00fcnsterKnown\u00a0forsemantic consequencesprovability logicScientific careerFieldsMathematicsLogicInstitutionsUniversity of M\u00fcnsterDoctoral advisorHeinrich ScholzDoctoral studentsDieter Klaua\u00a0[de]\n\nKarl Walter Schr\u00f6ter (7 September 1905 in Biebrich near Wiesbaden \u2013 22 August 1977 in Berlin) was a German mathematician and logician.[1] Later on, after the war, he made important contributions concerning semantic consequences (German: semantische Folgerungsrelationen) and provability logic (German: syntaktische Ableitbarkeitsrelationen).[1] He worked as a mathematical theoretician and cryptanalyst for the civilian Pers Z S, the cipher bureau of the Foreign Office (German: Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt), from Spring 1941 to the end of World War II.\n\nContents\n\n1 Personal life\n2 Publications\n3 External links\n4 References\n\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nFrom 1928 to 1936, Schr\u00f6ter studied mathematics, physics, philosophy, and psychology at the Universities of G\u00f6ttingen, Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.
