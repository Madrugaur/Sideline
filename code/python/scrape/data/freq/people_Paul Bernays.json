{"name": "Paul Bernays", "content": "Paul Isaac Bernays (17 October 1888 \u2013 18 September 1977) was a Swiss mathematician, who made significant contributions to mathematical logic, axiomatic set theory, and the philosophy of mathematics. He was an assistant and close collaborator of David Hilbert.\n Bernays was born into a distinguished German-Jewish family of scholars and businessmen. His great-grandfather, Isaac ben Jacob Bernays, served as chief rabbi of Hamburg from 1821 to 1849.[1]\n Bernays spent his childhood in Berlin, and attended the K\u00f6llner Gymnasium, 1895\u20131907. At the University of Berlin, he studied mathematics under Issai Schur, Edmund Landau, Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, and Friedrich Schottky; philosophy under Alois Riehl, Carl Stumpf and Ernst Cassirer; and physics under Max Planck. At the University of G\u00f6ttingen, he studied mathematics under David Hilbert, Edmund Landau, Hermann Weyl, and Felix Klein; physics under Voigt and Max Born; and philosophy under Leonard Nelson.\n In 1912, the University of Berlin awarded him a Ph.D. in mathematics, for a thesis, supervised by Landau, on the analytic number theory of binary quadratic forms. That same year, the University of Zurich awarded him the Habilitation for a thesis on complex analysis and Picard's theorem. The examiner was Ernst Zermelo. Bernays was Privatdozent at the University of Zurich, 1912\u201317, where he came to know George P\u00f3lya. His collected communications with Kurt G\u00f6del span many decades.\n Starting in 1917, David Hilbert employed Bernays to assist him with his investigations of the foundations of arithmetic. Bernays also lectured on other areas of mathematics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In 1918, that university awarded him a second Habilitation, for a thesis on the axiomatics of the propositional calculus of Principia Mathematica.[2]\n In 1922, G\u00f6ttingen appointed Bernays extraordinary professor without tenure. His most successful student there was Gerhard Gentzen. After the passing of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service in 1933, he was dismissed from this post because of his Jewish ancestry. After working privately for Hilbert for six months, Bernays and his family moved to Switzerland, whose nationality he had inherited from his father, and where the ETH employed him on occasion. He also visited the University of Pennsylvania and was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1935\u201336 and again in 1959\u201360.[3]\n Bernays's collaboration with Hilbert culminated in the two volume work Grundlagen der Mathematik by  Hilbert and Bernays\u00a0(1934, 1939), discussed in Sieg and Ravaglia (2005). In seven papers, published between 1937 and 1954 in the Journal of Symbolic Logic, republished in (M\u00fcller 1976), Bernays set out an axiomatic set theory whose starting point was a related theory John von Neumann had set out in the 1920s. Von Neumann's theory took the notions of function and argument as primitive; Bernays recast von Neumann's theory so that classes and sets were primitive. Bernays's theory, with some modifications by Kurt G\u00f6del, is now known as von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory.\nA proof from the Grundlagen der Mathematik that a sufficiently strong consistent theory cannot contain its own reference functor is now known as the Hilbert\u2013Bernays paradox.\n ", "tags": ["1888 births", "1977 deaths", "20th-century Swiss philosophers", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Jewish philosophers", "Jewish scientists", "Mathematical logicians", "Philosophers of mathematics", "Set theorists", "Swiss Jews", "Swiss mathematicians", "Swiss philosophers", "ETH Zurich faculty", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from January 2018", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Swiss mathematician\nPaul BernaysBorn(1888-10-17)17 October 1888London, United KingdomDied18 September 1977(1977-09-18) (aged\u00a088)Zurich, SwitzerlandNationalitySwissAlma\u00a0materUniversity of BerlinKnown\u00a0forMathematical logic Axiomatic set theoryPhilosophy of mathematicsScientific careerFieldsMathematicsThesis\n\u00dcber die Darstellung von positiven, ganzen Zahlen durch die primitiven, bin\u00e4ren quadratischen Formen einer nicht-quadratischen Diskriminante\u00a0(1912)\n\nDoctoral advisorEdmund LandauDoctoral studentsCorrado B\u00f6hmJulius Richard B\u00fcchiHaskell CurryErwin EngelerGerhard GentzenSaunders Mac LaneInfluencesIssai Schur, Edmund Landau\n\nPaul Isaac Bernays (17 October 1888 \u2013 18 September 1977) was a Swiss mathematician, who made significant contributions to mathematical logic, axiomatic set theory, and the philosophy of mathematics.
