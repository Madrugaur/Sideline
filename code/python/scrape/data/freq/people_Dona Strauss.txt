Her father was a physicist at the University of Cape Town. She grew up in the Eastern Cape, and earned a master's degree in mathematics at the University of Cape Town.[4]\nShe completed her Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge in 1958. Her dissertation, Lattices of Functions, Measures, and Open Sets, was supervised by Frank Smithies.[5]\n After completing her doctorate, she took a faculty position at the University of London. Following her husband's dream of living on a farm in Vermont, she moved to Dartmouth College in 1966.[4] By 1972, she was working at the University of Hull[5] and circa 2008 she became a professor at the University of Leeds.[6][7] After retiring, she has been listed by Leeds as an honorary visiting fellow.[8]\n In South Africa, Strauss developed a strong antipathy to racial discrimination from a combination of being a Jew at the time of the Holocaust and her own observations of South African society. At the University of Cape Town, she became a member of the Non-European Unity Movement. After completing her degree, she left the country in protest over apartheid; her parents also left South Africa, after her father's retirement, for Israel.[4] In the 1950s, she regularly published editorial works in Socialist Review,[9] and in the 1960s she was active in Solidarity (UK).[10]\n As an assistant professor at Dartmouth College in 1969,[11] Strauss took part in a student anti-war protest that occupied Parkhurst Hall, the building that housed the college administration.
