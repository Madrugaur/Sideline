{"name": "Parameshvara Nambudiri", "content": "\n Vatasseri Parameshvara Nambudiri (c. 1380\u20131460)[1]  was a major Indian mathematician and astronomer of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama. He was also an astrologer. Parameshvara was a proponent of observational astronomy in medieval India and he himself had made a series of eclipse observations to verify the accuracy of the computational methods then in use. Based on his eclipse observations, Parameshvara proposed several corrections to the astronomical parameters which had been in use since the times of Aryabhata. The computational scheme based on the revised set of parameters has come to be known as the Drgganita or Drig system. Parameshvara was also a prolific writer on matters relating to astronomy. At least 25 manuscripts have been identified as being authored by Parameshvara.[1]\n Parameshvara was a Hindu of Bhrgugotra following the Ashvalayanasutra of the Rgveda. Parameshvara's family name (Illam) was Vatasseri and his family resided in the village of Alathiyur (Sanskritised as Asvatthagrama) in Tirur, Kerala. Alathiyur is situated on the northern bank of the river Nila (river Bharathappuzha) at its mouth in Kerala. He was a grandson of a disciple of Govinda Bhattathiri (1237\u20131295 CE), a legendary figure in the astrological traditions of Kerala.\n Parameshvara studied under teachers Rudra and Narayana, and also under Sangamagrama Madhava (c. 1350 \u2013 c. 1425) the founder of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics.

Parameshvara was also a teacher of Nilakantha Somayaji (1444\u20131544) the author of the celebrated Tantrasamgraha.\n Parameshvara wrote commentaries on many mathematical and astronomical works such as those by Bhaskara I and Aryabhata. He made a series of  eclipse observations over a 55-year period. Constantly attempted to compare these with the theoretically computed positions of the planets.
