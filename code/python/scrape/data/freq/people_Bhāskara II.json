{"name": "Bh\u0101skara II", "content": "\n Bh\u0101skara (c. 1114\u20131185) also known as Bh\u0101skar\u0101c\u0101rya (\"Bh\u0101skara, the teacher\"), and as Bh\u0101skara II to avoid confusion with Bh\u0101skara I, was an Indian mathematician and astronomer. He was born in Bijapur in Karnataka.[1]\n Born in a Deshastha Brahmin family of scholars, mathematicians and astronomers, Bhaskara was the leader of a cosmic observatory at Ujjain, the main mathematical centre of ancient India.[2] Bh\u0101skara and his works represent a significant contribution to mathematical and astronomical knowledge in the 12th century. He has been called the greatest mathematician of medieval India.[3] His main work Siddh\u0101nta-\u015airomani, (Sanskrit for \"Crown of Treatises\")[4] is divided into four parts called L\u012bl\u0101vat\u012b, B\u012bjaga\u1e47ita, Grahaga\u1e47ita and Gol\u0101dhy\u0101ya,[5] which are also sometimes considered four independent works.[6] These four sections deal with arithmetic, algebra, mathematics of the planets, and spheres respectively. He also wrote another treatise named Kara\u1e47\u0101 Kaut\u016bhala.[6]\n Bh\u0101skara's work on calculus predates Newton and Leibniz by over half a millennium.[7][8] He is particularly known in the discovery of the principles of differential calculus and its application to astronomical problems and computations. While Newton and Leibniz have been credited with differential and integral calculus, there is strong evidence to suggest that Bh\u0101skara was a pioneer in some of the principles of differential calculus. He was perhaps the first to conceive the differential coefficient and differential calculus.[9]\n Bh\u0101skara gives his date of birth, and date of composition of his major work, in a verse in the \u0100ry\u0101 metre:[6]\n rasa-gu\u1e47a-por\u1e47a-mah\u012bsama\n\u015bhaka-n\u1e5bpa samaye 'bhavat mamotpatti\u1e25 /\nrasa-gu\u1e47a-var\u1e63e\u1e47a may\u0101\nsiddh\u0101nta-\u015biroma\u1e47\u012b racita\u1e25 //\n This reveals that he was born in 1036 of the Shaka era (1114 CE), and that he composed the Siddh\u0101nta-\u015airoma\u1e47\u012b when he was 36 years old.[6] He also wrote another work called the Kara\u1e47a-kut\u016bhala when he was 69 (in 1183).[6] His works show the influence of Brahmagupta, \u015ar\u012bdhara, Mah\u0101v\u012bra, Padman\u0101bha and other predecessors.[6]\n He was born in a De\u015bastha Rigvedi Brahmin family[10] near Vijjadavida (believed to be Bijjaragi of Vijayapur in modern Karnataka). Bh\u0101skara is said to have been the head of an astronomical observatory at Ujjain, the leading mathematical centre of medieval India. He lived in the Sahyadri region (Patnadevi, in Jalgaon district, Maharashtra).[11]\n History records his great-great-great-grandfather holding a hereditary post as a court scholar, as did his son and other descendants. His father Mahe\u015bvara[11] (Mahe\u015bvarop\u0101dhy\u0101ya[6])  was a mathematician, astronomer[6] and astrologer, who taught him mathematics, which he later passed on to his son Loksamudra. Loksamudra's son helped to set up a school in 1207 for the study of Bh\u0101skara's writings. He died in 1185 CE.\n The first section L\u012bl\u0101vat\u012b (also known as p\u0101\u1e6d\u012bga\u1e47ita or a\u1e45kaga\u1e47ita), named after his daughter, consists of 277 verses.[6] It covers calculations, progressions, measurement, permutations, and other topics.[6]\n The second section B\u012bjaga\u1e47ita(Algebra) has 213 verses.[6] It discusses zero, infinity, positive and negative numbers, and indeterminate equations including (the now called) Pell's equation, solving it using a ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka method.[6] In particular, he also solved the \n\n\n\n61\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n1\n=\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 61x^{2}+1=y^{2}}\n\n case that was to elude Fermat and his European contemporaries centuries later.[6]\n In the third section Grahaga\u1e47ita, while treating the motion of planets, he considered their instantaneous speeds.[6] He arrived at the approximation:[12] It consists of 451 verses\n In his words:[12]\n bimb\u0101rdhasya ko\u1e6dijy\u0101 gu\u1e47astrijy\u0101h\u0101ra\u1e25 phala\u1e43 dorjy\u0101yorantaram This result had also been observed earlier by Mu\u00f1jal\u0101c\u0101rya (or Ma\u00f1jul\u0101c\u0101rya) m\u0101nasam, in the context of a table of sines.[12]\n Bh\u0101skara also stated that at its highest point a planet's instantaneous speed is zero.[12]\n Some of Bhaskara's contributions to mathematics include the following:\n Bhaskara's arithmetic text L\u012bl\u0101vat\u012b covers the topics of definitions, arithmetical terms, interest computation, arithmetical and geometrical progressions, plane geometry, solid geometry, the shadow of the gnomon, methods to solve indeterminate equations, and combinations.\n L\u012bl\u0101vat\u012b is divided into 13 chapters and covers many branches of mathematics, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and a little trigonometry and measurement. More specifically the contents include:\n His work is outstanding for its systematisation, improved methods and the new topics that he introduced. Furthermore, the Lilavati contained excellent problems and it is thought that Bhaskara's intention may have been that a student of 'Lilavati' should concern himself with the mechanical application of the method.[citation needed]\n His B\u012bjaganita (\"Algebra\") was a work in twelve chapters. It was the first text to recognize that a positive number has two square roots (a positive and negative square root).[17] His work B\u012bjaganita is effectively a treatise on algebra and contains the following topics:\n Bhaskara derived a cyclic, chakravala method for solving indeterminate quadratic equations of the form ax2 + bx + c = y.[17] Bhaskara's method for finding the solutions of the problem Nx2 + 1 = y2 (the so-called \"Pell's equation\") is of considerable importance.[15]\n The Siddh\u0101nta Shiromani (written in 1150) demonstrates Bhaskara's knowledge of trigonometry, including the sine table and relationships between different trigonometric functions. He also developed spherical trigonometry, along with other interesting trigonometrical results. In particular Bhaskara seemed more interested in trigonometry for its own sake than his predecessors who saw it only as a tool for calculation. Among the many interesting results given by Bhaskara, results found in his works include computation of sines of angles of 18 and 36 degrees, and the now well known formulae for \n\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n\n(\n\na\n+\nb\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sin \\left(a+b\\right)}\n\n and \n\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n\n(\n\na\n\u2212\nb\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sin \\left(a-b\\right)}\n\n.\n His work, the Siddh\u0101nta Shiromani, is an astronomical treatise and contains many theories not found in earlier works.[citation needed] Preliminary concepts of infinitesimal calculus and mathematical analysis, along with a number of results in trigonometry, differential calculus and integral calculus that are found in the work are of particular interest.\n Evidence suggests Bhaskara was acquainted with some ideas of differential calculus.[17]  Bhaskara also goes deeper into the 'differential calculus' and suggests the differential coefficient vanishes at an extremum value of the function, indicating knowledge of the concept of 'infinitesimals'.[18]\n Madhava (1340\u20131425) and the Kerala School mathematicians (including Parameshvara) from the 14th century to the 16th century expanded on Bhaskara's work and further advanced the development of calculus in India.\n Using an astronomical model developed by Brahmagupta in the 7th century, Bh\u0101skara accurately defined many astronomical quantities, including, for example, the length of the sidereal year, the time that is required for the Earth to orbit the Sun, as approximately 365.2588 days which is the same as in Suryasiddhanta.[citation needed] The modern accepted measurement is 365.25636 days, a difference of just 3.5 minutes.[20]\n His mathematical astronomy text Siddhanta Shiromani is written in two parts: the first part on mathematical astronomy and the second part on the sphere.\n The twelve chapters of the first part cover topics such as:\n The second part contains thirteen chapters on the sphere. It covers topics such as:\n The earliest reference to a perpetual motion machine date back to 1150, when Bh\u0101skara II described a wheel that he claimed would run forever.[21]\n Bh\u0101skara II used a measuring device known as Ya\u1e63\u1e6di-yantra. This device could vary from a simple stick to V-shaped staffs designed specifically for determining angles with the help of a calibrated scale.[22]\n In his book Lilavati, he reasons: \"In this quantity also which has zero as its divisor there is no change even when many quantities have entered into it or come out [of it], just as at the time of destruction and creation when throngs of creatures enter into and come out of [him, there is no change in] the infinite and unchanging [Vishnu]\".[23]\n It has been stated, by several authors, that Bhaskara II proved the Pythagorean theorem by drawing a diagram and providing the single word \"Behold!\".[24][25] Sometimes Bhaskara's name is omitted and this is referred to as the Hindu proof, well known by schoolchildren.[26]\n However, as mathematics historian Kim Plofker points out, after presenting a worked out example, Bhaskara II states the Pythagorean theorem:\n Hence, for the sake of brevity, the square root of the sum of the squares of the arm and upright is the hypotenuse: thus it is demonstrated.[27]\n This is followed by:\n And otherwise, when one has set down those parts of the figure there [merely] seeing [it is sufficient].[27]\n Plofker suggests that this additional statement may be the ultimate source of the widespread \"Behold!\" legend.\n A number of institutes and colleges in India are named after him, including Bhaskaracharya Pratishthana in Pune, Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences in Delhi, Bhaskaracharya Institute For Space Applications and Geo-Informatics in Gandhinagar.\n On 20 November 1981 the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)  launched the Bhaskara II satellite honouring the mathematician and astronomer.[28]\n Invis Multimedia released Bhaskaracharya, an Indian documentary short on the mathematician in 2015.[29][30]\n ", "tags": ["12th-century Indian mathematicians", "12th-century Indian astronomers", "People from Bijapur, Karnataka", "1110s births", "1185 deaths", "Algebraists", "Scientists from Karnataka", "Scholars from Karnataka", "Acharyas", "CS1 uses Kannada-language script (kn)", "Harv and Sfn no-target errors", "Use dmy dates from June 2016", "Use Indian English from June 2016", "All Wikipedia articles written in Indian English", "Articles lacking reliable references from November 2015", "All articles lacking reliable references", "Articles needing additional references from November 2015", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with multiple maintenance issues", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from September 2012", "Articles with unsourced statements from September 2017", "Articles with unsourced statements from May 2013", "Articles with unsourced statements from September 2009", "CS1: long volume value", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nNot to be confused with Bh\u0101skara I.\nThis article has multiple issues.

Among the many interesting results given by Bhaskara, results found in his works include computation of sines of angles of 18 and 36 degrees, and the now well known formulae for \n\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n\n(\n\na\n+\nb\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sin \\left(a+b\\right)}\n\n and \n\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n\n(\n\na\n\u2212\nb\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sin \\left(a-b\\right)}\n\n.\n\nCalculus[edit]\nHis work, the Siddh\u0101nta Shiromani, is an astronomical treatise and contains many theories not found in earlier works.[citation needed] Preliminary concepts of infinitesimal calculus and mathematical analysis, along with a number of results in trigonometry, differential calculus and integral calculus that are found in the work are of particular interest.\nEvidence suggests Bhaskara was acquainted with some ideas of differential calculus.[17]  Bhaskara also goes deeper into the 'differential calculus' and suggests the differential coefficient vanishes at an extremum value of the function, indicating knowledge of the concept of 'infinitesimals'.[18]\n\nThere is evidence of an early form of Rolle's theorem in his work\nIf \n\n\n\nf\n\n(\na\n)\n\n=\nf\n\n(\nb\n)\n\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f\\left(a\\right)=f\\left(b\\right)=0}\n\n then \n\n\n\n\nf\n\u2032\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f'\\left(x\\right)=0}\n\n for some \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ x}\n\n with \n\n\n\n\u00a0\na\n<\nx\n<\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ a<x<b}\n\n\nHe gave the result that if \n\n\n\nx\n\u2248\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x\\approx y}\n\n then \n\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n(\ny\n)\n\u2212\nsin\n\u2061\n(\nx\n)\n\u2248\n(\ny\n\u2212\nx\n)\ncos\n\u2061\n(\ny\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sin(y)-\\sin(x)\\approx (y-x)\\cos(y)}\n\n, thereby finding the derivative of sine, although he never developed the notion of derivatives.[19]\nBhaskara uses this result to work out the position angle of the ecliptic, a quantity required for accurately predicting the time of an eclipse.\nIn computing the instantaneous motion of a planet, the time interval between successive positions of the planets was no greater than a truti, or a \u200b1\u204433750 of a second, and his measure of velocity was expressed in this infinitesimal unit of time.\nHe was aware that when a variable attains the maximum value, its differential vanishes.\nHe also showed that when a planet is at its farthest from the earth, or at its closest, the equation of the centre (measure of how far a planet is from the position in which it is predicted to be, by assuming it is to move uniformly) vanishes. He therefore concluded that for some intermediate position the differential of the equation of the centre is equal to zero.[citation needed] In this result, there are traces of the general mean value theorem, one of the most important theorems in analysis, which today is usually derived from Rolle's theorem. The mean value theorem was later found by Parameshvara in the 15th century in the Lilavati Bhasya, a commentary on Bhaskara's Lilavati.\nMadhava (1340\u20131425) and the Kerala School mathematicians (including Parameshvara) from the 14th century to the 16th century expanded on Bhaskara's work and further advanced the development of calculus in India.\n\nAstronomy[edit]\nUsing an astronomical model developed by Brahmagupta in the 7th century, Bh\u0101skara accurately defined many astronomical quantities, including, for example, the length of the sidereal year, the time that is required for the Earth to orbit the Sun, as approximately 365.2588 days which is the same as in Suryasiddhanta.[citation needed] The modern accepted measurement is 365.25636 days, a difference of just 3.5 minutes.[20]\nHis mathematical astronomy text Siddhanta Shiromani is written in two parts: the first part on mathematical astronomy and the second part on the sphere.\nThe twelve chapters of the first part cover topics such as:\n\nMean longitudes of the planets.\nTrue longitudes of the planets.\nThe three problems of diurnal rotation.(Diurnal motion is an astronomical term referring to the apparent daily motion of stars around the Earth, or more precisely around the two celestial poles. It is caused by the Earth's rotation on its axis, so every star apparently moves on a circle, that is called the diurnal circle.)\nSyzygies.\nLunar eclipses.\nSolar eclipses.\nLatitudes of the planets.\nSunrise equation\nThe Moon's crescent.\nConjunctions of the planets with each other.\nConjunctions of the planets with the fixed stars.\nThe paths of the Sun and Moon.\nThe second part contains thirteen chapters on the sphere. It covers topics such as:\n\nPraise of study of the sphere.\nNature of the sphere.\nCosmography and geography.\nPlanetary mean motion.\nEccentric epicyclic model of the planets.\nThe armillary sphere.\nSpherical trigonometry.\nEllipse calculations.[citation needed]\nFirst visibilities of the planets.\nCalculating the lunar crescent.\nAstronomical instruments.\nThe seasons.\nProblems of astronomical calculations.\nEngineering[edit]\nThe earliest reference to a perpetual motion machine date back to 1150, when Bh\u0101skara II described a wheel that he claimed would run forever.[21]\nBh\u0101skara II used a measuring device known as Ya\u1e63\u1e6di-yantra. This device could vary from a simple stick to V-shaped staffs designed specifically for determining angles with the help of a calibrated scale.[22]\n\nLegends[edit]\nIn his book Lilavati, he reasons: \"In this quantity also which has zero as its divisor there is no change even when many quantities have entered into it or come out [of it], just as at the time of destruction and creation when throngs of creatures enter into and come out of [him, there is no change in] the infinite and unchanging [Vishnu]\".[23]\n\n\"Behold!\"[edit]\nIt has been stated, by several authors, that Bhaskara II proved the Pythagorean theorem by drawing a diagram and providing the single word \"Behold!\".[24][25] Sometimes Bhaskara's name is omitted and this is referred to as the Hindu proof, well known by schoolchildren.[26]\nHowever, as mathematics historian Kim Plofker points out, after presenting a worked out example, Bhaskara II states the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nHence, for the sake of brevity, the square root of the sum of the squares of the arm and upright is the hypotenuse: thus it is demonstrated.[27]\n\nThis is followed by:\n\n\nAnd otherwise, when one has set down those parts of the figure there [merely] seeing [it is sufficient].[27]\n\n\nPlofker suggests that this additional statement may be the ultimate source of the widespread \"Behold!\" legend.\n\nLegacy[edit]\nA number of institutes and colleges in India are named after him, including Bhaskaracharya Pratishthana in Pune, Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences in Delhi, Bhaskaracharya Institute For Space Applications and Geo-Informatics in Gandhinagar.\nOn 20 November 1981 the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)  launched the Bhaskara II satellite honouring the mathematician and astronomer.[28]\nInvis Multimedia released Bhaskaracharya, an Indian documentary short on the mathematician in 2015.[29][30]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of Indian mathematicians\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Mathematical Achievements of Pre-modern Indian Mathematicians  by T.K Puttaswamy p.331\n\n^ Sahni 2019, p.\u00a050.\n\n^ Chopra 1982, pp.\u00a052\u201354.\n\n^ Plofker 2009, p.\u00a071.\n\n^ Poulose 1991, p.\u00a079.\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n S.
