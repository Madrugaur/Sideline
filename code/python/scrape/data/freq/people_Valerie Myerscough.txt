She applied for and was accepted to read mathematics at Royal Holloway College (RHC) aged 16, and graduated first-in-class aged 19, winning the University of London Lubbock Prize and Sherbrooke Prize. Some two years later she was awarded a PhD for a thesis entitled \"Continuous absorption by carbon negative ions and other quantal calculations\", supervised by M.R.C McDowell.[1]\n She worked first as in a post-doctoral post at Durham University, quickly followed by two years from 1965\u201367 as a Miller Fellow in the Department of Astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley. There, she sufficiently impressed to gain visiting positions over the next few years as Associate Professor at the University of Massachusetts; Research Scientist at the High Altitude Observatory at Boulder, Colorado; Professor at the University of Maryland, College Park; and professor at the University of Texas at Austin. These posts were in addition to a full-time position as lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at Queen Mary College (QMC), which she took up from 1967 onwards. There she taught a variety of theoretical physics and mathematics courses, and engaged in diverse research projects and collaborations, continuing the themes of her PhD.[1]\n She was a very active member of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), which she joined in 1963; she was awarded a fellowship in 1967.

Notably, she oversaw the restoration of the Herschel Room at Burlington House.[1]\n Throughout her life, she engaged fully in the societies in which she found herself; her obituary spoke of her as a care-free extrovert. At RHC she was a member of the Hockey and Netball teams; her visiting positions arose from her enthusiastic embrace American college life whilst at Berkeley. Her lectures at QMC were both erudite and witty, and she is remembered as a supportive member of faculty, concerned about the welfare of her students.
