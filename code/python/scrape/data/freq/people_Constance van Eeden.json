Kraft, another statistician;\nthe anti-nepotism rules then in force at many universities, including Michigan State, made it difficult for them both to find positions at the same place.[3] From 1961 until 1965 she was at the University of Minnesota, first as a research associate and then as an associate professor, and from 1965 to 1988 she taught at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\nShe retired in 1989, and has held visiting and honorary positions at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al and University of British Columbia since then.[2]\n With her husband, Charles H.
