{"name": "Jacob T.

He was the designer of the SETL programming language and started the NYU Ultracomputer project. He founded the New York University Department of Computer Science, chairing it from 1964 to 1980.[1]\n Schwartz was born in The Bronx, New York on January 9, 1930 to Ignatz and Hedwig Schwartz. He attended Stuyvesant High School and went on to City College of New York.[2]\n Schwartz received his B.S. (1949) from the City College of New York and his M.A. (1949) and Ph.D. (1951) from Yale University.\n Schwartz's research interests included the theory of linear operators, von Neumann algebras, quantum field theory, time-sharing, parallel computing, programming language design and implementation, robotics, set-theoretic approaches in computational logic, proof and program verification systems; multimedia authoring tools; experimental studies of visual perception; multimedia and other high-level software techniques for analysis and visualization of bioinformatic data.\n Schwartz authored 18 books and more than 100 papers and technical reports. He was also the inventor of the Artspeak programming language that historically ran on mainframes and produced graphical output using a single-color graphical plotter.[3]\n Schwartz served as chairman of the Computer Science Department (which he founded) at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, from 1969 to 1977.  He also served as chairman of the Computer Science Board of the National Research Council and was the former chairman of the National Science Foundation Advisory Committee for Information, Robotics and Intelligent Systems.  From 1986 to 1989, he was the director of DARPA's Information Science and Technology Office (DARPA/ISTO) in Arlington, Virginia.\n Schwartz was previously married to computer scientist Frances E. Allen from 1972 to 1982.\n ", "tags": ["1930 births", "2009 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Programming language designers", "City College of New York alumni", "Yale University alumni", "Yale University faculty", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences faculty", "Donegall Lecturers of Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin", "Harvard University staff", "Deaths from cancer in New York (state)", "Deaths from liver cancer", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Operator theorists", "Mathematicians from New York (state)", "Scientists from the Bronx", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from March 2013", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Semantic Scholar author identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
