{"name": "Andrzej Mostowski", "content": "Andrzej Mostowski (1 November 1913 \u2013 22 August 1975) was a Polish mathematician. He is perhaps best remembered for the Mostowski collapse lemma.\n Born in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary, Mostowski entered University of Warsaw in 1931. He was influenced by Kuratowski, Lindenbaum, and Tarski. His Ph.D. came in 1939, officially directed by Kuratowski but in practice directed by Tarski who was a young lecturer at that time.\n He became an accountant after the German invasion of Poland but continued working in the Underground Warsaw University. After the Warsaw uprising of 1944, the Nazis tried to put him in a concentration camp. With the help of some Polish nurses, he escaped to a hospital, choosing to take bread with him rather than his notebook containing his research. Some of this research he reconstructed after the War, however much of it remained lost.\n His work was largely on recursion theory and undecidability. From 1946 until his death in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, he worked at the University of Warsaw. Much of his work, during that time, was on first order logic and model theory.\n His son Tadeusz is also a mathematician working on differential geometry.[1] With Krzysztof Kurdyka and Adam Parusinski, Tadeusz Mostowski solved Ren\u00e9 Thom's gradient conjecture in 2000.\n \n ", "tags": ["1913 births", "1975 deaths", "Scientists from Lviv", "20th-century mathematicians", "Polish set theorists", "Polish logicians", "University of Warsaw alumni", "University of Warsaw faculty", "20th-century Polish philosophers", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Andrzej MostowskiMostowski in 1973Born(1913-11-01)1 November 1913Lemberg, Austria-HungaryDied22 August 1975(1975-08-22) (aged\u00a061)Vancouver, British Columbia, CanadaNationalityPolandAlma\u00a0materUniversity of WarsawKnown\u00a0forArithmetical hierarchyMostowski collapse lemmaScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of WarsawDoctoral advisorKazimierz KuratowskiAlfred TarskiDoctoral studentsAndrzej EhrenfeuchtMosh\u00e9 MachoverHelena RasiowaRoman Sikorski\n\nAndrzej Mostowski (1 November 1913 \u2013 22 August 1975) was a Polish mathematician.
