Mixter (August 7, 1906 \u2013 January 16, 2007) was an American scientist, noted for leading the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) away from anti-evolutionism, and for his advocacy of progressive creationism.\n Mixter graduated from Wheaton College, Illinois, in 1928 with a major in literature and a minor in biology. He thereafter gained an M.S. in zoology from Michigan State College and a Ph.D. in anatomy from the University of Illinois School of Medicine in Chicago, shortly after returning to Wheaton to teach.[1] He has been professor of zoology there since 1945, and was chairman of the Science Division from 1950 to 1961.[2]\n Wheaton College awards the Mixter Award for junior or senior biology majors in his honor, in recognition of his \"significant role in the development of biology at Wheaton College\".[3]\n Mixter joined the ASA in 1943,[1] served as its president from 1951\u201354,[2] and the editor of its journal from 1965\u20131968.[4]\n After a brief flirtation with flood geology, Mixter advocated the viewpoint that he called progressive creationism for the rest of his life. Along with Wheaton compatriot J.
