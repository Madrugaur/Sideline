{"name": "Kaisa Matom\u00e4ki", "content": "Kaisa Sofia Matom\u00e4ki (born April 30, 1985) is a Finnish mathematician specializing in number theory. Since September 2015, she has been working as an Academic Research Fellow in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. Her research includes results on the distribution of multiplicative functions over short intervals of numbers; for instance, she showed that the values of the M\u00f6bius function are evenly divided between +1 and \u22121 over short intervals. These results, in turn, were among the tools used by Terence Tao to prove the Erd\u0151s discrepancy problem.[1]\n Kaisa Matom\u00e4ki, along with Maksym Radziwill of McGill University, Canada, was awarded the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize for 2016.[2] The Prize was established in 2005 and is awarded annually for outstanding contributions by young mathematicians to areas influenced by Srinivasa Ramanujan.\n The citation for the 2016 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize is as follows: \"Kaisa Matom\u00e4ki and Maksym Radziwill are jointly awarded the 2016 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize for their deep and far reaching contributions to several important problems in diverse areas of number theory and especially for their spectacular collaboration which is revolutionizing the subject. The prize recognizes that in making significant improvements over the works of earlier stalwarts on long standing problems, they have introduced a number of innovative techniques. The prize especially recognizes  their collaboration starting with their 2015 joint paper in Geometric and Functional Analysis which led to their 2016 paper in the Annals of Mathematics in which they obtain amazing results on multiplicative functions in short intervals, and in particular a stunning result on the parity of the Liouville lambda function on almost all short intervals - a paper that is expected to change the subject of multiplicative functions in a major way. The prize notes also the very recent joint paper of Matom\u00e4ki, Radziwill and Tao announcing a significant advance in the case k = 3 towards a conjecture of Chowla on the values of the lambda function on sets of k consecutive integers. Finally the prize notes, that Matom\u00e4ki and Radziwill, through their impressive array of deep results and the powerful new techniques  they have introduced, will strongly influence the development of analytic number theory in the future.\"[3]\n With Radziwill, she is one of five winners of the 2019 New Horizons Prize for Early-Career Achievement in Mathematics, associated with the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics.[4] She is one of the 2020 winners of the EMS Prize.[5]\n Kaisa Matom\u00e4ki was born in Nakkila, Finland, on 30 April  1985. She attended high school in Valkeakoski, Finland and won the First Prize in the national mathematics competition for Finnish high school students. She did her Masters at the University of Turku and received the Ernst Lindelof Award for the best Masters Thesis in mathematics in Finland in 2005. After completing her PhD at the Royal Holloway College of the University of London in 2009 under the direction of Professor Glyn Harman, she returned to Turku where she is an Academy Research Fellow.[3][6][7]\n Kaisa Matom\u00e4ki is married to Pekka Matom\u00e4ki, who is also a mathematician specializing in applied mathematics.
