{"name": "Ed Lowe (businessman)", "content": "\n Edward Lowe (July 10, 1920 \u2013 October 4, 1995) was an American businessman and entrepreneur, noted for the invention of cat litter.[1] The Small Business School described him as \"building a huge business from nothing\",[2] and cites him as a textbook example of an individual who \"created a product, brought it to marketplace, invented an industry and sold his business for millions\".[3]  By the time of his death, his company was worth about five hundred million dollars (or $839 million today, adjusted for inflation).[4]\n Edward Lowe was born on July 10, 1920, in Saint Paul, Minnesota, to Lulu and Henry E. Lowe.[5] His family moved to Cassopolis, Michigan, where he attended high school at Cassopolis High School.\nHe had four children and six grandchildren.[4] He served in the US Navy in World War II.[6]\n Before Lowe's invention, people kept their cats outside, using ashes, dirt or sand as cat litter when it was necessary to keep them inside. One day in January 1947, Mrs. Draper, Edward Lowe's neighbor in Cassopolis, Michigan, asked him for some sand to use as cat litter. Her sand pile was frozen so she had been using ashes but they tracked all over her house. Instead of sand, Lowe gave her some clay called Fuller's Earth, a set of clay minerals capable of absorbing their weight in water. She found it worked far better than sand or ashes. In later years he worked on developing a litter product for chimpanzee waste with Jane Goodall, but was unable to develop a successful product.[7]\n In 1947, Lowe decided to sell the clay. He packaged it in five-pound (2.3\u00a0kg) bags and called it \"Kitty Litter\". He suggested that a local pet store sell it for 65\u00a0cents (or $7.44 today). The store owner refused, saying that it would not sell because sand was so much cheaper. Lowe told him to give it away free until people were willing to pay for it. Kitty Litter was a success. Lowe drove around the country selling Kitty Litter. He even cleaned boxes at cat shows so he could get a booth to demonstrate his product. He founded Edward Lowe Industries and created Tidy Cat cat box filler in 1964. In the early 1980s, he almost lost his market to Clorox, but by 1990, Edward Lowe Industries was the top producer of cat box filler.[5]\n In Lowe's later years, he decided the best way for his business to continue after his death was to hand the running over to a management team funded by venture capitalists from New York and Chicago.  The sale went through in 1990, with the company being renamed the Golden Cat Corporation; Lowe remained as an equity holder and director.[8] The sale was later estimated by The New York Times as being $200\u00a0million (or $391 million today).[4] Following his death, Golden Cat Corporation was sold to Ralston Purina.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1920 births", "1995 deaths", "United States Navy personnel of World War II", "Businesspeople from Saint Paul, Minnesota", "People from Cassopolis, Michigan", "20th-century American businesspeople", "20th-century American inventors", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2019", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Use mdy dates from July 2020", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\n Edward Lowe\nEdward Lowe (July 10, 1920 \u2013 October 4, 1995) was an American businessman and entrepreneur, noted for the invention of cat litter.[1] The Small Business School described him as \"building a huge business from nothing\",[2] and cites him as a textbook example of an individual who \"created a product, brought it to marketplace, invented an industry and sold his business for millions\".[3]  By the time of his death, his company was worth about five hundred million dollars (or $839 million today, adjusted for inflation).[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n2 Invention of cat litter\n3 Career\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nBackground[edit]\nEdward Lowe was born on July 10, 1920, in Saint Paul, Minnesota, to Lulu and Henry E.
