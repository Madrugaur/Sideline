He is credited with creating \"arbonite\" (i.e. plywood), the first \"plastic\" materials (e.g. gutta percha) pre-date 1906 plastic in the world.\n He was born in Wieselburg, Austria to a Serbian noble family residing in Pest, Hungary, but spent most of his life in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\n He is credited with creating \"arbonite\" (i.e. plywood), the first \"plastic\" materials (e.g. gutta percha) pre-date 1906 plastic in the world. \nKostovi\u0107 patented the technology of the production of arbonite in the USA on 4 September 1906.[citation needed] In the early 1880s he designed and attempted to construct a dirigible (airship),[1] about 20 years before Ferdinand von Zeppelin. His flight vehicle was destroyed in a fire and it was never tested in the air. He also developed and constructed a large gasoline engine for his dirigible.[1] In 1879 he demonstrated his flying models of a helicopter, aircraft and ornithopter, while in 1881 approached the building of an aircraft.[citation needed] In the catalog of aeronautical exhibition 1911 and in the article of G.V. Piotrovski it is said, that Kostovi\u0107 actually constructed a flight vehicle.[citation needed] The same was also said in A.

He celebrated the slava of Saint Nicholas every year and one of his regular guests was Dmitri Mendeleev.\n One of his daughters married a Serbian officer and, during the First World War, she became, together with Nade\u017eda Petrovi\u0107, a voluntary nurse. Two of his daughters lived in Belgrade.\n When he died in December 1916 in Saint Petersburg, the press reported that \"a brilliant inventor and scientist has disappeared, a man who has, for many reasons, deserved that future generations remember his unusual destiny and scientific achievements\".[citation needed]\n ", "tags": ["Austro-Hungarian emigrants to the Russian Empire", "Austro-Hungarian inventors", "Austro-Hungarian scientists", "Serbs of Hungary", "Serbian inventors", "Serbian scientists", "Aviation inventors", "People of the Russian Empire of Serbian descent", "People from Pest, Hungary", "People from Saint Petersburg", "Balloonists of the Russian Empire", "Inventors of the Russian Empire", "Scientists of the Russian Empire", "1851 births", "1916 deaths", "Austro-Hungarian Serbs", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from March 2018", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles with Russian-language sources (ru)", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from October 2015", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " Ogneslav Stepanovi\u0107 Kostovi\u0107\nIn this Eastern Slavic name, the patronymic is  Stepanovi\u0107 and the family name is  Kostovi\u0107.\nOgnjeslav Stepanovi\u0107 Kostovi\u0107 (Serbian Cyrillic: \u041e\u0433\u045a\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b) (1851 \u2013 16 December 1916) was a Serbian-Russian inventor.
