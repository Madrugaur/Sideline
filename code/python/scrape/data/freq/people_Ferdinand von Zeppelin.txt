Zepelin, the family's eponymous hometown, is a small community outside the town of B\u00fctzow in Mecklenburg.\n Ferdinand was the son of W\u00fcrttemberg Minister and Hofmarschall Friedrich Jer\u00f4me Wilhelm Karl Graf von Zeppelin (1807\u20131886) and his wife Am\u00e9lie Fran\u00e7oise Pauline (born Macaire d'Hogguer) (1816\u20131852). Ferdinand spent his childhood with his sister and brother at their Girsberg manor near Konstanz, where he was educated by private tutors[2] and lived there until his death. On 7 August 1869 Ferdinand married Isabella Freiin von Wolff in Berlin. She was from the house of Alt-Schwanenburg (present-day \u2014 Gulbene town in Latvia, then part of Livonia).[3] They had a daughter, Helene (Hella) von Zeppelin (1879\u20131967) who in 1909 married Alexander Graf von Brandenstein-Zeppelin (1881\u20131949).\n Ferdinand had a nephew Baron Max von Gemmingen who was to later volunteer at the start of World War I, after he was past military age, to become general staff officer assigned to the military airship LZ 12 Sachsen.[4]\n In 1853 Count Zeppelin left to attend the polytechnic at Stuttgart, and in 1855 he became a cadet of the military school at Ludwigsburg and then started his career as an army officer in the army of W\u00fcrttemberg.[2]\n By 1858, Zeppelin had been promoted to lieutenant, and that year he was given leave to study science, engineering and chemistry at T\u00fcbingen. The Prussians' mobilising for the Austro-Sardinian War interrupted this study in 1859 when he was called up to the Ingenieurkorps (Prussian engineering corps) at Ulm.[5]\n In 1863 Zeppelin took leave to act as an observer for the Union's Army of the Potomac in the American Civil War in Virginia. Later, he travelled to the Upper Midwest with a party that probably included two Russians. Led by Native American (probably Ojibwe) guides, they canoed and portaged from the western end of Lake Superior up the St. Louis River and across to Crow Wing, Minnesota, on the Upper Mississippi River. On reaching St. Paul (via stagecoach and hired carriage), Zeppelin encountered German-born itinerant balloonist John Steiner and made his first aerial ascent with him from a site near the International Hotel in downtown St. Paul on 19 August.[citation needed] Many years later he attributed the beginning of his thinking about dirigible lighter-than-air craft to this experience.[6][7]\n In 1865 Zeppelin was appointed adjutant of the King of W\u00fcrttemberg and as general staff officer participated in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. He was awarded the Ritterkreuz (Knight's Cross) of the Order of Distinguished Service of W\u00fcrttemberg.[2] In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u20131871 a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines, during which he narrowly avoided capture, made him famous among Germans.[8]\n From 1882 until 1885 Zeppelin was commander of the 19th Uhlans in Ulm, and was then appointed to be the envoy of W\u00fcrttemberg in Berlin. In 1890 he gave up this post to return to army service, being given command of a Prussian cavalry brigade. His handling of this at the 1890 autumn manoeuvres was severely criticised and he was forced to retire from the Army,[9] albeit with the rank of generalleutnant.\n Ferdinand von Zeppelin served as an official observer with the Union Army during the American Civil War.[10] During the Peninsular Campaign, he visited the balloon camp of Thaddeus S. C. Lowe shortly after Lowe's services were terminated by the Army. Von Zeppelin then travelled to St. Paul, MN where the German-born former Army balloonist John Steiner offered tethered flights. His first ascent in a balloon, made at Saint Paul, Minnesota during this visit, is said to have been the inspiration of his later interest in aeronautics.[6]\n Zeppelin's ideas for large airships were first expressed in a diary entry dated 25 March 1874. Inspired by a recent lecture given by Heinrich von Stephan on the subject of \"World Postal Services and Air Travel\", he outlined the basic principle of his later craft: a large rigidly-framed outer envelope containing a number of separate gasbags.[11]  In 1887 the success of Charles Renard and Arthur Krebs' airship La France prompted him to send a letter to the King of W\u00fcrttemberg about the military necessity for dirigibles and the lack of German development in this field.[12]\n After his resignation from the army in 1891 at age 52, Zeppelin devoted his full attention to airships.[10][13] He hired the engineer Theodor Gross to make tests of possible materials and to assess available engines for both fuel efficiency and power-to-weight ratio. He also had air propellers tested and strove to obtain higher purity hydrogen gas from suppliers.[14] Zeppelin was so confident of his concept that in June 1891 he wrote to the King of W\u00fcrttemberg's secretary, announcing he was to start building, and shortly after requested a review from the Prussian Army's Chief of General Staff. The next day Zeppelin almost gave up as he realized he had underestimated air resistance,[15] but resumed work on hearing that Rudolf Hans Bartsch von Sigsfeld made light but powerful engines, information soon shown to be overoptimistic. Whereupon Zeppelin urged his supporter Max von Duttenhofer to press Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft for more efficient engines so as not to fall behind the French.[16] Duttenhofer wrote to Gross threatening to withdraw support, and Zeppelin shortly afterwards sacked Gross, citing Gross' lack of support and writing that he was \"an obstacle in my path\".[16]\n Despite these setbacks Zeppelin's organization had refined his idea: a rigid aluminium framework covered in a fabric envelope; separate multiple internal gas cells, each free to expand and contract thus obviating the need for ballonets; modular frame allowing addition of sections and gas cells; controls, engines and gondola rigidly attached. After publishing the idea in March 1892 he hired the engineer Theodor Kober who started work testing and further refining the design.[17] Zeppelin submitted Kober's 1893 detailed designs to the Prussian Airship Service,[18] whose committee reviewed it in 1894.[18] In June 1895 this committee recommended minimum funds be granted, but withdrew this offer and rejected the design in July.[19]\n One month later, in August 1895, Zeppelin received a patent for Kober's design, described as an \"airship-train\" (Lenkbarer Luftfahrzug mit mehreren hintereinanderen angeordneten Tragk\u00f6rpern [Steerable airship-train with several carrier structures arranged one behind another].)[20][21]  The patent describes an airship consisting of three rigid sections flexibly connected. The front section, intended to contain the crew and engines, was 117.35\u00a0m (385.0\u00a0ft) long with a gas capacity of 9514\u00a0cu\u00a0m (336,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft): the middle section was 16\u00a0m (52\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) long with an intended useful load of 599\u00a0kg (1,321\u00a0lb) and the rear section 39.93\u00a0m (131.0\u00a0ft) long with an intended load of 1,996\u00a0kg (4,400\u00a0lb)[22]\n In early 1896, Zeppelin's lecture on steerable airship designs given to the Association of German Engineers (VDI) so impressed them that the VDI launched a public appeal for financial support for him.[21] This led to a first contact with Carl Berg who supplied aluminium alloys which Zeppelin had tested, and by May 1898 they, together with Philipp Holzmann,[23] Daimler, Max von Eyth, Carl von Linde, and Friedrich Voith, had formed the joint stock company Gesellschaft zur F\u00f6rderung der Luftschiffart.[21] Zeppelin invested 441,000 Marks, over half the total capital.[21][23] Actual construction then started of what was to be the first successful rigid airship, the Zeppelin LZ1.\n Berg's involvement with the project would later be the cause of allegations that Zeppelin had used the patent and designs of David Schwarz's airship of 1897. Berg had signed a contract with Schwartz under the terms of which he undertook not to supply aluminium to any other airship manufacturer. He later made a payment to Schwartz's widow as compensation for dissolving this arrangement.[24]  Claims that Zeppelin had been influenced by Schwartz were denied by Eckener in 1938[25] and also rejected by later historians. Zeppelin's design was \"radically different\"[26] in both its scale and its framework from that of Schwarz.\n On 2 July 1900, Zeppelin made the first flight with the LZ\u00a01 over Lake Constance near Friedrichshafen in southern Germany. The airship rose from the ground and remained in the air for 20 minutes, but was damaged on landing. After repairs and some modifications two further flights were made by LZ\u00a01 in October 1900, However the airship was not considered successful enough to justify investment by the government, and since the experiments had exhausted Count Zeppelins funds, he was forced to suspend his work.[27]\n Zeppelin still enjoyed the support of the King of W\u00fcrttemberg, who authorised a state lottery which raised 124,000 marks. A contribution of 50,000 marks was received from Prussia, and Zeppelin raised the remainder of the necessary money by mortgaging his wife's estates. Still supported by Daimler and Carl Berg, construction of his second airship, the LZ\u00a02, was started in April 1905. It was completed by 30 November, when it was first taken out of its hangar, but a ground-handling mishap caused the bows to be pulled into the water, damaging the forward control surfaces. Repairs were completed by 17 January 1906, when LZ\u00a02 made its only flight. Too much ballast was jettisoned on takeoff, causing the airship to rise to an altitude of 427\u00a0m (1,401\u00a0ft). Here a stiff breeze was encountered, and although the airship was at first able to overcome this, the failure of the forward engine due to cooling problems followed by the failure of the other due to a broken clutch-spring left the airship at the mercy of the wind. It was brought down near Kisslegg in the Allg\u00e4u mountains, with some damage caused by the stern's striking some trees during mooring, but was more severely damaged by high winds the following night, and had to be dismantled.[28]\n In May 1906, work as started on a third airship, LZ\u00a03. This was the same size and configuration as LZ\u00a02, but had a greater gas capacity. Finished by the end of the year, it made two successful flights at a speed of 30 miles per hour (48\u00a0km/h), and in 1907 attained a speed of 36 miles per hour (58\u00a0km/h).[10] The success of LZ\u00a03 produced a change in the official attitude to his work, and the Reichstag voted that he should be awarded 500,000 marks to continue his work.[29]  However the purchase by the Government of an airship was made conditional on the successful completion of a 24\u2011hour trial flight. Knowing that this was beyond the capabilities of LZ\u00a03, work was started on a larger airship, the LZ\u00a04. This first flew on 20 June 1908. The final financial breakthrough only came after the Zeppelin LZ\u00a04 was destroyed by fire at Echterdingen after breaking free of its moorings during a storm. The airship's earlier flights had excited public interest in the development of the airships, and a subsequent collection campaign raised over 6\u00a0million German marks. The money was used to create the 'Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin GmbH' and the Zeppelin foundation (Zeppelin Stiftung).[30]\n Following the destruction of LZ\u00a04, LZ\u00a03, which had been damaged when the floating hangar broke free of its mooring during a storm, was repaired: at the same time it was lengthened by 8\u00a0m. It was re-inflated on 21 October 1908 and after a series of short test flights a flight lasting 5\u00a0hours 55\u00a0minutes took place on 27 October with the Kaiser's brother, Admiral Prince Heinrich, on board. On 7 November, with Crown Prince William as a passenger,[31]\nit flew 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) to Donaueschingen, where the Kaiser was then staying. In spite of poor weather conditions, the flight succeeded: two days later LZ\u00a03 was officially accepted by the Government and on 10 November Zeppelin was rewarded with an official visit to Friedrichshafen by the Kaiser, during which a short demonstration flight over Lake Constance was made and Zeppelin awarded the Order of the Black Eagle.[32]\n Although a replacement for LZ 4, the LZ\u00a05 was built and accepted into Army service as L\u00a0II, Zeppelin's relationship with the military authorities continued to be poor, and deteriorated considerably due to his criticism of the Army following the loss of L\u00a0II, which was carried away from its moorings and wrecked on 25 April 1910.[33] However, the business director of Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin, Alfred Colsman, came up with a scheme to capitalise on the public enthusiasm for Zeppelin's airships by establishing a passenger-carrying business.\n Up until 1914 the German Aviation Association (Deutsche Luftschiffahrtsgesellschaft or DELAG) transported 37,250\u00a0people on over 1,600 flights without an incident.[34] Within a few years the zeppelin revolution began creating the age of air transportation.\n Count Everhard von Zeppelin, Second Lieutenant in the German Lancers, married November 1895,\nMamie McGarvey, daughter of William H. McGarvey, owner of the oil wells of Galicia and his wife, Helena J. Wesolowska.\nA former Count von Zeppelin married a granddaughter of the 1st Earl of Ranfurly.[35]\n Count Zeppelin died in 1917, before the end of World War I, therefore he did not witness either the provisional shutdown of the Zeppelin project due to the Treaty of Versailles or the second resurgence of the Zeppelins under his successor Hugo Eckener.\nThe unfinished World War II German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin, and two rigid airships, the world-circling LZ\u00a0127 Graf Zeppelin, and LZ\u00a0130 Graf Zeppelin II, twin to the Hindenburg, were named after him.\n The name of the British rock group Led Zeppelin derives from his airship as well.  His granddaughter Countess Eva von Zeppelin once threatened to sue them for illegal use of their family name while they were performing in Copenhagen.[36]\n A 1974 episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus (Series 4, Episode 1, The Golden Age Of Ballooning) features a skit in which Count Zeppelin (Graham Chapman) has taken various members of the government up in his ship for a promotional flight, only to get angry and throw each guest out of the ship's gondola (while still in the air) over the perceived insult of everyone referring to the craft as a balloon instead of his preferred airship or Zeppelin.\n In 1975, Zeppelin was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame.[37]\n Works cited\n ", "tags": ["1838 births", "1917 deaths", "19th-century German people", "20th-century German people", "German airship aviators", "Aviation pioneers", "German balloonists", "Airship designers", "German company founders", "20th-century German businesspeople", "German industrialists", "People from Konstanz", "People from the Grand Duchy of Baden", "People of the American Civil War", "Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)", "Counts of Germany", "Members of the W\u00fcrttembergian Chamber of Lords", "Generals of Cavalry of W\u00fcrttemberg", "Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Russia)", "Grand Crosses of the House Order of the Wendish Crown", "Recipients of the Iron Cross (1870), 2nd class", "Grand Crosses of the Order of the Dannebrog", "Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Recipients of the Order of St. Anna, 1st class", "Recipients of the Order of St. Vladimir, 3rd class", "German expatriates in the United States", "Zeppelin family", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the Encyclopedia Americana with a Wikisource reference", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1922 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from October 2014", "Articles containing German-language text", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from November 2015", "Commons link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Several terms  redirect here.

The money was used to create the 'Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin GmbH' and the Zeppelin foundation (Zeppelin Stiftung).[30]\nFollowing the destruction of LZ\u00a04, LZ\u00a03, which had been damaged when the floating hangar broke free of its mooring during a storm, was repaired: at the same time it was lengthened by 8\u00a0m. It was re-inflated on 21 October 1908 and after a series of short test flights a flight lasting 5\u00a0hours 55\u00a0minutes took place on 27 October with the Kaiser's brother, Admiral Prince Heinrich, on board. On 7 November, with Crown Prince William as a passenger,[31]\nit flew 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) to Donaueschingen, where the Kaiser was then staying. In spite of poor weather conditions, the flight succeeded: two days later LZ\u00a03 was officially accepted by the Government and on 10 November Zeppelin was rewarded with an official visit to Friedrichshafen by the Kaiser, during which a short demonstration flight over Lake Constance was made and Zeppelin awarded the Order of the Black Eagle.[32]\nAlthough a replacement for LZ 4, the LZ\u00a05 was built and accepted into Army service as L\u00a0II, Zeppelin's relationship with the military authorities continued to be poor, and deteriorated considerably due to his criticism of the Army following the loss of L\u00a0II, which was carried away from its moorings and wrecked on 25 April 1910.[33] However, the business director of Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin, Alfred Colsman, came up with a scheme to capitalise on the public enthusiasm for Zeppelin's airships by establishing a passenger-carrying business.\nUp until 1914 the German Aviation Association (Deutsche Luftschiffahrtsgesellschaft or DELAG) transported 37,250\u00a0people on over 1,600 flights without an incident.[34] Within a few years the zeppelin revolution began creating the age of air transportation.\n\nOther aircraft[edit]\n1899 unrealised plans for a paddlewheel aeroplane[21]\n1912 financial support of Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen which was to supply 850 aeroplanes 1917/1918;[21]\n1914 commissions Claude Dornier to develop flying boats[21]\n1914 founds Versuchsbau Gotha-Ost with Robert Bosch which built a number of Riesenflugzeug (giant aircraft) such as the Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI[21]\nFamily[edit]\nCount Everhard von Zeppelin, Second Lieutenant in the German Lancers, married November 1895,\nMamie McGarvey, daughter of William H. McGarvey, owner of the oil wells of Galicia and his wife, Helena J. Wesolowska.\nA former Count von Zeppelin married a granddaughter of the 1st Earl of Ranfurly.[35]\n\nLegacy[edit]\n Bust of Zeppelin in the Aeronauticum at Nordholz\nCount Zeppelin died in 1917, before the end of World War I, therefore he did not witness either the provisional shutdown of the Zeppelin project due to the Treaty of Versailles or the second resurgence of the Zeppelins under his successor Hugo Eckener.\nThe unfinished World War II German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin, and two rigid airships, the world-circling LZ\u00a0127 Graf Zeppelin, and LZ\u00a0130 Graf Zeppelin II, twin to the Hindenburg, were named after him.\nThe name of the British rock group Led Zeppelin derives from his airship as well.  His granddaughter Countess Eva von Zeppelin once threatened to sue them for illegal use of their family name while they were performing in Copenhagen.[36]\nA 1974 episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus (Series 4, Episode 1, The Golden Age Of Ballooning) features a skit in which Count Zeppelin (Graham Chapman) has taken various members of the government up in his ship for a promotional flight, only to get angry and throw each guest out of the ship's gondola (while still in the air) over the perceived insult of everyone referring to the craft as a balloon instead of his preferred airship or Zeppelin.\nIn 1975, Zeppelin was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame.[37]\n\nSee also[edit]\nAirship\nZeppelin\nHindenburg disaster\nTimeline of hydrogen technologies\nGerman inventors and discoverers\nDavid Schwarz (aviation inventor)\nCepelinai\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Katalog der Deutschen Nationalbibliothek\" (in German).
