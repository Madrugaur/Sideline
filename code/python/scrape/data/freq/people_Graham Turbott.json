{"name": "Graham Turbott", "content": "\n Evan Graham Turbott QSO (27 May 1914 \u2013 12 December 2014), generally known as Graham Turbott, was a New Zealand ornithologist, zoologist, and museum administrator. He served as director of the Auckland Institute and Museum from 1964 to 1979.\n Born at Stanley Bay on Auckland's North Shore, Turbott was the eldest of the three sons of Thomas Turbott, a primary school headmaster, and his wife Evangeline Alice Turbott (n\u00e9e Graham).[1] His brothers included the diplomat and businessman Ian Turbott. He was educated at Takapuna Grammar School, and went on to study at Auckland Teachers' Training College and Auckland University College.[1] He graduated from the latter institution with a Master of Science in zoology in 1938.[1][2]  His thesis was entitled Some observations on the distribution and anatomy of Leiopelma hochstetteri Fitzinger.\n On 7 September 1940, Turbott married the ethnologist Olwyn Mary Rutherford at All Saints' Church, Howick.[3]\n In 1937 Turbott was appointed as assistant zoologist at Auckland War Memorial Museum.[4] In 1944 he spent a year on coast-watching duties in the subantarctic Auckland Islands as part of the Cape Expedition, which also included Charles Fleming and Robert Falla, but he also found time to pursue his interest in natural history.[1] He later wrote about the experience in the book Year Away: Wartime coast watching on the Auckland Islands, 1944, published in 2002.[5]\n Turbott returned and continued at Auckland Museum, until becoming assistant director of Canterbury Museum, Christchurch in 1957. He returned in 1964 to take up the post of director of the Auckland Institute and Museum, succeeding Sir Gilbert Archey. He remained there until he retired in 1979,[1] when he was named as the museum's director emeritus.[6]\n Turbott wrote or co-authored several ornithological works, including New Zealand bird life (1947), Buller's birds of New Zealand (2nd updated edition, 1967, as editor), A field guide to the birds of New Zealand and outlying Islands (1970, with Robert Falla), The new guide to the birds of New Zealand and outlying islands (1979, with Falla), Collins guide to the birds of New Zealand and outlying islands (1981, with Falla), Birds of New Zealand (1990, with Falla), and Checklist of the birds of New Zealand and the Ross Dependency, Antarctica (1990).\n A founding member of the Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Turbott served as its president from 1949 to 1952, North Island vice president from 1947 to 1949 and 1957 to 1958, and a councillor between 1953 and 1955.[1]\n Turbott died on 12 December 2014.[1]\n In the 1978 New Year Honours, Turbott was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services, in recognition of his role as director of the Auckland Institute and Museum.[7] He was bestowed with the Robert Falla Memorial Award by the Ornithological Society of New Zealand in 1988, and made a fellow of the same organisation in 1997.[1] In 2014, Turbott was the recipient of a lifetime achievement award from Auckland Museum.[6]\n Almost 20 species, mostly invertebrates from New Zealand offshore islands,[1] that were collected by Turbott have been named in his honour, including:[8][9]\n Lake Turbott, on Adams Island in the Auckland Islands, was also named after Turbott.[1]\n ", "tags": ["1914 births", "2014 deaths", "People from Auckland", "People educated at Takapuna Grammar School", "University of Auckland alumni", "New Zealand zoologists", "Directors of museums in New Zealand", "Companions of the Queen's Service Order", "New Zealand centenarians", "People associated with the Auckland War Memorial Museum", "Directors of the Auckland War Memorial Museum", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from April 2016", "Use New Zealand English from April 2016", "All Wikipedia articles written in New Zealand English", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with TePapa identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "New Zealand zoologist\n\n\nGraham TurbottQSOGraham Turbott, 1975[a]BornEvan Graham Turbott(1914-05-27)27 May 1914Stanley Bay, New ZealandDied12 December 2014(2014-12-12) (aged\u00a0100)Auckland, New ZealandAlma\u00a0materAuckland University College (MSc)Spouse(s)Olwyn Mary Rutherford\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01940; died\u00a01994)\u200bScientific careerFieldsOrnithology, zoologyInstitutionsAuckland War Memorial MuseumCanterbury MuseumThesisSome observations on the distribution and anatomy of Leiopelma hochstetteri Fitzinger\u00a0(1937)\nRelativesIan Turbott (brother)\nEvan Graham Turbott QSO (27 May 1914 \u2013 12 December 2014), generally known as Graham Turbott, was a New Zealand ornithologist, zoologist, and museum administrator.
