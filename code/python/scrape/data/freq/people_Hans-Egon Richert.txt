{"name": "Hans-Egon Richert", "content": "Hans-Egon Richert (June 2, 1924 \u2013 November 25, 1993) was a German mathematician who worked primarily in analytic number theory. He is the author (with Heini Halberstam) of a definitive book[1] on sieve theory.\n Hans-Egon Richert was born in 1924 in Hamburg, Germany. He attended the University of Hamburg and received his Ph.D under Max Deuring in 1950. He held a temporary chair at the University of G\u00f6ttingen and then a newly created chair at the University of Marburg. In 1972 he moved to the University of Ulm, where he remained until his retirement in 1991. He died on November 25, 1993 in Blaustein, near Ulm, Germany.[2]\n Richert worked primarily in analytic number theory, and beginning around 1965 started a collaboration with Heini Halberstam and shifted his focus to sieve theory. For many years he was a chairman of the Analytic Number Theory meetings at the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach.[2]\n Richert made contributions to additive number theory, Dirichlet series, Riesz summability, the multiplicative analog of the Erd\u0151s\u2013Fuchs theorem, estimates of the number of non-isomorphic abelian groups, and bounds for exponential sums. He proved the exponent 15/46 for the Dirichlet divisor problem, a record that stood for many years.[2]\n One of Richert's notable results was the Jurkat\u2013Richert theorem, joint work with Wolfgang B.
