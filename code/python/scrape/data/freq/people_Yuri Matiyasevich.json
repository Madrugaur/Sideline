(November 2019)\nIn 1962\u20131963, Matiyasevich studied at Saint Petersburg Lyceum 239;\nIn 1963\u20131964, he studied at Kolmogorov School; in 1964 was absolute winner of the All-Union Olympiad in mathematics\nIn 1964\u20131969, Matiyasevich studied at Mathematics & Mechanics Faculty of Leningrad State University. By qualifying for the USSR team to the International Mathematical Olympiad (where he won a gold medal), Yuri Matiyasevich was accepted without exams to Leningrad State University, skipping the last year of high school studies.\nIn 1966, he presented a talk at International Congress of Mathematicians held in Moscow. He was a second-year undergraduate student at that time.\nIn 1969\u20131970, he pursued doctoral studies at Leningrad Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics under supervision of Sergey Maslov.\nIn 1970, he received his doctorate (Candidate degree, equivalent to Ph.D) at LOMI and gave an invited talk at International Congress of Mathematicians held in Nice on Undecidability of Hibert's tenth problem.\nIn 1970\u20131974, he was a researcher at LOMI.\nIn 1972, he obtained a second doctoral degree (equivalent to habilitation or D.Sc, called \"doktor nauk\" in Soviet Union).\nIn 1974\u20131980, he was a senior researcher at LOMI.\nIn 1980-2018, Yuri Matiyasevich was the head of Laboratory of mathematical logic at LOMI.\nSince 1995, he has been a professor of Saint Petersburg State University, initially at the chair of software engineering, later at the chair of algebra and number theory.\nIn 1997, he was elected as a corresponding member of Russian Academy of Sciences.\nSince 1998, Yuri Matiyasevich has been a vice-president of St. Petersburg Mathematical Society.\nSince 2002, he has been a head of St.Petersburg City Mathematical Olympiad.\nSince 2003, Matiyasevich has been a co-director of annual German\u2013Russian student school JASS.\nIn 2008, he was elected as a full member of Russian Academy of Sciences.\nAwards and honors[edit]\n1964: Gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad held in Moscow.\n1970:  \"Young mathematician prize\" of the Leningrad Mathematical Society.[1]\n1980: Markov Prize of Academy of Sciences of the USSR.\n1996: Honorary Degree, Universit\u00e9 d'Auvergne.\n1998: He received Humboldt Research Award.\n2003: Honorary Degree, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC).\n2007: Member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences.\nNotable facts[edit]\nA polynomial related to the colorings of a triangulation of a sphere was named after Matiyasevich; see The Matiyasevich polynomial, four colour theorem and weight systems.\nHe was a member of the American Mathematical Society and the Association for Symbolic Logic; and also of the editorial boards for the journals Discrete Mathematics and Applications and Computer Instruments in Education.\nNotable students include: Eldar Musayev, Maxim Vsemirnov, Alexei Pastor, Dmitri Karpov.\nSelected works[edit]\nBook[edit]\nYuri Matiyasevich Hilbert's 10th Problem, Foreword by Martin Davis and Hilary Putnam, The MIT Press, 1993.
