{"name": "Paul V. Roberts", "content": "Paul V. Roberts (November 27, 1938 - February 2006) was a prominent environmental engineer. He made major contributions to environmental engineering by applying fundamental principles of mass transport and chemistry to drinking water treatment and wastewater reclamation research. An author of more than 200 scientific publications, he was a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the Swiss Academy of Sciences.\n Paul Roberts graduated with a BS degree in chemical engineering from Princeton University in 1960, and received a Ph.D. degree in chemical engineering from Cornell University in 1966.[1]  He taught at the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Valpara\u00edso and the Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda in Chile, and worked as a process engineer with Chevron Research Company in Richmond, California. In 1968, he joined the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park. After he received a M.S. degree in environmental engineering at Stanford University in 1971,[1] he joined the Swiss Federal Institute of Water Supply and Water Pollution Control.[1]  In 1976 he left his position as the head of the engineering department at the Institute and began his career at Stanford. In 1989 Roberts was named the C.L. Peck, Class of 1906 Professor in the School of Engineering. He died of leukemia in February, 2006, at his home in Cupertino.[2]\n Paul Roberts was a pioneer in applying fundamental principles of mass transport and chemistry to engineered environmental systems. His broad body of work spans such topics as reclaimed wastewater, drinking water disinfection, adsorption and volatilization of organic contaminants during water and wastewater treatment, contaminant transport in groundwater, and multiphase flow in porous media. He is perhaps best known for conceiving and directing the first and probably the most definitive field study ever conducted on the movement and fate of hazardous chemicals in groundwater at the Borden site in Canada. In this study, his team clearly demonstrated the scientific value of carefully designed large-scale field experiments to test hypotheses, to validate mathematical models, to generate understanding of important natural processes, and to uncover still more important questions in need of better theoretical understanding.\n In addition to his individual research contributions Paul was an accomplished teacher and mentor.\n An obituary (page 5) in the newsletter of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors.\n ", "tags": ["1938 births", "2006 deaths", "Cornell University College of Engineering alumni", "Princeton University alumni", "Stanford University School of Engineering faculty", "Stanford University alumni", "Systems ecologists", "Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara\u00edso faculty"], "raw": "For other people named Paul Roberts, see Paul Roberts (disambiguation).\nPaul V.
