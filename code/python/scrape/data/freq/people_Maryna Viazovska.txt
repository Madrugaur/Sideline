She is currently full professor at the Chair of Number Theory at Institute of Mathematics of \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne in Switzerland.[3]\n Viazovska was born in Kiev, and attended a specialized secondary school for high-achieving students in science and technology, Kyiv Natural Science Lyceum No. 145. An influential teacher there, Andrii Knyazyuk, had previously worked as a professional research mathematician before becoming a secondary school teacher.[4]\nAs a student at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, she competed at the International Mathematics Competition for University Students in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005, and was one of the first-place winners in 2002 and 2005.[5]\n Viazovska earned a candidate degree from the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in 2010,[1] a master's from the University of Kaiserslautern, and a doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) from the University of Bonn in 2013. Her doctoral dissertation, Modular Functions and Special Cycles, concerns analytic number theory and was supervised by Don Zagier and Werner M\u00fcller.[6]\n She was a postdoctoral researcher at the Berlin Mathematical School and the Humboldt University of Berlin[7] and a Minerva Distinguished Visitor[8] at Princeton University. Since January 2018 she has held the Chair of Number Theory as a full professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne in Switzerland after a short stint as tenure-track assistant professor.[3]\n In 2016, Viazovska solved the sphere-packing problem in dimension\u00a08[9][10][11] and, in collaboration with others, in dimension\u00a024.[12][7] Previously, the problem had been solved only for three or fewer dimensions, and the proof of the three-dimensional version (the Kepler conjecture) involved long computer calculations. In contrast, Viazovska's proof for 8 and 24 dimensions is \"stunningly simple\".[7]\n As well as for her work on sphere packing, Viazovska is also known for her research on spherical designs with Bondarenko and Radchenko. With them she proved a conjecture of Korevaar and Meyers on the existence of small designs in arbitrary dimensions. This result was one of the contributions for which her co-author Andriy Bondarenko won the Vasil A. Popov Prize for approximation theory in 2013.[13]\n In 2016, Viazovska received the Salem Prize[14] and, in 2017, the Clay Research Award and the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize for her work on sphere packing and modular forms.[15][16] In December 2017, she was awarded a 2018 New Horizons Prize in Mathematics.[17]\nShe was an invited speaker at the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians.[18] For 2019 she was awarded the Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics[19] and the Fermat Prize.[20] She is one of the 2020 winners of the EMS Prize.[21]  In 2020, she also received the National Latsis Prize awarded by the Latsis Foundation.[22]\n ", "tags": ["1984 births", "Living people", "Ukrainian mathematicians", "Women mathematicians", "University of Bonn alumni", "Geometers", "Number theorists", "Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv alumni", "Humboldt University of Berlin faculty", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne faculty", "CS1 Ukrainian-language sources (uk)", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Ukrainian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Ukrainian mathematician\nMaryna ViazovskaAt Oberwolfach, 2013Born1984 (age\u00a036\u201337)CitizenshipUkrainianAlma\u00a0mater\nTaras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv\nUniversity of Kaiserslautern\nUniversity of Bonn\nKnown\u00a0forSphere-packing problemAwardsSalem Prize (2016)  Clay Research Award (2017)  SASTRA Ramanujan Prize (2017)  European Prize in Combinatorics (2017)New Horizons in Mathematics Prize (2018)  Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics (2019)Fermat Prize (2019)EMS Prize (2020)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutions\nBerlin Mathematical School\nHumboldt University of Berlin\n\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne\nThesisModular Functions and Special Cycles\u00a0(2013)Doctoral advisorsDon Zagier Werner M\u00fcller\nWebsitehttps://tn.epfl.ch/\nMaryna Sergiivna Viazovska (Ukrainian: \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0456\u0457\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0412'\u044f\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430;[1] born 1984)[2] is a Ukrainian mathematician known for her work in sphere packing.
