{"name": "Dorothy Maharam", "content": "Dorothy Maharam Stone (July 1, 1917[1] \u2013 September 27, 2014\n[2])\nwas an American mathematician born in Parkersburg, West Virginia, who made important contributions to measure theory and became the namesake of Maharam's theorem and Maharam algebra.[3]\n Maharam earned her B.S. degree at Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1937 and her Ph.D. in 1940 under Anna Johnson Pell Wheeler from Bryn Mawr College with a dissertation entitled On measure in abstract sets.[4] Part of her thesis was published in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society. Then she went on to a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey,[5] where she first met fellow mathematician Arthur Harold Stone. They married in April 1942.\n Stone and Maharam both lectured at various universities in the US and the United Kingdom and were faculty at the University of Rochester for many years. She was an invited speaker at a measure theory conference at Northern Illinois University in 1980.[6] Their two children, David and Ellen, both became mathematicians as well.\n She retired in 2001. Her husband, Arthur Stone, died August 6, 2000, and her son, David Stone, died August 27, 2014.\n Maharam pioneered the research of finitely additive measures on integers.\nMaharam's theorem about the decomposability of  complete measure spaces plays an important role in the theory of Banach spaces. Maharam published it in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America in 1942.  Another paper of Maharam, in 1947 in the Annals of Mathematics, introduced Maharam algebras, which are complete Boolean algebras with continuous submeasures.\n ", "tags": ["1917 births", "2014 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "20th-century American women scientists", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Institute for Advanced Study people", "Carnegie Mellon University alumni", "Bryn Mawr College alumni", "University of Rochester faculty", "People from Parkersburg, West Virginia", "Mathematicians from West Virginia", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nDorothy Maharam Stone (July 1, 1917[1] \u2013 September 27, 2014\n[2])\nwas an American mathematician born in Parkersburg, West Virginia, who made important contributions to measure theory and became the namesake of Maharam's theorem and Maharam algebra.[3]\n\nLife[edit]\nMaharam earned her B.S. degree at Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1937 and her Ph.D. in 1940 under Anna Johnson Pell Wheeler from Bryn Mawr College with a dissertation entitled On measure in abstract sets.[4] Part of her thesis was published in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society.
