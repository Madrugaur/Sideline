{"name": "Kefeng Liu", "content": "Kefeng Liu (Chinese: \u5218\u514b\u5cf0; born 12 December 1965), is a Chinese-American mathematician who is known for his contributions to geometric analysis, particularly the geometry, topology and analysis of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and Calabi-Yau manifolds. He is a professor of mathematics at University of California, Los Angeles, as well as the Executive Director of the Center of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University. He is best-known for his collaboration with Bong Lian and Shing-Tung Yau in which they establish some enumerative geometry conjectures motivated by mirror symmetry.\n Liu was born in Kaifeng, Henan province, China. In 1985, Liu received his B.A. in mathematics from the Department of Mathematics of Peking University in Beijing. In 1988, Liu obtained his M.A. from the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Beijing.[citation needed] Liu then went to study in the United States, obtaining a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1993 under Shing-Tung Yau.[1]\n From 1993 to 1996, Liu was C.
