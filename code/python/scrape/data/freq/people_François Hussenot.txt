After graduation, he attended two other schools: the Ecole Militaire d'Application de l'A\u00e9ronautique in Versailles, where he obtained his pilot license, and the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d'A\u00e9ronautique (better known as Supa\u00e9ro), which he graduated in 1935 with a degree in aeronautical engineering.\n His career began at the Centre d'Essais de Mat\u00e9riels A\u00e9riens (CEMA) of Villacoublay, an aircraft test center, in 1935. In July of that year, he married Yvonne. In 1936, he was sent to Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, in southern France, to take part in the testing of heavy sea planes. In 1941, he moved to the Centre d'Essais en Vol de Marignane, where he made his early attempts at constructing a flight data recorder. Unlike modern recorders, Hussenot's early models had the particularity of storing the information not on a magnetic band, but on an eight meter long by 88\u00a0mm wide photographic film, scrolling in front of a thin spot of light deviated by a mirror to represent the data.[1][2] The initials HB stood for Hussenot and Beaudouin, the name of an early associate who helped Hussenot in developing the device during World War II. Those flight recorders were also known as \"Hussenographs\".\n In July 1945, Hussenot was appointed as an engineer at the Br\u00e9tigny-sur-Orge flight test center (Centre d'Essais en Vol de Br\u00e9tigny-sur-Orge) as the director of the Methods and Try-Outs service (Service des M\u00e9thodes et Essais). In 1946, with Maurice Cambois and Charles Cabaret, he created the Ecole du Personnel Navigant (E.P.N.) school, which later became the EPNER (Ecole du Personnel Navigant d'Essais et de R\u00e9ception). As of today, the EPNER is one of only six test pilot schools in the world, together with the Empire Test Pilots' School, the United States Air Force Test Pilot School and the United States Naval Test Pilot School, the National Test Pilot School, and the Indian Air Force Test Pilots School.\n In 1947 Hussenot founded the SFIM (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise des Instruments de Mesure) with his associate Marcel Ramolfo, to market his flight data recorder. The SFIM had a successful story of its own, selling many successful data recording devices, before diversifying. The company is today part of the Safran group.\n In 1948, Hussenot became professor at SUPAERO. In the same year, he was appointed Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur, and was awarded the M\u00e9daille de l'A\u00e9ronautique (Medal of Aeronautics) in recognition for his services.\n Fran\u00e7ois Hussenot died in 1951, in a plane crash between Marignane and Mont-de-Marsan.\n ", "tags": ["French aerospace engineers", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni", "Supa\u00e9ro alumni", "Corps de l'armement", "French inventors", "1912 births", "1951 deaths", "Recipients of the Aeronautical Medal", "Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "20th-century inventors", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from January 2018", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Fran\u00e7ois Hussenot (22 March 1912 \u2013 16 May 1951) was a French engineer, credited with the invention of one of the early forms of the flight data recorder.\nHe attended the \u00c9cole polytechnique from 1930 to 1932.
