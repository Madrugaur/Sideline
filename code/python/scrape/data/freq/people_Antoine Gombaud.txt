Later his friends began calling him by that name.[2]\n M\u00e9r\u00e9 was an important Salon theorist. Like many 17th century liberal thinkers, he distrusted both hereditary power and democracy, a stance at odds with his self-bestowed noble title. He believed that questions are best resolved in open discussions among witty, fashionable, intelligent people.\n M\u00e9r\u00e9's most famous essays are L'honn\u00eate homme (The Honest Man) and Discours de la vraie honn\u00eatet\u00e9 (Discourse on True Honesty),[1] but he is far better known for his contribution to probability theory. He was an amateur mathematician who became interested in a problem that dates to medieval times, if not earlier, the problem of the points.
