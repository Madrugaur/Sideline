John Herschel's notation for inverse functions, sin\u22121\u2009x, tan\u22121\u2009x, etc., was published by him in the Philosophical Transactions of London, for the year 1813. He says (p.\u00a010): \"This notation cos.\u22121\u2009e must not be understood to signify 1/cos.\u00a0e, but what is usually written thus, arc\u2009(cos.=e).\" He admits that some authors use cos.m\u2009A for (cos.\u2009A)m, but he justifies his own notation by pointing out that since d2\u2009x, \u03943\u2009x, \u03a32\u2009x mean dd\u2009x, \u0394\u0394\u0394\u2009x, \u03a3\u03a3\u2009x, we ought to write sin.2\u2009x for sin.\u2009sin.\u2009x, log.3\u2009x for log.\u2009log.\u2009log.\u2009x. Just as we write d\u2212n\u2009V=\u222bn\u2009V, we may write similarly sin.\u22121\u2009x=arc\u2009(sin.=x), log.\u22121\u2009x.=cx. Some years later Herschel explained that in 1813 he used fn(x), f\u2212n(x), sin.\u22121\u2009x, etc., \"as he then supposed for the first time. The work of a German Analyst, Burmann, has, however, within these few months come to his knowledge, in which the same is explained at a considerably earlier date. He[Burmann], however, does not seem to have noticed the convenience of applying this idea to the inverse functions tan\u22121, etc., nor does he appear at all aware of the inverse calculus of functions to which it gives rise.\" Herschel adds, \"The symmetry of this notation and above all the new and most extensive views it opens of the nature of analytical operations seem to authorize its universal adoption.\"[a] [\u2026] (xviii+367+1 pages including 1 addenda page) (NB.
