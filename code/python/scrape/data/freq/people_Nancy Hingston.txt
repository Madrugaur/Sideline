She is a professor of mathematics at The College of New Jersey.[1]\n Nancy Hingston's father William Hingston was superintendent of the Central Bucks School District in Pennsylvania; her mother was a high school mathematics and computer science teacher.[2] She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a double major in mathematics and physics.
