{"name": "Neil Arnott", "content": "\n Dr Neil Arnott FRS LLD (15 May 1788\u00a0\u2013 March 1874) was a Scottish physician and inventor. He was the inventor of one of the first forms of the waterbed, the Arnott waterbed. and was awarded the Rumford Medal in 1852 for the construction of the smokeless fire grate, as well as other improvements to ventilation and heating.[1]\n He was born in Arbroath,[2] the son of Alexander Arnott and his wife, Ann MacLean of Borreray. He came from a line of master bakers.[3]\n Neil Arnott was a distinguished graduate of Marischal College, University of Aberdeen (AM, 1805; MD 1814) and subsequently studied in London under Sir Everard Home (1756\u20131832), through whom he obtained, when only eighteen, the appointment of full surgeon to an East Indiaman. After making two voyages to China acting as a surgeon in the service of the British East India Company (1807-9 and 1810\u201311), he settled in London where he practised from 1811\u20131854, and quickly acquired a high reputation. He gave lectures at the Philomathic Institution published as Elements of physics (1827). He was one of the founders of the University of London, 1836. Within a few years he was made physician to the French and Spanish embassies, and in 1837 he became physician extraordinary to the Queen. He was elected to the Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1838.\n He was a strong advocate of scientific, as opposed to purely classical, education; and he manifested interest in natural philosophy by the gift of 2,000 pounds to each of the four universities of Scotland and to the University of London, to promote its study in the experimental and practical form.[4]\n He died in London in 1874 but is buried with his mother in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. The simple obelisk lies in the north-west section of the original cemetery, west of the large Beattie obelisk.\n He was the author of several works on physical science or its applications, the most important being his Elements of Physics (1827), which went through six editions in his lifetime. In 1838 he published a treatise on warming and ventilating, and in 1855, one on the smokeless fireplace.[4]\n Arnott was a strong advocate for a natural view of health and on the causes of various diseases. In his paper \u201cOn the Fevers Which Have Prevailed Edinburgh and Glasgow,\u201d Arnott noted \u201cIt gives remarkable simplicity to all inquiries respecting health, to know that among the things and influences around man on earth, in regard to which he can exercise control, there are only four which he needs to obtain, and two which he needs to avoid, that he may have uninterrupted health for as long as the human constitution is formed to last; in other words, that only by some want or misuse of the requisites, or by the direct agency of the noxious agencies can his health be impaired or his life be shortened.[5]\u201d Arnott believed that the four items that needed to be obtained in order to be healthy were fit air, temperature, aliment, and exercise of the mind and of the body, and that if an individual had access to all four of these items, while avoiding violence and poisons (items that Arnott believed caused disease and therefore were to be avoided), that the individual would have no issues when it came to health throughout their life and would be able to live for as long as the body permits one to live, and that by surrounding oneself with the four essential items, the human bodily makeup would slowly become modified by \u201ckindred circumstances not deemed diseases but called temperaments and varieties, compatible with health and long life.\u201d Arnott also referenced the findings of the report made to the Poor Law Commissioners in his paper Sanitary Inquiry-Scotland, and regarded the contents of this report as facts, making note of the claim that malaria was caused by the exhalation released during putrefaction or decomposition of animal and vegetable substances.\n From his earliest youth, Arnott had an intense love of natural philosophy, and to this added an inventiveness which served him in good stead in his profession. This inventiveness helped him to design the Arnott waterbed in the 19th century that was devised to prevent bedsores in invalids. The bed was composed of a bath of water with a covering of rubber-impregnated canvas, on which lighter bedding was placed. However, Arnott didn't patent his design, and without a patent, anyone was able to construct a bed in this design. The design was later developed into a water-filled chair intended to prevent seasickness. Other inventions include the Arnott ventilator and the Arnott stove.\n Attribution:\n ", "tags": ["1788 births", "1874 deaths", "People from Arbroath", "19th-century Scottish medical doctors", "Alumni of the University of Aberdeen", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Burials at the Dean Cemetery", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia introduction cleanup from March 2017", "All pages needing cleanup", "Articles covered by WikiProject Wikify from March 2017", "All articles covered by WikiProject Wikify", "Use dmy dates from September 2014", "Use British English from December 2012", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Scottish physician and inventor\nThis article's lead section may be too short to adequately summarize its key points.
