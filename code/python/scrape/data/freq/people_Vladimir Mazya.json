He also contributed to the development of the theory of capacities, nonlinear potential theory, the asymptotic and qualitative theory of arbitrary order elliptic equations, the theory of ill-posed problems, the theory of boundary value problems in domains with piecewise smooth boundary.\n Vladimir Maz'ya was born on 31 December 1937[2] in a Jewish family.[12] His father died in December 1941 at the World War II front,[2][12][13] and all four grandparents died during the siege of Leningrad.[2][12] His mother, a state accountant,[14] chose to not remarry and dedicated her life to him:[12] they lived on her meager salary in a 9 square meters room in a big communal apartment, shared with other four families.[12][15] As a secondary school student, he repeatedly won the city's mathematics and physics olympiads[16] and graduated with a gold medal.[17]\n In 1955, at the age of 18, Maz'ya entered the Mathematics and Mechanics Department of Leningrad University.[18] Taking part to the traditional mathematical olympiad of the faculty, he solved the problems for both first year and second year students and, since he did not make this a secret, the other participants did not submit their solutions causing the invalidation of the contest by the jury which therefore did not award the prize.[13] However, he attracted the attention of Solomon Mikhlin who invited him at his home, thus starting their lifelong friendship:[13] and this friendship had a great influence on him, helping him develop his mathematical style more than anyone else. According to Gohberg (1999, p.\u00a02),[19] in the years to come, \"Maz'ya was never a formal student of Mikhlin, but Mikhlin was more than a teacher for him. Maz\u2019ya had found the topics of his dissertations by himself, while Mikhlin taught him mathematical ethics and rules of writing, referring and reviewing\".[20]\n More details on the life of Vladimir Maz'ya, from his birth to the year 1968, can be found in his autobiography (Maz'ya 2014).\n Maz'ya graduated from Leningrad University in 1960.[1][21] The same year he gave two talks at Smirnov's seminar:[22] their contents were published as a short report in the Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences[23][24] and later evolved in his \"kandidat nauk\" thesis, \"Classes of sets and embedding theorems for function spaces\",[25] which was defended in 1962.[26] In 1965 he earned the Doktor nauk degree, again from Leningrad University, defending the dissertation \"Dirichlet and Neumann problems in Domains with irregular boundaries\", when he was only 27.[27] Neither the first nor his second thesis were written under the guidance of an advisor: Vladimir Maz'ya never had a formal scientific adviser, choosing the research problems he worked to by himself.[28]\n From 1960 up to 1986, he worked as a \"research fellow\"[29] at the Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics of Leningrad University (RIMM), being promoted from junior to senior research fellow in 1965.[30] From 1968 to 1978 he taught at the Leningrad Shipbuilding Institute\u00a0[ru], where he was awarded the title of \"professor\" in 1976.[31] From 1986 to 1990 he worked to the Leningrad Section of the Blagonravov Research Institute of Mechanical Engineering\u00a0[ru] of the USSR Academy of Sciences,[32] where he created and directed the Laboratory of Mathematical Models in Mechanics and the Consulting Center in Mathematics for Engineers.[33]\n In 1978 he married Tatyana Shaposhnikova, a former doctoral student of Solomon Mikhlin, and they have a son, Michael:[34] In 1990, they left the URSS for Sweden, where Prof. Maz'ya obtained the Swedish citizenship and started to work at Link\u00f6ping University.[35]\n Currently, he is honorary Senior Fellow of Liverpool University and Professor Emeritus at Link\u00f6ping University: he is also member of the editorial board of several mathematical journals.[36]\n In 1962 Maz'ya was awarded the \"Young Mathematician\" prize by the Leningrad Mathematical Society, for his results on Sobolev spaces:[25] he was the first winner of the prize.[23] In 1990 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Rostock University.[37] In 1999, Maz'ya received the Humboldt Prize.[37][38] He was elected member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2000,[39] and of the Swedish Academy of Science in 2002.[37] In March 2003, he, jointly with Tatyana Shaposhnikova, was awarded the Verdaguer Prize by the French Academy of Sciences.[40] On 31 August 2004 he was awarded the Celsius Gold Medal, the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala's top award, \"for his outstanding research on partial differential equations and hydrodynamics\".[41] He was awarded the Senior Whitehead Prize by the London Mathematical Society on 20 November 2009.[42] In 2012 he was elected fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[43] On 30 October 2013 he was elected foreign member of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences.[44]\n Starting from 1993, several conferences have been held to honor him: the first one, held in that year at the University of Kyoto, was a conference on Sobolev spaces.[45] On the occasion of his 60th birthday in 1998, two international conferences were held in his honor: the one at the University of Rostock was on Sobolev spaces,[45][46] while the other, at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris,[45][47] was on the boundary element method. He was invited speaker at the International Mathematical Congress held in Beijing in 2002:[37] his talk is an exposition on his work on Wiener\u2013type criteria for higher order elliptic equations. Other two conferences were held on the occasion of his 70th birthday: \"Analysis, PDEs and Applications on the occasion of the 70th birthday of Vladimir Maz'ya\" was held in Rome,[48] while the \"Nordic \u2013 Russian Symposium in honour of Vladimir Maz'ya on the occasion of his 70th birthday\" was held in Stockholm.[49] On the same occasion, also a volume of the Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics was dedicated to him.[50] On the occasion of his 80th birthday, a \"Workshop on Sobolev Spaces and Partial Differential Equations\" was held on 17\u201318 May 2018 was held at the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei to honor him.[51] On the 26\u201331 May 2019, the international conference \"Harmonic Analysis and PDE\" was held in his honor at the Holon Institute of Technology.[52] On the December 2020, He was elected member of the EU Academy of Sciences in the Class of Mathematical Sciences.[53]\n Because of Maz\u2019ya\u2019s ability to give complete solutions to problems which are generally considered as unsolvable, Fichera once compared Maz\u2019ya with Santa Rita, the 14th century Italian nun who is the Patron Saint of Impossible Causes. Maz'ya authored/coauthored more than 500 publications, including 20 research monographs. Several survey articles describing his work can be found in the book (Rossmann, Tak\u00e1\u010d & Wildenhain 1999a), and also the paper by Dorina and Marius Mitrea (2008) describes extensively his research achievements, so these references are the main ones in this section: in particular, the classification of the research work of Vladimir Maz'ya is the one proposed by the authors of these two references.\n In one of his early papers, Maz'ya (1961) considers the Dirichlet problem for the following linear elliptic equation:[54][55]\n where \n He proves the following a priori estimate\n for the weak solution u of equation 1, where K is a constant depending on n, s, r \u03ba and other parameters but not depending on the moduli of continuity of the coefficients.
