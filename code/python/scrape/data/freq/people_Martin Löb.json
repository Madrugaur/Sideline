{"name": "Martin L\u00f6b", "content": "Martin Hugo L\u00f6b (German: [l\u00f8\u02d0p]; 31 March 1921 \u2013 21 August 2006) was a German mathematician.  He settled in the United Kingdom after the Second World War and specialised in mathematical logic.  He moved to the Netherlands in the 1970s, where he remained in retirement.  He is perhaps best known for having formulated L\u00f6b's theorem in 1955.\n L\u00f6b grew up in Berlin, but escaped from the Third Reich, arriving in the UK just before the outbreak of the Second World War.  As an enemy alien, he was deported on the Dunera to an internment camp at Hay in Australia in 1940, where the 19-year-old L\u00f6b was taught mathematics by other internees.  His teacher, Felix Behrend, was later a professor at Melbourne University.\n L\u00f6b was allowed to return to the UK in 1943, and he studied at the University of London after the War. After graduating, he became a research student with Reuben Goodstein at the  University of Leicester. He completed his PhD and became an assistant lecturer at the University of Leeds in 1951, where he was to remain for 20 years, becoming a Reader and ultimately Professor of Mathematical Logic from 1967 to 1970. He developed the mathematical logic group at Leeds, making it one of the leading centres in the UK. L\u00f6b did research on proof theory, modal logic and computability theory. He formulated L\u00f6b's theorem in 1955, as a formal version of L\u00f6b's paradox, that statements that assert their own provability must be true (similar to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem).\n L\u00f6b's wife, Caroline, was Dutch.  They had two daughters together.  L\u00f6b moved to become a professor at the University of Amsterdam in the early 1970s.  He remained at the University of Amsterdam until he retired.  He then moved to Annen, where he later died.\n ", "tags": ["1921 births", "2006 deaths", "20th-century German mathematicians", "German logicians", "Alumni of the University of London", "Alumni of the University of Leicester", "Academics of the University of Leeds", "University of Amsterdam faculty", "Scientists from Berlin", "German emigrants to the United Kingdom", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Martin Hugo L\u00f6bBorn(1921-03-31)March 31, 1921BerlinDiedAugust 21, 2006(2006-08-21) (aged\u00a085)Annen, NetherlandsAlma\u00a0materUniversity of LondonKnown\u00a0forL\u00f6b's theoremSpouse(s)CarolineChildrenMaryke, StefaniScientific careerThesisA Methodological Characterization of Constructive Mathematics[1]\u00a0(1953)Doctoral advisorReuben Louis GoodsteinDoctoral studentsJohan van Benthem\n\nMartin Hugo L\u00f6b (German: [l\u00f8\u02d0p]; 31 March 1921 \u2013 21 August 2006) was a German mathematician.
