{"name": "Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis", "content": "Constantinos A. Doxiadis[a] (also Konstantinos; 14 May 1913 \u2013 28 June 1975), often cited as C. A. Doxiadis, was a Greek architect and town planner. He was known as the lead architect of Islamabad, the new capital of Pakistan in the 1960s, and later as the father of Ekistics, which concerns the science of human settlements.[2]\n Doxiadis is the father of 'Ekistics', which concerns the science of human settlements, including regional, city, community planning and dwelling design.[2] The term was coined by Doxiadis in 1942 and a major incentive for the development of the science is the emergence of increasingly large and complex settlements, tending to regional conurbations and even to a worldwide city. However, ekistics attempts to encompass all scales of human habitation and seeks to learn from the archaeological and historical record by looking not only at great cities, but, as much as possible, at the total settlement pattern.\n Doxiadis also coined the term 'entopia', coming from the Greek word \u03ad\u03bd (\u201cin\u201d) and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (\u201cplace\u201d). He quoted \"What human beings need is not utopia ('no place') but entopia ('in place') a real city which they can build, a place which satisfies the dreamer and is acceptable to the scientist, a place where the projections of the artist and the builder merge.\" .\n In the 1960s and 1970s, urban planner and architect Constantinos Doxiadis authored books, studies, and reports including those regarding the growth potential of the Great Lakes Megalopolis.[3]  At the peak of his popularity, in the 1960s, he addressed the US Congress on the future of American cities, his portrait illustrated the front cover of Time Magazine, his company Doxiadis Associates was implementing large projects in housing, urban and regional development in more than 40 countries, his Computer Centre (UNIVAC-DACC) was at the cutting edge of the computer technology of his time and at his annual \"Delos Symposium\" the World Society of Ekistics attracted the worlds foremost thinkers and experts.\n In Greece, he faced persistent suspicion and opposition and his recommendations were largely ignored. Having won two large contracts (National Regional Plan for Greece and Master Plan for Athens) from the Greek Junta he was criticised by competitors, after its fall in 1974, portrayed as a friend of the colonels. His visions for Athens airport to be constructed on the adjacent island of Makronissos, where political prisoners were held, together with a bridge, a rail link and a port at Lavrion were never realised.[citation needed]\n His influence had already diminished at his death in 1975, as he was unable to speak for the last two years of his life, a victim of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).[4] His company Doxiadis Associates changed owners several times after his death, the heir to his computer company remained but without any links to planning or ekistics. The Delos Symposium was discontinued, and the World Society of Ekistics is today an obscure organisation.[citation needed]\n Works about Doxiadis have appeared in the Museum of Brisbane, Milani Gallery, Brisbane and feature in the To Speak of Cities exhibition at the University of Queensland Art Museum.[5][6]\n One of his best-known town planning works is Islamabad. Designed as a new city it was fully realised, unlike many of his other proposals in already existing cities, where shifting political and economic forces did not allow full implementation of his plans. The plan for Islamabad, separates cars and people, allows easy and affordable access to public transport and utilities and permits low cost gradual expansion and growth without losing the human scale of his \"communities\".\n \nDoxiadis's work in Riyadh and elsewhere represented what one anthropologist has called \"containment urbanism,\" that is to say policies aimed at integrating rural masses migrating to cities and thus prevent the emergence of subversive political movements. In Riyadh, Doxiadis reoriented the city on a southwest-northeast axis, rendering \"the planned city...similar to an immense mosque facing Mecca.\" [7] His work was also part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics.[8] His awards and decorations are as follows:[citation needed]\n ", "tags": ["Greek urban planners", "1913 births", "1975 deaths", "Urban theorists", "Knights of the National Order of the Cedar", "People from Asenovgrad", "National Technical University of Athens alumni", "Technical University of Berlin alumni", "Deaths from motor neuron disease", "20th-century Greek architects", "Bulgarian people of Greek descent", "Olympic competitors in art competitions", "Recipients of the War Cross (Greece)", "Recipients of the Order of the Phoenix (Greece)", "Greek Resistance members", "Articles containing Greek-language text", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from July 2008", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with hCards", "No local image but image on Wikidata", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from October 2009", "Articles with unsourced statements from November 2020", "CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Greek architect\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
