He was awarded a Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Z\u00fcrich in 1994.\n \nZelmanov was born into a Jewish family in Khabarovsk, Soviet Union (now in Russia). He entered Novosibirsk State University in 1972, when he was 17 years old.[2] He obtained a doctoral degree at Novosibirsk State University in 1980, and a higher degree at Leningrad State University in 1985. He had a position in Novosibirsk until 1987, when he left the Soviet Union. In 1990 he moved to the United States, becoming a professor at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.
