{"name": "Sofia Danova", "content": "Sofia Danova (n\u00e9e Simeonova; born 1879 in Veliko Tarnovo; died 1946) was a Bulgarian philanthropist, educator and publisher. She was the first Bulgarian woman to graduate in mathematics. \n Danova's father had been a Russian feldsher in the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878) who settled in Bulgaria when he met his future wife. Sofia had a sister Olya.[1] She graduated from the Metropolitan Clement Girls' High School in Veliko Tarnovo. She then went to Russia to attend the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology from where she obtained a degree in mathematics. Between 1904 and 1907, she taught mathematics at the Plovdiv Girls' Gymnasium. She married Gruyo Danov, a son of Hristo G. Danov, a publisher, in 1907.[1] She also was active in the family publishing house after her father-in-law's death in 1911, along with her husband and brother-in-law. They published around 2,400 books by 1947 when the publishing house was dissolved.[2]\n She died in 1946.[1]\n In 1936, Sofia headed a women's charitable foundation to support the education of poor students. The foundation, established in 1895, aimed at the economic independence of girls by training them in a vocation. A range of subjects were taught, including embroidery, tailoring, art and draughtsmanship. In 1910, the school library was set up with books donated by Hristo Danov. A fund in Sofia's name was established as well, which by 1946 had a capital of 31,690 lev.
