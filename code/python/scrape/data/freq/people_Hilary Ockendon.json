{"name": "Hilary Ockendon", "content": "Hilary Ockendon is a British mathematician who worked at the University of Oxford until retirement in 2008.  Her research focuses on applications of mathematics with a particular interest in continuum models for industrial problems.  She is an emeritus fellow of Somerville College, Oxford, the former president of the European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry, and the author of multiple books on fluid dynamics.  She is an expert on problems in fluid dynamics, such as the reduction of sloshing in coffee cups.[2]\n Born in Derby in 1941 Ockendon attended Derby High School for Girls from 1946 to 1959.   In 1959 she went up to read Mathematics at St Hilda\u2019s College,Oxford.  After graduating her first job was at GCHQ but after 2 years she obtained a research/teaching post at Somerville College and returned to Oxford.
