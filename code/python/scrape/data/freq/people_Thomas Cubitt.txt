{"name": "Thomas Cubitt", "content": "\n Thomas Cubitt (25 February 1788 \u2013 20 December 1855) was a British master builder, notable for his employment in developing many of the historic streets and squares of London, especially in Belgravia, Pimlico[a] and Bloomsbury.[b]\n The son of a Norfolk carpenter, he journeyed to India as ship's carpenter from which he earned sufficient funds to start his own building firm in 1810 on Gray's Inn Road, London where he was one of the first builders to have a 'modern' system of employing all the trades under his own management.[1]\n Cubitt's first major building was the London Institution in Finsbury Circus, built in 1815.[2] After this he worked primarily on speculative housing at Camden Town, Islington, and especially at Highbury Park, Stoke Newington (now part of Hackney).[3]\n His development of areas of Bloomsbury, including Gordon Square and Tavistock Square, began in 1820, for a group of landowners including the Duke of Bedford.[4]\n He was commissioned in 1824 by Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, to create a great swathe of building in Belgravia centred on Belgrave Square and Pimlico, in what was to become his greatest achievement in London.[5] Notable amongst this development are the north and west sides of Eaton Square, which exemplify Cubitt's style of building and design.[5]\n After Cubitt's workshops in Thames Bank were destroyed by fire, he remarked \"Tell the men they shall be at work within a week, and I will subscribe \u00a3600 towards buying them new tools.\"[6]\n Cubitt was also responsible for the east front of Buckingham Palace.[7] He also built and personally funded nearly a kilometre of the Thames Embankment.[8] He was employed in the large development of Kemp Town in Brighton, and Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, completed in 1851.[7] Cubitt's public works included the provision of public parks, including being an organiser of the Battersea Park Scheme.[9]\n In 1827 he withdrew from the management of his Gray's Inn Road concern leaving this to his brother William Cubitt; the firm of Cubitts still carried out the work of Thomas Cubitt and the change robbed neither partner of the credit for their work.[7]\n Cubitt had two brothers, the contractor and politician William and the civil engineer Lewis who designed many houses built by Thomas.\n[10]\n His developer-architect son by his wife Mary Anne Warner, George, who was created Baron Ashcombe in 1892, was a great-great-grandfather of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.\n[11][12]\n Cubitt died in 1855[7] and was taken from Dorking for burial at West Norwood Cemetery on 27 December 1855.[13]\n After his death, Queen Victoria said, \"In his sphere of life, with the immense business he had in hand, he is a real national loss. A better, kindhearted or more simple, unassuming man never breathed.\"[14]\n Another statue of Cubitt can be seen in Dorking, opposite the Dorking Halls, as he was favoured there for his architecture on his Denbies estate.[15]\n In 1883 the business was acquired by Holland & Hannen, a leading competitor, which combination became known as Holland & Hannen and Cubitts, later Holland, Hannen & Cubitts.[16]\n Restaurants, pubs and other places have been named in his honour.[17]\n ", "tags": ["1788 births", "1855 deaths", "Burials at West Norwood Cemetery", "English carpenters", "British builders", "Architects from Norfolk", "Italianate architecture in the United Kingdom", "People from Broadland (district)", "People from Dorking", "Cubitt family", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the ODNB", "Pages using cite ODNB with id parameter", "EngvarB from November 2017", "Use dmy dates from November 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nFor the British general, see Thomas Cubitt (British Army officer).\nThomas CubittBorn25 February 1788Buxton, Norfolk, EnglandDied20 December 1855 (aged 67)Denbies, Surrey, England.NationalityBritishOccupationArchitectPracticeCubittsBuildingsThe London InstitutionBuckingham PalaceOsborne HouseProjectsBelgrave SquareLowndes SquareChesham PlaceGordon SquareTavistock SquareEccleston SquareDesignEaton SquareBattersea Park\n\nThomas Cubitt (25 February 1788 \u2013 20 December 1855) was a British master builder, notable for his employment in developing many of the historic streets and squares of London, especially in Belgravia, Pimlico[a] and Bloomsbury.[b]\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n2 Work\n3 Family\n4 Legacy\n5 References and footnotes\n\n\nBackground[edit]\nThe son of a Norfolk carpenter, he journeyed to India as ship's carpenter from which he earned sufficient funds to start his own building firm in 1810 on Gray's Inn Road, London where he was one of the first builders to have a 'modern' system of employing all the trades under his own management.[1]\n\nWork[edit]\n Statue of Thomas Cubitt by William Fawke, 1995.
