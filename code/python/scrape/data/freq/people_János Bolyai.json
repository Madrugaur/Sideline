{"name": "J\u00e1nos Bolyai", "content": "\n J\u00e1nos Bolyai (Hungarian:\u00a0[\u02c8ja\u02d0no\u0283 \u02c8bo\u02d0j\u0252i]; 15 December 1802 \u2013 27 January 1860) or Johann Bolyai,[2] was a Hungarian mathematician, who developed absolute geometry\u2014a geometry that includes both Euclidean geometry and hyperbolic geometry. The discovery of a consistent alternative geometry that might correspond to the structure of the universe helped to free mathematicians to study abstract concepts irrespective of any possible connection with the physical world.[3]\n Bolyai was born in the Hungarian town of Kolozsv\u00e1r, Grand Principality of Transylvania (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania), the son of Zsuzsanna Benk\u0151 and the well-known mathematician Farkas Bolyai.\n By the age of 13, he had mastered calculus and other forms of analytical mechanics, receiving instruction from his father. He studied at the Imperial and Royal Military Academy (TherMilAk) in Vienna from 1818 to 1822.\n Bolyai became so obsessed with Euclid's parallel postulate that his father, who had pursued the same subject for many years, wrote to him in 1820: \"You must not attempt this approach to parallels. I know this way to the very end. I have traversed this bottomless night, which extinguished all light and joy in my life. I entreat you, leave the science of parallels alone...Learn from my example.\"[4]\n J\u00e1nos, however, persisted in his quest and eventually came to the conclusion that the postulate is independent of the other axioms of geometry and that different consistent geometries can be constructed on its negation. In 1823, he wrote to his father: \"I have discovered such wonderful things that I was amazed...out of nothing I have created a strange new universe.\"[4][5] Between 1820 and 1823 he had prepared a treatise on parallel lines that he called absolute geometry. Bolyai's work was published in 1832 as an appendix to a mathematics textbook by his father.\n Carl Friedrich Gauss, on reading the Appendix, wrote to a friend saying \"I regard this young geometer Bolyai as a genius of the first order.\"[6] To Bolyai, however, Gauss wrote: \"To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work...coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years.\"[4][6][5] In 1848 Bolyai learned that Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky had published a similar piece of work in 1829. Though Lobachevsky published his work a few years earlier than Bolyai, it contained only hyperbolic geometry. Working independently, Bolyai and Lobachevsky pioneered the investigation of non-Euclidean geometry.\n In addition to his work in geometry, Bolyai developed a rigorous geometric concept of complex numbers as ordered pairs of real numbers. Although he never published more than the 24 pages of the Appendix, he left more than 20,000 pages of mathematical manuscripts when he died. These can now be found in the Teleki-Bolyai Library in Marosv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely (today T\u00e2rgu Mure\u015f), where Bolyai died.\n He was an accomplished linguist speaking several foreign languages: German, Latin, French, Italian, Romanian.[7] He learned the violin and performed in Vienna.\n It is related of him that he was challenged by thirteen officers of his garrison, a thing not unlikely to happen considering how differently he thought from everyone else. He fought them all in succession\u2014making it his only condition that he should be allowed to play on his violin for an interval between meeting each opponent. He disarmed or wounded all his antagonists. It can be easily imagined that a temperament such as his was not one congenial to his military superiors. He was retired in 1833.[8] No original portrait of Bolyai survives. An unauthentic picture appears in some encyclopedias and on a Hungarian postage stamp.[1]\n The Babe\u015f-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, that was established in 1959, bears his name, as does the crater Bolyai on the Moon[9] and the J\u00e1nos Bolyai Mathematical Institute  at the University of Szeged. Furthermore, 1441 Bolyai, a minor planet discovered in 1937, is named after him; and many[quantify] primary and secondary schools in the Carpathian Basin bear his name, e.g. Bolyai J\u00e1nos M\u0171szaki Szakk\u00f6z\u00e9piskola in Budapest, Bolyai J\u00e1nos Gyakorl\u00f3 \u00c1ltal\u00e1nos Iskola \u00e9s Gimn\u00e1zium in Szombathely, Bolyai J\u00e1nos \u00c1ltal\u00e1nos Iskola in Debrecen, etc.[citation needed]  A street in Budapest, Hungary and another two in Kolozsv\u00e1r [10] and Temesv\u00e1r (now Cluj-Napoca and Timi\u0219oara), Romania are also named after him. The professional society of Hungarian mathematicians also bears his name. Bolyai is a minor character in the 1969 science-fiction/fantasy story \"Operation Changeling\", where his unique abilities allow the protagonists to navigate the non-Euclidean geometry of Hell.\n There is also a mathematical award given out every five years named the Bolyai Prize.\n His grave lies in the Lutheran Cemetery in T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, Romania.[11]\n ", "tags": ["1802 births", "1860 deaths", "19th-century mathematicians", "19th-century Hungarian people", "Hungarian mathematicians", "Geometers", "Scientists from Cluj-Napoca", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from April 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from October 2013", "Articles with Romanian-language sources (ro)", "Commons link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian mathematician\n\"Bolyai\" redirects here.
