After finishing high school Bill left Michigan to major in Mathematics at Harvard College. LeMessurier graduated with an AB in Mathematics in 1947, then went to Harvard Graduate School of Design. He would later transfer over to  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he earned his Master's Degree in building engineering and construction in 1953.[1][2]\n While at MIT, LeMessurier worked for Albert Goldberg an established Boston structural engineer, eventually he would become a partner and the firm was renamed Goldberg-LeMessurier Associates.  In April 1961, the two separated and Bill launched his firm LeMessurier Consultants.[3]\n LeMessurier was responsible for the structural engineering on a large number of prominent buildings, including Boston City Hall, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the Singapore Treasury Building, and the Dallas Main Center.\n LeMessurier is perhaps best known for a structural controversy. LeMessurier re-assessed his calculations on the Citicorp headquarters tower in New York City in 1978, after the building had already been finished, and found that the building was more vulnerable than originally thought (in part due to cost-saving changes made to the original plan by the contractor). This triggered a hurried, clandestine retrofit which was described in a celebrated article in The New Yorker. The article, titled \"The Fifty-Nine-Story Crisis,\"[4]  is now used as an ethical case-study.[5]\n He was awarded the AIA Allied Professions Medal in 1968, elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1978, elected an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects in 1988, and elected an honorary member of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in 1989.[3] In 2004, he was elevated to National Honor Member of Chi Epsilon, the national civil engineering honor society.\n LeMessurier died in Casco, Maine on June 14, 2007 as a result of complications after surgery he underwent on June 1 after a fall the day before.[6]\n ", "tags": ["1926 births", "2007 deaths", "American structural engineers", "People from Casco, Maine", "People from Pontiac, Michigan", "Harvard College alumni", "Harvard Graduate School of Design alumni", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Science alumni", "20th-century American engineers", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "William LeMessurierBornJune 12, 1926Pontiac, MichiganDiedJune 14, 2007Casco, MaineNationalityAmericanEducationHarvard College (AB 1947); Harvard Graduate School of Design; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (SM 1953)OccupationStructural engineer, Architect, professorKnown\u00a0forStructural Engineering\nWilliam \"Bill\" James LeMessurier, Jr. (/l\u0259\u02c8m\u025b\u0292\u0259r/; June 12, 1926\u00a0\u2013 June 14, 2007) was a prominent American structural engineer.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Controversy\n4 Awards\n5 Death\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nBorn in Pontiac, Michigan, he was the youngest of four children of Bertha (Sherman) and William James LeMessurier Sr., owners of a dry cleaning business.
