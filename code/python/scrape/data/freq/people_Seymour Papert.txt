{"name": "Seymour Papert", "content": "\n Seymour Aubrey Papert (/\u02c8p\u00e6p\u0259rt/; 29 February 1928 \u2013 31 July 2016) was a South African-born American mathematician, computer scientist, and educator, who spent most of his career teaching and researching at MIT.[2][3][4] He was one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence, and of the constructionist movement in education.[5] He was co-inventor, with Wally Feurzeig and Cynthia Solomon, of the Logo programming language.[2][6][7][8][9]\n Born to a Jewish family,[10] Papert attended the University of the Witwatersrand, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 1949 followed by a PhD in mathematics in 1952.[1][11] He then went on to receive a second doctorate,[2] also in mathematics, at the University of Cambridge (1959),[12] supervised by Frank Smithies.[13]\n Papert worked as a researcher in a variety of places, including St. John's College, Cambridge, the Henri Poincar\u00e9 Institute at the University of Paris, the University of Geneva, and the National Physical Laboratory in London before becoming a research associate at MIT in 1963.[13] He held this position until 1967, when he became professor of applied math and was made co-director of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by its founding director Professor Marvin Minsky, until 1981; he also served as Cecil and Ida Green professor of education at MIT from 1974 to 1981.[13]\n Papert worked on learning theories, and was known for focusing on the impact of new technologies on learning in general, and in schools as learning organizations in particular.\n At MIT, Papert went on to create the Epistemology and Learning Research Group at the MIT Architecture Machine Group which later became the MIT Media Lab.[14] Here, he was the developer of a theory on learning called constructionism, built upon the work of Jean Piaget in constructivist learning theories. Papert had worked with Piaget at the University of Geneva from 1958 to 1963[15] and was one of Piaget's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s; Piaget himself once said that \"no one understands my ideas as well as Papert\".[16] Papert has rethought how schools should work, based on these theories of learning.\n Papert used Piaget's work in his development of the Logo programming language while at MIT. He created Logo as a tool to improve the way children think and solve problems. A small mobile robot called the \"Logo Turtle\" was developed, and children were shown how to use it to solve simple problems in an environment of play. A main purpose of the Logo Foundation research group is to strengthen the ability to learn knowledge.[17] Papert insisted a simple language or program that children can learn\u2014like Logo\u2014can also have advanced functionality for expert users.[2]\n As part of his work with technology, Papert has been a proponent of the Knowledge Machine. He was one of the principals for the One Laptop Per Child initiative to manufacture and distribute The Children's Machine in developing nations.\n Papert also collaborated with the construction toy manufacturer Lego on their Logo-programmable Lego Mindstorms robotics kits,[18] which were named after his groundbreaking 1980 book.[4]\n A curated archive of Papert's articles, speeches, and interviews may be found at The Daily Papert.\n Papert became a political activist early in his life. Janet Levine, a neighbour of the family in South Africa, says \"My father said that he did not know why someone as talented as Seymour would throw his life away for the 'Schvartzes\u2019 (a derogatory Yiddish expression for black people).\"[10] He subsequently chose self exile.[10] He was a leading figure in the revolutionary socialist circle around Socialist Review while living in London in the 1950s.[19] Papert was also a prominent activist against South African apartheid policies during his university education.[4]\n Papert was married to Dona Strauss, and later to Androula Christofides Henriques .[4]\n Papert's third wife was MIT professor Sherry Turkle, and together they wrote the influential paper \"Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete\".[20]\n In his final 24 years, Papert was married to Suzanne Massie, who is a Russian scholar and author of Pavlovsk: The Life of a Russian Palace and Land of the Firebird.[4][21]\n Papert (then aged 78), received a serious brain injury when struck by a motor scooter[4] on 5 December 2006 while crossing the street with colleague Uri Wilensky when they were both attending the 17th International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (ICMI) Study conference in Hanoi, Vietnam.[22] He underwent emergency surgery to remove a blood clot at the French Hospital of Hanoi before being transferred in a complex operation by Swiss Air Ambulance (REGA) Bombardier Challenger Jet to Boston, Massachusetts.[citation needed] He was moved to a hospital closer to his home in January 2007, but then developed sepsis which damaged a heart valve, which was later replaced. By 2008 he had returned home, could think and communicate clearly and walk \"almost unaided\", but still had \"some complicated speech problems\" and was in receipt of extensive rehabilitation support.[23] His rehabilitation team used some of the very principles of experiential, hands-on learning that he had pioneered.[24]\n Papert died at his home in Blue Hill, Maine, on 31 July 2016.[4]\n Papert's work has been used by other researchers in the fields of education and computer science. He influenced the work of Uri Wilensky in the design of NetLogo and collaborated with him on the study of knowledge restructurations, as well as the work of Andrea diSessa and the development of \"dynaturtles\". In 1981, Papert along with several others in the Logo group at MIT, started Logo Computer Systems Inc. (LCSI), of which he was Board Chair for over 20 years. Working with LCSI, Papert designed a number of award-winning programs, including LogoWriter[25] and Lego/Logo (marketed as Lego Mindstorms).  He also influenced the research of Idit Harel Caperton, coauthoring articles and the book Constructionism, and chairing the advisory board of the company MaMaMedia. He also influenced Alan Kay and the Dynabook concept, and worked with Kay on various projects.\n Papert won a Guggenheim fellowship in 1980, a Marconi International fellowship in 1981,[26] the Software Publishers Association Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994, and the Smithsonian Award from Computerworld in 1997.[27] Papert has been called by Marvin Minsky \"the greatest living mathematics educator\".[28]\n MIT President L. Rafael Reif summarized Papert's lifetime of accomplishments: \"With a mind of extraordinary range and creativity, Seymour Papert helped revolutionize at least three fields, from the study of how children make sense of the world, to the development of artificial intelligence, to the rich intersection of technology and learning. The stamp he left on MIT is profound. Today, as MIT continues to expand its reach and deepen its work in digital learning, I am particularly grateful for Seymour's groundbreaking vision, and we hope to build on his ideas to open doors to learners of all ages, around the world.\"[4][29][30][31]\n In 2016 Papert's Alma Mater, University of Witwatersrand, awarded him the degree of \"Doctor of Science in Engineering, honoris causa\"  [2] [3]\n ", "tags": ["1928 births", "2016 deaths", "Artificial intelligence researchers", "Cognitive psychologists", "Computer science educators", "History of artificial intelligence", "Lisp (programming language) people", "Mathematics educators", "People with traumatic brain injuries", "Programming language designers", "Socialist Workers Party (UK) members", "South African computer scientists", "South African educational theorists", "South African mathematicians", "South African Jews", "American Jews", "American people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent", "University of Geneva alumni", "Jewish South African anti-apartheid activists", "MIT Media Lab people", "20th-century South African mathematicians", "21st-century South African mathematicians", "Articles with Curlie links", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Use dmy dates from April 2020", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from November 2019", "Commons link from Wikidata", "Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nSeymour PapertPapert in May 2006BornSeymour Aubrey Papert(1928-02-29)29 February 1928Pretoria, South AfricaDiedJuly 31, 2016(2016-07-31) (aged\u00a088)Blue Hill, Maine, USCitizenshipUSAlma\u00a0mater\nUniversity of the Witwatersrand (BA, PhD)[1]\nUniversity of Cambridge (PhD)\nKnown\u00a0for\nPerceptrons\nArtificial intelligence\nLogo programming language\nOne Laptop per Child\nPapert's principle\nSpouse(s)\nDona Strauss\nAndroula Henriques\nSherry Turkle\nSuzanne Massie\nScientific careerFieldsCognitive scienceEducationMathematicsComputer scienceInstitutions\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nUniversity of Geneva\nUniversity of Paris\nNational Physical Laboratory\nTheses\nSequential Convergence in Lattices with Special Reference To Modular and Subgroup Lattices\u00a0(1952)\nThe Lattices of Logic and Topology\u00a0(1960)\nDoctoral advisorFrank SmithiesDoctoral students\nIdit Harel Caperton[1]\nCarl Hewitt[1]\nMitchel Resnick[1]\nDavid Williamson Shaffer[1]\nGerald Jay Sussman[1]\nTerry Winograd[1]\n\nWebsitepapert.org\nSeymour Aubrey Papert (/\u02c8p\u00e6p\u0259rt/;
