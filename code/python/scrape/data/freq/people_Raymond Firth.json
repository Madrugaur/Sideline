{"name": "Raymond Firth", "content": "\n Sir Raymond William Firth CNZM FBA (25 March 1901 \u2013 22 February 2002) was an ethnologist from New Zealand. As a result of Firth's ethnographic work, actual behaviour of societies (social organization) is separated from the idealized rules of behaviour within the particular society (social structure). He was a long serving Professor of Anthropology at London School of Economics, and is considered to have singlehandedly created a form of British economic anthropology.[1]\n Firth was born to Wesley and Marie Firth in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1901. He was educated at Auckland Grammar School, and then at Auckland University College, where he graduated in economics in 1921.[2] He took his economics MA there in 1922 with a 'fieldwork' based research thesis on the Kauri Gum digging industry,[3] then a diploma in social science in 1923.[4] In 1924 he began his doctoral research at the London School of Economics. Originally intending to complete a thesis in economics, a chance meeting with the eminent social anthropologist Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski led to him to alter his field of study to 'blending economic and anthropological theory with Pacific ethnography'.[2] It was possibly during this period in England that he worked as research assistant to Sir James G Frazer, author of The Golden Bough.[5] Firth's doctoral thesis was published in 1929 as Primitive Economics of the New Zealand M\u0101ori.\n After receiving his PhD in 1927 Firth returned to the southern hemisphere to take up a position at the University of Sydney, although he did not start teaching immediately as a research opportunity presented itself. In 1928 he first visited Tikopia, the southernmost of the Solomon Islands, to study the untouched Polynesian society there, resistant to outside influences and still with its pagan religion and undeveloped economy.[2] This was the beginning of a long relationship with the 1200 people of the remote four-mile long island, and resulted in ten books and numerous articles written over many years. The first of these, We the Tikopia: A Sociological Study of Kinship in Primitive Polynesia was published in 1936 and seventy years on is still used as a basis for many university courses about Oceania.[6]\n In 1930 he started teaching at the University of Sydney. On the departure for Chicago of Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Firth succeeded him as acting Professor. He also took over from Radcliffe-Brown as acting editor of the journal Oceania, and as acting director of the Anthropology Research Committee of the Australian National Research Committee.\n After 18 months he returned to the London School of Economics in 1933 to take up a lectureship, and was appointed Reader in 1935. Together with his wife Rosemary Firth, also to become a distinguished anthropologist, he undertook fieldwork in Kelantan and Terengganu in Malaya in 1939\u20131940.[7] During the Second World War Firth worked for British naval intelligence, primarily writing and editing the four volumes of the Naval Intelligence Division Geographical Handbook Series that concerned the Pacific Islands.[8] During this period Firth was based in Cambridge, where the LSE had its wartime home.\n Firth succeeded Malinowski as Professor of Social Anthropology at LSE in 1944, and he remained at the School for the next 24 years.[2] In the late 1940s he was a member of the Academic Advisory Committee of the then-fledgling Australian National University, along with Sir Howard Florey (co-developer of medicinal penicillin), Sir Mark Oliphant (a nuclear physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project), and Sir Keith Hancock (Chichele Professor of Economic History at Oxford). Firth was particularly focused on the creation of the university's School of Pacific Studies.[9]\n He returned to Tikopia on research visits several times, although as travel and fieldwork requirements became more burdensome he focused on family and kinship relationships in working- and middle-class London.[7] Firth left LSE in 1968, when he took up a year's appointment as Professor of Pacific Anthropology at the University of Hawai\u02bbi. There followed visiting professorships at British Columbia (1969), Cornell (1970), Chicago (1970\u20131), the Graduate School of the City University of New York (1971) and UC Davis (1974). The second festschrift published in his honour described him as 'perhaps the greatest living teacher of anthropology today'.[4]\n After retiring from teaching work, Firth continued with his research interests, and right up until his hundredth year he was producing articles. He died in London a few weeks before his 101st birthday: his father had lived to 104.\n Firth married Rosemary Firth (n\u00e9e Upcott) in 1936 and she died in 2001; they had one son, Hugh, who was born in 1946. He was raised a Methodist then later became a humanist and an atheist, a decision influenced by his anthropological studies.[11][12] He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.[13]\n Composed on behalf of the Polynesian Society by its then-President, Professor Sir Hugh Kawharu (English translation)[2]\n Sir Raymond Firth's papers are held at the London School of Economics \u2013 including his photographic collection\n ", "tags": ["Social anthropologists", "Economic anthropologists", "Anthropologists of religion", "British humanists", "New Zealand anthropologists", "Companions of the New Zealand Order of Merit", "Fellows of the British Academy", "Academics of the London School of Economics", "New Zealand centenarians", "1901 births", "2002 deaths", "People educated at Auckland Grammar School", "University of Auckland alumni", "New Zealand Knights Bachelor", "Presidents of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland", "Alumni of the London School of Economics", "20th-century anthropologists", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from November 2016", "Use dmy dates from November 2020", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 errors: dates", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nSir Raymond FirthCNZMFirth c.\u20091965Born(1901-03-25)25 March 1901Auckland, New ZealandDied22 February 2002(2002-02-22) (aged\u00a0100)London, EnglandAlma\u00a0materLondon School of EconomicsSpouse(s)Rosemary Upcott\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01936; died\u00a02001)\u200bScientific careerFieldsEthnologistThesisEconomic organisation of Polynesian societies: wealth and work of the Maori\u00a0(1927)Academic advisorsBronis\u0142aw MalinowskiDoctoral studentsEdmund LeachKenneth LittleJoan Metge\n\nPart of a series onEconomic, applied, and development anthropology\nBasic concepts\nCommodification\nBarter\nDebt\nFinance\nEmbeddedness\nReciprocity\nRedistribution\nValue\nWealth\nGift economy\nLimited good\nInalienable possessions\nSingularization (commodity pathway)\nSpheres of exchange\nSocial capital\nCultural capital\n\nProvisioning systems\nHunting-gathering\nPastoralism\nNomadic pastoralism\nShifting cultivation\nMoral economy\nPeasant economics\n\nCase studies\nPrestations\n\nKula ring\nMoka exchange\n\nPotlatch\nGifting\n\nGifting remittances\n\nOrgan gifting\nShell money\nProvisioning\n\nAch\u00e9 people (hunter-gatherers)\nBatek people\nColonialism and development\n\nThe Anti-Politics Machine\n\nEurope and the People Without History\nPolitical economy\n\nJim Crow economy\n\nRelated articles\nOriginal affluent society\nFormalist\u2013substantivist debate\nThe Great Transformation\nPeasant economics\nCulture of poverty\nPolitical economy\nState formation\nNutritional anthropology\nHeritage commodification\nAnthropology of development\n\nMajor theorists\nPaul Bohannan\nAlexander Chayanov\nStanley Diamond\nRaymond Firth\nMaurice Godelier\nDavid Graeber\nJane I.
