He was the head of the Laboratory for robotics and Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) at the Technion.\n Rubinovitz was born in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland, 6 September 1947. In 1957 he moved to Israel, in Aliath Gomulka, in the movement of Jews from Poland to Israel which started in 1956, after the Polish October. He graduated from the Faculty of Industrial engineering and Management at the Technion. From 1969 to 1973 he was a senior systems analyst at Mamram and senior systems analyst at Control Data (Israel). He managed the industrial software team (1973\u20131983) and initially worked at Israel Aerospace Industries, installing in several countries the industrial software developed. Software called Mass was installed at Escom ( South Africa ) and used for  maintenance of power plants.\n In 1987, at the end of his doctoral studies at Pennsylvania State University, he served a year as a visiting professor at the Department of Industrial Engineering at Pennsylvania State University. In 1988, he returned to Israel and joined the Industrial Engineering & Management department at Technion. He created and led the Laboratory of Robotics and CIM at the Technion.[1] Dr Hussein Naseraldin was his teaching assistant (currently he is a lecturer at the ORT Braude College of Engineering).[2] While Rubinovitz was a faculty member of The Faculty of Industrial Engineering & Management, he had a joint activity with his teaching assistant in the field of active learning. This activity resulted from the vision of promoting active learning among students of production and management. From 2003 to 2004 he taught industrial engineering at the Tel Aviv University. In 2005 he went on early retirement from the Technion due to illness.\n Rubinovitz published books and articles in his field. He was a member of the curriculum committee of Science and Technology Administration in the Ministry of Education in Israel\n In March 2012 he was the guest of honor at the national conference of Industrial Engineering and Management  in Israel - The 17th National Industrial Engineering And Management Conference.\n Rubinovitz married Nurit, and he is father of three (Ofer Sagi and Michal Slonim) and a grandfather of four (Yuval, Harel, Naveh and Ilai Slonim). Previously he lived in Mishmar HaShiv'a.\n ", "tags": ["1947 births", "Living people", "Polish Jews", "Polish emigrants to Israel", "Israeli industrial engineers", "Israeli roboticists", "Polish industrial engineers", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from April 2014", "Wikipedia articles with possible conflicts of interest from March 2013", "BLP articles lacking sources from March 2013", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with multiple maintenance issues", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Israeli engineer (born 1947)\n\n\nThis article has multiple issues.
