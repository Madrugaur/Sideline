{"name": "Katya Scheinberg", "content": "Katya Scheinberg is a Russian-American applied mathematician known for her research in continuous optimization and particularly in derivative-free optimization. She works at Cornell University and is a professor in the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering.\n Scheinberg was born in Moscow.[1]\nShe completed a bachelor's and master's degree in computational mathematics and cybernetics at Moscow State University in 1992,[2] and earned a Ph.D. in operations research at Columbia University in 1997. Her dissertation, Issues Related to Interior Point Methods for Linear and Semidefinite Programming, was supervised by Donald Goldfarb.[2][3]\n Scheinberg worked for IBM Research at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center from 1997 until 2009. After working as a research scientist at Columbia University and as an adjunct faculty member at New York University, she joined the Lehigh faculty in 2010. In July of 2019, she moved to Cornell to join the faculty in the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering.\n Scheinberg has been editor-in-chief of the SIAM-MOS Book Series on Optimization since 2014, and was the editor of Optima, the newsletter of the Mathematical Programming Society, from 2011 to 2013.[2]\nShe is part of Google Research Visiting Researcher Program.[4]\n Scheinberg works on the intersection of optimization and machine learning, in particular on kernel support vector machines.[5]\n With Andrew R. Conn and Lu\u00eds Nunes Vicente, Scheinberg authored the book Introduction to Derivative Free Optimization (SIAM Press, 2008).[6][7]\n Scheinberg became Wagner Professor at Lehigh in 2014.[2]\nIn 2015, with Conn and Vicente, she won the Lagrange Prize in Continuous Optimization of the Mathematical Optimization Society and Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics for their book.
