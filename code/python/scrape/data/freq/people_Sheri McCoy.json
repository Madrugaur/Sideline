{"name": "Sheri McCoy", "content": "Sherilyn S. McCoy (born 1959) is an American scientist and business executive. She is the former CEO of Avon Products and former vice chairman and member of the office of the chairman of Johnson & Johnson, where she was responsible for the pharmaceutical and consumer business divisions of the company. She was appointed as the vice chairman in January 2011, after which she was named by Fortune Magazine, as the 10th woman on their list of \"50 Most Powerful Women in Business\", a list on which she has been included since 2008.[4][5] In February 2012, she resigned her employment with Johnson & Johnson after 30 years and was subsequently named as the CEO of Avon Products. In August 2012, she was recognized as the 39th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes Magazine.[6]\n Sherilyn S. \"Sheri\" McCoy was born in 1959, in Quincy, Massachusetts. She attended the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, earning her Bachelor of Science degree in textile chemistry. In 1982, she earned a master's degree in chemical engineering from Princeton University.[1] She received her Master of Business Administration in 1988, from Rutgers University.[2] She holds five patents registered in the United States and Europe.[7]\n McCoy joined Johnson & Johnson as a chemical engineer in 1982,[4] where she focused on research and development of women's health products. She was eventually promoted to lead the company's research and development division, which was followed with a post as the global president of the division of the company that developed products that met the needs of infants, along with products that treated small injuries and wounds. In 2005, she was appointed to serve as the chairman of the Ethicon Endo-Surgery device division, where she was responsible for business in Latin America. She simultaneously served as a member of the Operating Committee of the Medical Device and Diagnostics Group.[2][8]\n In 2008, McCoy was appointed to chair the Surgical Care Group. This leadership role established her as a member of the company's Executive Committee and one of the highest-ranking female executives in the global drug industry.[9] On January 1, 2009, she was promoted to serve Johnson & Johnson as their Worldwide Chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Group, where she was responsible for new product development and distribution, along with acquisitions and partnerships. She also led the group during legal proceedings and loss of patent exclusivity. In 2010, she was promoted to Vice Chairman of the company.[8]\n In February 2012, after 30 years of employment with Johnson & Johnson, McCoy was passed over for a promotion to succeed William C. Weldon as chief executive officer. When Alex Gorsky, head of the industry trade association known as Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and CEO of Novartis was named to succeed Weldon, McCoy resigned from Johnson & Johnson, effective April 18, 2012.[4][10]\n In March 2012, French beauty products manufacturer, Coty attempted a takeover of Avon Products, presenting an unsolicited $10 billion buyout offer.[8] The bid was rejected by Avon shareholders, who believed that the company was worth more, stating that the monetary offer was way below the market value that would be feasible under the leadership of a new Chief Executive Officer. On April 9, 2012, just two weeks after the takeover was rejected, it was announced that McCoy was chosen to lead Avon Products as their new CEO, effective April 23, 2012.[11]\n In early August 2017, Sheri McCoy was \u201cterminated without cause\u201d from her position as Avon CEO. She had been negotiating an exit since June.[12] Sales had been depressed for several years.[13]\n While employed with Johnson & Johnson, McCoy represented the company as a member of the Board of Directors of PhRMA, the National Quality Forum, and the Institute of Medicine's Roundtable on Value & Science-Driven Health Care.[14]\n Following her appointment as CEO of Avon Products, McCoy continues to serve on the Board of Directors of For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST), a nonprofit organization based out of Manchester, New Hampshire, that focuses on developing programs designed to inspire students to consider a career in the fields of engineering and technology. She is additionally a member of the Rutgers University President's Business Leaders Cabinet, while simultaneously serving on the board of Stonehill College, a Roman Catholic liberal arts college located in Easton, Massachusetts.\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "Johnson & Johnson people", "American women scientists", "Princeton University alumni", "Rutgers University alumni", "University of Massachusetts Dartmouth alumni", "American chemical engineers", "1959 births", "American women chief executives", "People from Quincy, Massachusetts", "Businesspeople from Massachusetts", "American cosmetics businesspeople", "21st-century American businesspeople", "American chief executives of fashion industry companies", "Members of the National Academy of Medicine", "20th-century American chemists", "American chief executives of Fortune 500 companies", "People associated with direct selling", "21st-century American businesswomen", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "Business executive, scientist\nSheri McCoyBorn1959 (age\u00a061\u201362)Quincy, MassachusettsNationalityAmericanEducationBachelor of Science(Textile Chemistry)Master of Science(Chemical Engineering)[1]Master of Business Administration[2]Alma\u00a0materUniversity of Massachusetts, DartmouthPrinceton UniversityRutgers UniversityOccupationbusiness executive, scientistYears\u00a0active1982\u2013presentEmployerAvon ProductsKnown\u00a0forCEO of Avon Products;former Vice Chairman of Johnson & JohnsonPredecessorAndrea Jung[3]Children3 sons[4]\nSherilyn S.
