He is a winner of George Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society for a lifetime of scholarly achievement.\n Yushkevich was born in Odessa, then Russian Empire, in today's Ukraine, to a Jewish family.  His father was Pavel Yushkevich a Sorbonne-educated philosopher and a mathematician, active in politics as a Menshevik who was in \"ssylka\" (deportation) in Siberia, and later in France. His uncle, Semen Solomonovich Yushkevich was a well-known Jewish writer.

His doctoral advisor was Dmitri Egorov, but he was awarded a Ph.D. degree without a defense. From 1930 to 1952 he worked at Bauman Technical University where he rose to professorship in 1940 and head of the department of mathematics in 1941.  In the years 1941\u20131943 he was evacuated to Izhevsk, together with the whole Bauman Technical University. Starting 1952, he became a full-time researcher at Vavilov Institute of Natural History, where he worked until retirement.\n Yushkevich published over 300 works in history of mathematics.
