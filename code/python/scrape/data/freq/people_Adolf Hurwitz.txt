{"name": "Adolf Hurwitz", "content": "\n Adolf Hurwitz (German: [\u02c8a\u02d0d\u0254lf \u02c8h\u028a\u0281v\u026ats]; 26 March 1859 \u2013 18 November 1919) was a German mathematician who worked on algebra, analysis, geometry and number theory.\n He was born in Hildesheim, then part of the Kingdom of Hanover, to a Jewish family and died in Z\u00fcrich, in Switzerland. His father Salomon Hurwitz, a merchant, was not wealthy.  Hurwitz's mother, Elise Wertheimer, died when he was three years old.[1] Family records indicate that he had siblings and cousins, but their names have yet to be confirmed except for an older brother, Julius, with whom he developed an arithmetical theory for complex continued fractions circa 1890.[2] Hurwitz entered the Realgymnasium Andreanum\u00a0[de] in Hildesheim in 1868. He was taught mathematics there by Hermann Schubert.[3] Schubert persuaded Hurwitz's father to allow him to attend university, and arranged for Hurwitz to study with Felix Klein at Munich.[3] Salomon Hurwitz could not afford to send his son to university, but his friend Mr. Edwards, assisted financially.\n Hurwitz entered the University of Munich in 1877, aged 18. He spent one year there attending lectures by Klein, before spending the academic year 1877\u20131878 at the University of Berlin where he attended classes by Kummer, Weierstrass and Kronecker,[1] after which he returned to Munich.\n In October 1880, Felix Klein moved to the University of Leipzig. Hurwitz followed him there, and became a doctoral student under Klein's direction, finishing a dissertation on elliptic modular functions in 1881.  Following two years at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, in 1884 he was invited to become an Extraordinary Professor at the Albertus Universit\u00e4t in K\u00f6nigsberg; there he encountered the young David Hilbert and Hermann Minkowski, on whom he had a major influence. Following the departure of Frobenius, Hurwitz took a chair at the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Polytechnikum Z\u00fcrich (today the ETH Z\u00fcrich) in 1892 (having to turn down a position at G\u00f6ttingen shortly after [1]), and remained there for the rest of his life.\n Throughout his time in Z\u00fcrich, Hurwitz suffered from continual ill health, which had been originally caused when he contracted typhoid whilst a student in Munich. He suffered from severe migraines, and then in 1905, his kidneys became diseased and he had one removed.\n He was one of the early students of the Riemann surface theory, and used it to prove many of the foundational results on algebraic curves; for instance Hurwitz's automorphisms theorem. This work anticipates a number of later theories, such as the general theory of algebraic correspondences, Hecke operators, and Lefschetz fixed-point theorem. He also had deep interests in number theory. He studied the maximal order theory (as it now would be) for the quaternions, defining the Hurwitz quaternions that are now named for him. In the field of control systems and dynamical systems theory he derived the Routh\u2013Hurwitz stability criterion for determining whether a linear system is stable in 1895, independently of Edward John Routh who had derived it earlier by a different method.[4]\n In 1884, whilst at K\u00f6nigsberg, Hurwitz met and married Ida Samuel, the daughter of a professor in the faculty of medicine. They had three children.\n ", "tags": ["German Jews", "1859 births", "1919 deaths", "People from Hildesheim", "University of K\u00f6nigsberg faculty", "ETH Zurich faculty", "19th-century German mathematicians", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Leipzig University alumni", "People from the Kingdom of Hanover", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from June 2015", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\n\n\nAdolf HurwitzBorn(1859-03-26)26 March 1859Hildesheim, Kingdom of Hanover (now part of Germany)Died18 November 1919(1919-11-18) (aged\u00a060)Z\u00fcrich, SwitzerlandNationalityGermanyAlma\u00a0materLeipzig UniversityKnown\u00a0forRiemann\u2013Hurwitz formula Hurwitz quaternionScientific careerFieldsMathematicianInstitutionsETH Z\u00fcrichAlbertus Universit\u00e4t K\u00f6nigsbergDoctoral advisorFelix KleinDoctoral studentsL.
