{"name": "Don A. Allen", "content": "Don A. Allen, also known as Don A. Allen, Sr. (May 13, 1900 - August 1983), was a member of the California State Assembly in the 1940s and 1950s and of the Los Angeles City Council between 1947 and 1956.\n Allen was born on May 13, 1900 or 1907, in Atlantic, Iowa, the son of Thomas Allen of Missouri and Lillian M.
