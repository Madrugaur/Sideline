{"name": "John Duncan Watson", "content": "\n John Duncan Watson (7 March 1860\u20131946) was a British civil engineer.[1]\n Watson was born in Dundee, Scotland on 7 March 1860.[2] He specialised in sanitation and was regarded as a pioneer in the development of sewage treatment.[1] Watson was engineer to the Birmingham and District Drainage Board and also General Manager to the Birmingham, Tame and Rea District Drainage Board.[3] At Birmingham he was responsible for the construction of the first large-scale percolating filter plant, a complete departure from the traditional land treatment in use in the city and elsewhere.[1] Other changes that he introduced, based on his work in Birmingham, were the separation of sludge digestion, the extraction of methane from sewage for use in power generation and the introduction of flocculation prior to the percolating filter.[1] He drew up plans for sanitation works in the district of Aberdeen which included a pumping station at Denmill, reservoir at the Hill of Ord and water supply to the district of Culter. These plans are now held by the National Archives of Scotland.[4]\n Watson became General Manager of Birmingham Agricultural College by 1920 where he undertook investigations into tuberculosis in cattle. By 1920 he was also a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) and a fellow of the Royal Sanitary Institute.[3] Watson was elected president of the ICE for the November 1935 to November 1936 session.[5] In his retirement he joined his son, David Mowat Watson, who was also a member of the ICE, in his private engineering consultancy practice.[1] Watson died in Birmingham in 1946.[1] His son, David Watson followed in his footsteps in November 1954 by also becoming president of the ICE.[5]\n \n ", "tags": ["1860 births", "1946 deaths", "People from Dundee", "People educated at the High School of Dundee", "Scottish civil engineers", "British civil engineers", "Presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from April 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Use dmy dates from December 2017", "Use British English from December 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nJohn Duncan WatsonNationalityBritishOccupationEngineerEngineering careerDisciplineCivilInstitutionsInstitution of Civil Engineers (president)\n\nJohn Duncan Watson (7 March 1860\u20131946) was a British civil engineer.[1]\nWatson was born in Dundee, Scotland on 7 March 1860.[2] He specialised in sanitation and was regarded as a pioneer in the development of sewage treatment.[1] Watson was engineer to the Birmingham and District Drainage Board and also General Manager to the Birmingham, Tame and Rea District Drainage Board.[3] At Birmingham he was responsible for the construction of the first large-scale percolating filter plant, a complete departure from the traditional land treatment in use in the city and elsewhere.[1] Other changes that he introduced, based on his work in Birmingham, were the separation of sludge digestion, the extraction of methane from sewage for use in power generation and the introduction of flocculation prior to the percolating filter.[1] He drew up plans for sanitation works in the district of Aberdeen which included a pumping station at Denmill, reservoir at the Hill of Ord and water supply to the district of Culter.
