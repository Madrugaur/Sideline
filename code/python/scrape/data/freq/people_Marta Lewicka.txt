{"name": "Marta Lewicka", "content": "Marta Lewicka (born 23 November 1972) is a Polish-American professor of mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh, specializing in mathematical analysis. Lewicka has contributed results in the theory of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, fluid dynamics, calculus of variations, nonlinear elasticity, nonlinear potential theory and differential games.\n Lewicka earned bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics in 1996 from the University of Gda\u0144sk, and a second engineering bachelor's degree in computer science in 1998 from Cz\u0119stochowa University of Technology.[1] She completed her Ph.D. in 2000 from the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy under the supervision of Alberto Bressan.[1][2] After postdoctoral research at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig, Germany and a term as L.E.
