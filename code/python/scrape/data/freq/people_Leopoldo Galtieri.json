{"name": "Leopoldo Galtieri", "content": "\n Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri Castelli (Spanish pronunciation:\u00a0[leo\u02c8poldo fo\u027etu\u02c8nato \u0263al\u02c8tje\u027ei kas\u02c8teli]; 15 July 1926\u00a0\u2013  12 January 2003) was an Argentine general and President of Argentina from December 1981 to June 1982, during the last military dictatorship.[2]\n The death squad, 601 Intelligence Battalion, directly reported to him.[3] Having ordered the invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982, he was removed from power soon after the Argentine defeat by British armed forces in the Falklands War.\n Galtieri was an Italian Argentine born to working-class immigrant parents.[4] At 17 he enrolled at the National Military Academy to study civil engineering, and his early military career was as an officer in the engineering branch. As well as rising through the ranks of the Military, he continued his studies in engineering until the mid-1950s. In 1949 he graduated from the US Army School of the Americas.[5] In 1958, he became a professor of engineering at the Senior War College.[6]\n Galtieri was married to Luc\u00eda Noem\u00ed Gentili, and the couple had one son and two daughters.[7]\n In 1975, after more than 25 years as a combat engineer, Galtieri became commander of the  Argentine engineering corps. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the military coup that started the self-styled National Reorganisation Process in 1976 and rose further, becoming a major general in 1977, and commander-in-chief in 1980 with the rank of lieutenant general. During the junta's rule, Congress was suspended, trade unions, political parties, and provincial governments were banned, and in what became known as the Dirty War, between 9,000 and 30,000 people deemed left-wing subversives disappeared from society. Torture and mass executions were both commonplace. The economy, which had been in dire condition prior to the coup, recovered for a short time, then deteriorated further.\n In March 1981, Galtieri visited the United States and was warmly received, as the Reagan administration viewed the regime as a bulwark against communism. National Security Advisor Richard V. Allen described him as a \"majestic general\". An adherent to the Argentine military's Cold War-era doctrine of \"ideological frontiers\", Galtieri secured his country's support for rebel groups opposing the government in Nicaragua, the Contras; in August, he sent advisers to help organize the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN, for a time the principal Contra group), as well as training FDN leaders in Argentine bases. His support for this initiative allowed Galtieri to remove a number of rival generals.\n In December 1981, he rose to the Presidency of Argentina in a coup that ousted General Roberto Viola. Argentine support became the principal source of funds and training for the Contras during Galtieri's tenure.[8]\n Galtieri retained direct control of the army whilst President of the governing Military Junta and did not appoint a new commander-in-chief.[9]\n Galtieri instituted limited political reforms which allowed the expression of dissent, and anti-junta demonstrations soon became common, as did agitation for a return to democracy.[10]\n He appointed conservative economist and publisher Roberto Alemann as Economy Minister. Alemann inherited an economy in deep recession in the aftermath of Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz's economic policies of the late 1970s. Alemann slashed spending, began selling off government-owned industries (with only minor success), enacted a tight monetary policy, and ordered salaries frozen (amid 130% inflation).[11]\n The Central Bank Circular 1050, which tied mortgage rates to the value of the US dollar locally, was maintained, however, leading to further deepening of the crisis; GDP fell by 5%, and business investment by 20% over the weakened levels of 1981.[12]\n One of Galtieri's closest allies, the head of the First Army Corps, General Guillermo Su\u00e1rez Mason, was named Chairman of Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales (YPF), at the time the state petroleum concern, and the largest company of any type in Argentina. Su\u00e1rez Mason's turn at YPF would help result in a US$6 billion loss for the company\u00a0\u2013 the largest recorded corporate loss in the world, up to that point.[13]\n Galtieri supported the Central Intelligence Agency in its fight against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, while he was warmly welcomed during his visit to the White House.[14]\n Argentine military and intelligence cooperation with the Reagan Administration ended in 1982, when Argentina seized the British territory of the Falkland Islands in an attempt to quell domestic and economic unrest. The move was condemned by the US, who provided intelligence to the British government in its quest to regain control over the islands.\n By April 1982, Galtieri had been in office for four months and his popularity was low.[15] On 2 April, on his orders, Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands, a United Kingdom territory subject to a long-standing Argentine claim.\n Initially the invasion was popular in Argentina, and the anti-junta demonstrations were replaced by patriotic demonstrations in support of Galtieri.\n Galtieri and most of his government mistakenly believed the UK would not respond militarily[16] and that the United States would not interfere.[17]\n The British government led by the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, determined to overturn the invasion. It dispatched a seaborne task force to drive the Argentinian forces from the islands, resulting in the Falklands War and an Argentinian surrender on 14 June 1982.\n On 14 June 1982, the Falklands' capital, Stanley, was retaken by British forces. Within days Galtieri was removed from power, and he spent the next 18 months at a well-protected country retreat while democracy was restored to Argentina. Along with other members of the former junta, he was arrested in late 1983 and charged in a military court with human rights violations during the Dirty War and with mismanaging the Falklands War. The Argentine Army's internal investigation, known as the Rattenbach report after the general who led it,[18] recommended that those responsible for the misconduct of the war be prosecuted under the Code of Military Justice.[19] In 1986 he was sentenced to twelve years in prison.[20]\n Galtieri was cleared of the civil rights charges in December 1985, but (together with the Air Force and Navy commanders-in-chief) in May 1986 he was found guilty of mishandling the war and sentenced to prison. All three appealed in a civil court, and the prosecution appealed for heavier sentences. In November 1988 the original sentences were confirmed, and all three commanders were stripped of their rank. In 1989, Galtieri and 39 other officers of the dictatorship received President Carlos Menem's pardon.[21]\n Galtieri was heavily blamed for Argentina's humiliating defeat in the ill-conceived Falklands War. Following his release from prison, he moved to the Villa Devoto suburb of Buenos Aires, and lived modestly with his wife Luc\u00eda. He became a recluse and refused most requests for interviews by journalists, though in a rare interview he stated he had \"no regrets\" over anything he had done during the Dirty War. He lived on an army pension of about $1,800 per month, and attempted to claim a Presidential pension, but a judge denied it. In her ruling, the judge stated that his presidency had been illegal due to his never having been elected, and she also ordered him to pay court costs.\nIn May 2002, he was invited to the military parade of the Argentine Army for the celebrations of Argentine Army Day (D\u00eda del Ej\u00e9rcito Argentino): the presence of the former \"president de facto\" caused a huge controversy in public opinion after he was confronted and questioned by the journalist Mart\u00edn Ciccioli in the television programme Kaos en la Ciudad. [2]\n In July 2002, new civil charges were brought concerning the kidnapping of children and the disappearance of 18 leftist sympathizers in the late 1970s (while Galtieri was commander of the Second Army Corps), and the disappearance or death of three Spanish citizens at about the same time. Galtieri faced prosecution with 28 other officials, but due to his poor health, he was allowed to remain at home.[22][23]\n Leopoldo Galtieri underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer on 16 August 2002 at a hospital in Buenos Aires. He died there of a heart attack on 12 January 2003, aged 76.[24] His body was interred in a small mausoleum in La Chacarita Cemetery in the capital.[citation needed]\n ", "tags": ["1926 births", "2003 deaths", "Argentine anti-communists", "Argentine generals", "Argentine people of Calabrian descent", "Argentine people of Italian descent", "Argentine people of the Falklands War", "Burials at La Chacarita Cemetery", "Deaths from cancer in Argentina", "Deaths from pancreatic cancer", "Heads of government who were later imprisoned", "People acquitted of international crimes", "People from Mor\u00f3n Partido", "Presidents of Argentina", "Argentine politicians convicted of crimes", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles containing Spanish-language text", "CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)", "Use dmy dates from March 2021", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from April 2015", "All articles needing additional references", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from April 2015", "Pages using Sister project links with default search", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Galtieri and the second or maternal family name is  Castelli.\n40th President of Argentina\nLeopoldo GaltieriLeopoldo Galtieri in December 1981President of ArgentinaAppointed by the military juntaIn office22 December 1981\u00a0\u2013 18 June 1982Preceded byCarlos Lacoste (interim)Succeeded byAlfredo Oscar Saint Jean (acting)\nPersonal detailsBorn(1926-07-15)15 July 1926Caseros, Argentina[1]Died12 January 2003(2003-01-12) (aged\u00a076)Buenos Aires, ArgentinaPolitical partyNoneSpouse(s)Luc\u00eda Noem\u00ed Gentili \u200b(m.\u00a01949)\u200bChildren3Alma materColegio Militar de la Naci\u00f3nProfessionMilitarySignatureMilitary serviceAllegiance ArgentinaBranch/service Argentine ArmyYears\u00a0of service1944\u20131982Rank (Pre-1991 epaulette) Lieutenant GeneralBattles/warsFalklands War\nLeopoldo Fortunato Galtieri Castelli (Spanish pronunciation:\u00a0[leo\u02c8poldo fo\u027etu\u02c8nato \u0263al\u02c8tje\u027ei kas\u02c8teli]; 15 July 1926\u00a0\u2013  12 January 2003) was an Argentine general and President of Argentina from December 1981 to June 1982, during the last military dictatorship.[2]\nThe death squad, 601 Intelligence Battalion, directly reported to him.[3] Having ordered the invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982, he was removed from power soon after the Argentine defeat by British armed forces in the Falklands War.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Rise to power\n3 Presidency\n\n3.1 Political policy\n3.2 Economic policy\n3.3 Foreign policy\n3.4 Falklands War\n\n\n4 Defeat, fall from power, trial and prison\n5 Later life, further accusations\n6 Death\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nGaltieri was an Italian Argentine born to working-class immigrant parents.[4] At 17 he enrolled at the National Military Academy to study civil engineering, and his early military career was as an officer in the engineering branch.
