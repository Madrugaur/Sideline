{"name": "Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester", "content": "\n Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester (9 March 1602 or 9 March 1603\u00a0\u2013 3 April 1667),[1] styled Lord Herbert of Raglan from 1628\u20131644, was an English nobleman involved in royalist politics, and an inventor.\n While Earl of Glamorgan, he was sent by Charles I to negotiate a peace treaty and alliance with the leadership of the Catholic Irish Confederacy. He enjoyed some success, but the agreement quickly broke down. He then joined the Confederates, and was appointed the commander of their Munster Army.\n In 1655 he published The Century of Inventions, detailing more than 100 inventions, including a device that would have been one of the earliest steam engines.[2]\n He was the son of Henry Somerset, 1st Marquess of Worcester by his wife Anne Russell, a daughter of John Russell, Baron Russell, eldest son and heir apparent of Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford.\n Edward Somerset was brought up as a Roman Catholic in Monmouthshire. He graduated from Cambridge University, England, in 1627 with a Master of Arts (MA) degree.[3] In his day he was one of the richest lords in England, funding his experiments, later self-funding his military endeavours, and sending large amounts of money to King Charles I during the English Civil War. He was a Cavalier who supported the King in Wales, where he raised a regiment of horse for him. His campaigning in the West of England and in Wales, however, did not go well.[4] After a month with his force of over 2,000 troops encamped at Highnam, outside Gloucester, in March 1643 Herbert left them and travelled to meet the king at Oxford. In his absence the entire force surrendered without any exchange of fire, earning it the title \"The Mushroom Army\" (they appeared and disappeared very quickly). He was rewarded in 1644, however, with a peerage, being created Earl of Glamorgan and Baron Beaufort of Caldecote.[5] Due to irregularities in the letters patent, these titles were not recognised after the Restoration.\n Sent to Ireland, he made a false move in concluding a treaty, in great secrecy, on behalf of Charles that was considered to concede too much to the Catholics there; he himself was a Catholic.[6] In extricating himself from that position, he became a close ally of Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, and a potential replacement for James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde as royalist leader.[7] His plans to bring Irish troops over to England were overtaken by events, and he left for France with George Leyburn.[8] He succeeded his father as Marquess of Worcester in 1646.\n He was formally banished in 1649, but after four years in Paris returned to England in 1653. He was discovered, charged with high treason and sent to the Tower of London; he was treated leniently by the Council of State, and released on bail in 1654.[8] That year he took up again his interest in engineering and inventions, leasing a house at Vauxhall where his Dutch or German technician Kaspar Kalthoff could work.[9] After the Restoration his estates were restored,[10] but he largely avoided politics, and did not press his claims to the various other titles of nobility.\n In 1655 he authored a book which consisted of textual descriptions of 100 separate inventions.[11] It was eventually printed in 1663 and included a device described as his \"Water-commanding Engine\". Constructed from the barrel of a cannon, it was an obvious prototype design for what would later become the steam engine, and clearly anticipated the power and applications of that machine.[12]\n In 1663 Samuel Sorbi\u00e8re visited Edward's Vauxhall workshop and saw and described the \"hydraulic machine which the Marquis of Worcester has invented.\" It was designed for purposes of irrigation, and would \"raise to the height of forty feet, by the strength of one man and in the space of one minute of time, four large buckets of water.\" Cosimo de' Medici, Duke of Tuscany, visited it in 1669, when a similar description was given. Robert Hooke, however, described it as \"one of the perpetual motion fallacies.\"[1]\n Edward suggested that when he died, a model of his engine should be buried with him. Almost 200 years later, in 1861, this prompted Victorian collector Bennet Woodcroft to mount an expedition, on behalf of the London Science Museum, to the vault of Raglan church, to try to find a model of the invention in Somerset's tomb.[13] Despite opening the coffin lid and searching thoroughly, no model was found. Woodcroft did, however, return with one of Edward's fingernails.\n He married twice:\n After his death his widow remarried Donough Kearney, who was charged with treason during the Popish Plot,  but acquitted.\n ", "tags": ["1600s births", "1667 deaths", "Deputy Lieutenants of Monmouthshire", "Marquesses of Worcester", "Somerset family", "English Roman Catholics", "English inventors", "Barons Herbert", "Articles incorporating Cite DNB template", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 errors: requires URL", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "EngvarB from August 2014", "Use dmy dates from August 2014", "Articles needing additional references from January 2016", "All articles needing additional references", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the New International Encyclopedia", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DIB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For other people named Edward Somerset, see Edward Somerset (disambiguation).\n\n\nThe Marquess of WorcesterPortrait by Alexander Craig (1856), after an original by Sir Anthony van Dyck (c. 1640) (oil on canvas)Born9 March 1602 or 9 March 1603Died3 April 1667Noble familyHouse of SomersetSpouse(s)Elizabeth DormerMargaret O'BrienIssue\nHenry Somerset, 3rd Marquess of WorcesterAnne SomersetElizabeth SomersetMary SomersetFatherHenry Somerset, 1st Marquess of WorcesterMotherAnne Russell\n Coat of arms of Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester: Quarterly of 4: 1:Beaufort, 2:Herbert, 3:Woodville, 4:Russell.
