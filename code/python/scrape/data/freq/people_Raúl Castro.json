{"name": "Ra\u00fal Castro", "content": "\n Ra\u00fal Modesto Castro Ruz (/\u02c8k\u00e6stro\u028a/;[6] American Spanish:\u00a0[ra\u02c8ul mo\u02c8\u00f0esto \u02c8kast\u027eo \u02c8rus]; born 3 June 1931) is a Cuban politician who is currently serving as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, the most senior position in the one-party communist state,[7] succeeding his brother, Fidel Castro, in April 2011.\n Castro has also been a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, the highest decision-making body, since 1975. He served as the Minister of the Armed Forces from 1959 to 2008. His ministerial tenure made him the longest-serving minister of the armed forces. Because of his brother's illness, Castro became the acting President of the Council of State in a temporary transfer of power from 31 July 2006.\n Castro was officially made President by the National Assembly on 24 February 2008, after his brother, who was still ailing, announced on 19 February 2008 that he would not stand again. He was re-elected President on 24 February 2013. Shortly thereafter, Castro announced that his second term would be his final term, and that he would not seek re-election in 2018.[8][9] He stepped down from the presidency on 19 April 2018 after his successor, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel was elected by the National Assembly following parliamentary elections. Castro remains the First Secretary of the Communist Party,[7] is head of the constitutional reform commission,[10] and also continues to have a seat representing Santiago de Cuba's Segundo Frente municipality in the National Assembly.[11] He is still reckoned as the de facto leader of the country, retaining oversight over his successor.[12]\n He is expected to step down as First Secretary at the Eighth Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba, which is scheduled to take place on 16 to 19 April 2021.[13][14]\n Ra\u00fal Modesto Castro Ruz was born in Bir\u00e1n, Cuba, the son of a Spanish immigrant father, \u00c1ngel Castro who was 55 at the time of his birth, and a Cuban-born mother of Canarian parentage, Lina Ruz. Ra\u00fal is the youngest of three brothers: Ram\u00f3n, Fidel, and himself.[15] He also has four sisters: Angela, Juanita, Emma, and Agustina. \u00c1ngel Castro's first wife, Maria Argota, also raised five half-siblings of Ra\u00fal: Pedro Emilio, Maria Lidia, Manuel, Antonia, and Georgina.\n As children, the Castro brothers were expelled from the first school they attended. Like Fidel, Ra\u00fal later attended the Jesuit School of Colegio Dolores in Santiago and Belen Jesuit Preparatory School (Spanish: Colegio Bel\u00e9n) in Havana. Ra\u00fal as an undergraduate studied social sciences. Whereas Fidel excelled as a student, Ra\u00fal turned in mostly mediocre performances.[16] Ra\u00fal became a committed socialist and joined the Socialist Youth, an affiliate of the Soviet-oriented Cuban Communist Party, Partido Socialista Popular (PSP).[17][18]\nThe brothers participated actively in sometimes violent student actions.[19]\n Ra\u00fal Castro's travels and contact with Soviet KGB agent Nikolai Leonov\u00a0\u2014 whom he met in 1953 during a trip to the Soviet-bloc nations and again in 1955 during his exile in Mexico City\u00a0\u2014 facilitated Cuba's close ties with the Soviets after the triumph of the Cuban Revolution. Leonov would later become the USSR's KGB agent in Havana.[17]\n In 1953, Ra\u00fal served as a member of the 26th of July Movement group that attacked the Moncada Barracks; he received a 13-year prison sentence and spent 22 months in prison as a result of this action.[20][21] During his subsequent exile in Mexico, he participated in the preparations for the expedition of the boat Granma to Cuba.\n When the Granma landing failed and the 82 expeditionaries were detected by government troops soon after, Ra\u00fal was one of only 12 fighters who managed to reach a safe haven in the Sierra Maestra mountains, forming the core of the nascent rebel army (see the Cuban Revolution). As Fidel's brother and trusted right-hand man, and given his proven leadership abilities during and after the Moncada attack, he was given progressively bigger commands. On 27 February 1958 Ra\u00fal was made comandante and assigned the mission to cross the old province of Oriente leading a column of guerrillas to open, to the northeast of that territory, the \"Frank Pa\u00eds Eastern Front\".\n As a result of Ra\u00fal's \"Eastern Front\" operations, he was not involved in the pivotal Operation Verano (which came close to destroying the main body of fighters but ended up a spectacular victory for Fidel), but Ra\u00fal's forces remained active and grew over time.\n On 26 June 1958, Ra\u00fal Castro's rebels kidnapped ten Americans and two Canadians from the property of Moa Bay Mining Company (an American company) on the north coast of Oriente Province. The next day rebels took hostage 24 U.S. servicemen on leave from the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay. This incident brought total kidnapped hostages to 36 (34 U.S. and 2 Canadian citizens).\n U.S. Ambassador Earl E. T. Smith and his staff determined the kidnappings had the following objectives: Obtain worldwide publicity, regain M-26-7 prestige lost by general strike call failure, force Batista's Air Force to stop bombing rebel holds, and gain public recognition from the U.S. Two tactical objectives the kidnapping achieved for Castro forces can be discerned from contemporaneous reporting in Time: Batista declaring a ceasefire for negotiations, forcing a reduction in Operation Verano air raids; the rebels used the lulls to regroup and fly in arms.\n The hostage-taking caused significant U.S. backlash, including unfavorable public reaction, and U.S. consideration to re-establishing military support to Batista and deploying U.S. forces to free the hostages. Ultimately, the hostages were released in very small groups, extracting the maximum press attention.[22] After their release, the hostages said they were treated well with some even claiming to support the rebel cause.[23]\n Regarding the captured Batista government soldiers, Ra\u00fal Castro notes in his war diaries: \"All three were brought food and told that they would be released and only their weapons would be kept. They had money and watches we needed, but according to our principles, we didn't touch them. In the territories under guerrilla control, it created an autonomous structure by establishing hospitals, schools and several material manufacturing plants. In 1958, he was also at the origin of the M-26 intelligence services.[24]\n By October 1958, after reinforcement by Fidel, the brothers had about 2,000 fighters and were operating freely throughout Oriente province. In December, while Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos were operating in Santa Clara, Fidel and Ra\u00fal's army laid siege to Maffo, capturing it on 30 December. Their victorious army then headed to Santiago de Cuba, capital of Oriente province.\n In response to the victory by Che Guevara at the Battle of Santa Clara, the U.S.-backed President Fulgencio Batista fled Cuba in the early morning of 1 January 1959.[25] The two Castro brothers with their army arrived on the outskirts of Santiago de Cuba and said their forces would storm the city at 6\u00a0P.M. on 1 January if it did not first surrender. The commander (Colonel Rego Rubido) surrendered Santiago de Cuba without a fight. The war was over and Fidel was able to take power in Havana when he arrived on 8 January 1959.\n Ra\u00fal's abilities as a military leader during the revolution are hard to see clearly. Unlike Che Guevara or Cienfuegos, Ra\u00fal had no significant victories he could claim credit for on his own. The last operations (which were clearly successful) were conducted with his older brother Fidel present (and in command).[26] After Batista's fall, Ra\u00fal had the task of overseeing trials and execution of between 30 and 70 soldiers loyal to deposed president Batista who had been convicted of war crimes.[27]\n Ra\u00fal Castro Ruz was a member of the national leadership of the Integrated Revolutionary PO Organizations (established July 1961; dissolved March 1962) and of the United Party of the Socialist Revolution of Cuba (established March 1962; dissolved October 1965). He is also credited with helping shoot down a Lockheed U2 and killing Major Rudolf Anderson.[28]\n He served as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba and Second Secretary of its Politburo from the Party's formation in October 1965; also as First Vice President of the Cuban Council of State of the National Assembly of People's Power and Council of Ministers when these were established in 1976. He was appointed Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces when it was founded in October 1959 and served in that capacity until February 2008.[citation needed]\n On 31 July 2006, Fidel Castro's personal secretary, Carlos Valenciaga, announced on state-run television that Fidel Castro would provisionally hand over the duties of First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba (party chief), President of the Council of State of Cuba (head of state), President of the Council of Ministers of Cuba (prime minister), and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to Ra\u00fal Castro while Fidel underwent and recovered from intestinal surgery to repair gastrointestinal bleeding.[29][30]\n Many[quantify] commentators regarded Ra\u00fal Castro as a political hardliner who would maintain the Communist Party of Cuba's influence in the country. However, others believed that he was more pragmatic than his older brother and willing to institute some market-oriented economic policies. It was speculated[by whom?] that he favored a variant of the current Chinese and Vietnamese political and economic model for Cuba in the hopes of preserving some elements of the socialist system.[27]\n Ra\u00fal is considered by some[who?] to be less charismatic than his brother Fidel Castro, who remained largely out of public view during the transfer-of-duty period.[31] His few public appearances included hosting a gathering of leaders of the Non-Aligned nations in September 2006, and leading the national commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the landing of the boat Granma, which also became Fidel's belated 80th-birthday celebrations.[32][33]\n In a speech to university students, Ra\u00fal stated that a communist system in Cuba would remain, and that \"Fidel is irreplaceable, unless we all replace him together.\"[34]\n On 1 May 2007 Ra\u00fal presided over the May Day celebrations in Havana. According to Granma the crowd reached over one million participants, with delegations from over 225 organizations and 52 countries.[35]\n Ra\u00fal has a reputation for his businesslike, unanimated delivery of speeches.[36]\n After assuming what was envisioned[by whom?] as a temporary control over the presidency in 2006, on 24 February 2008 Ra\u00fal Castro won election as the new President of the Council of State and President of the Council of Ministers during a legislative session held at Cuba's Palace of Conventions in Havana. The 597 deputies unanimously elected a 31-member Council of State for a term of five years, which in turn elected Ra\u00fal as president.[37] His administration subsequently announced several economic reforms. In March 2008 the government removed restrictions on the purchase of numerous products not available under Fidel Castro's administration - including DVD-players, computers, rice cookers, and microwaves.[38] In an effort to boost food production, the government allowed private farmers and cooperatives to lease idle state-owned land and moved much of the decision-making process regarding land use from the national level to the municipal level.[39]\n All death sentences (about 30) are commuted between 2008 and 2010, although none had been executed since 2003.[40]\n In mid-2008, the government overhauled the salary structure of all state-run companies so that harder-working employees could earn higher wages.[41] In addition, the government removed restrictions against the use of cell phones and investigated the removal of travel restrictions on Cubans.[38]\n In March 2009, Ra\u00fal Castro dismissed some officials.\n In April 2011, Ra\u00fal announced a plan of 300 economic reforms encouraging private initiative, reducing state spending, encouraging foreign investment and agrarian reforms. He also announced a limitation on presidential terms, including his own.\n On 24 February 2013, Cuba's parliament named Ra\u00fal Castro to a new five-year term as president and appointed Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel as his first vice president. Castro announced that day that he would step down from power after his second term as president ended in 2018.[42]\n In 2018, he was selected as a candidate for the National Assembly of People's Power by the Segundo Frente municipality in Santiago de Cuba, regarded[by whom?] as the cradle of the Cuban Revolution.[43]\n Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel took over as President of Cuba (President of the Council of State) on 19 April 2018. Ra\u00fal Castro remains First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (in office since 19 April 2011).\n Ra\u00fal Castro said in a 2008 interview: \"The American people are among our closest neighbors. We should respect each other. We have never held anything against the American people. Good relations would be mutually advantageous. Perhaps we cannot solve all of our problems, but we can solve a good many of them.\"[44]\n On 10 December 2013, Castro, in a significant move, shook hands with and greeted  American President Barack Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.[45]\n On 17 December 2014 Castro and Obama made separate announcements to the effect that efforts to normalize relations between the two nations would  begin with the re-establishment of embassies in Havana and  Washington. Direct diplomatic relations had previously ceased in 1961 after Cuba became closely allied with the USSR.[46][47]\n Argentine-born Pope Francis facilitated the rapprochement between the U.S. and Cuba, allowing the Vatican to be used for secret negotiations. Castro and Obama made simultaneous public announcements about the progress toward normalization.[48]\n On 20 July 2015 Cuba and the United States officially resumed full diplomatic relations with the sections of  \"Cuban interests\" in Washington, D.C., and  \"U.S. interests\" in Havana upgraded to embassies.[49]\n On 20 March 2016 Obama made a visit to Cuba to meet with Castro - the first visit of a sitting U.S. president to Cuba in 88 years.[50]\n Speaking in 2017, Castro criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's proposition of the Mexican wall and restrictive trade policy. Castro called Trump's plans egotistical and - for the border - irrational. \"You can't contain poverty, catastrophes, and migrants with walls, but with cooperation, understanding, and peace,\" Castro said.[51] In November 2016 Trump (as U.S. President-elect) targeted Ra\u00fal in a tweet, saying, \"If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal\".[52]\n Castro surprised a top American envoy in September 2017 while discussing sonic attacks on American diplomatic staff. He denied involvement but allowed FBI rare access to investigate the incident that allegedly left 21 people with hearing loss and brain damage.[53]\n In September 2019 the United States sanctioned Castro and barred him from entering the U.S. due to Cuba's support of the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro government in Venezuela during the presidential crisis and alleged human-rights abuses caused by the government.[54]\n Castro married Vilma Esp\u00edn, a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology chemical engineering student and the daughter of a wealthy lawyer for the Bacardi rum company, on 26 January 1959.[55] Vilma became president of the Cuban Federation of Women.[56] They have three daughters (D\u00e9borah, Mariela, and Nilsa) and one son (Alejandro) Castro Esp\u00edn.[57] Vilma Esp\u00edn died on 18 June 2007.\n Alejandro is a Colonel in the Ministry of the Interior, as director of the office of Intelligence Coordination between MININT and MINFAR, with full oversight and access to all of the activities of the Intelligence services. Most foreign analysts consider him to be the \"czar\" of Cuban Intelligence and Raul's link to maintaining control over MININT, balancing it with his own control of MINFAR. He is widely viewed as Raul's most trusted advisor and is likely being prepared for a future leadership role.[58] Their daughter Mariela Castro currently heads the Cuban National Center for Sex Education, while D\u00e9borah is married to Colonel Luis Alberto Rodr\u00edguez, head of GAESA, the Armed Forces' economic division. He is widely regarded as one of the most powerful figures in the Cuban Economy due to the Military's hold on most of the lucrative business sectors.[59] Deborah's son, Raul Guillermo, nicknamed El Cangrejo (The Crab) due to a malformed finger, is Raul's current chief bodyguard. [60]\n In an interview in 2006, following his assumption of presidential duties, Ra\u00fal Castro commented on his public profile stating: \"I am not used to making frequent appearances in public, except at times when it is required ... I have always been discreet, that is my way, and in passing I will clarify that I am thinking of continuing in that way\".[61]\n In an interview with actor Sean Penn, Castro was described as \"warm, open, energetic, and sharp of wit\".[44] However, Juan Reynaldo Sanchez, a defected bodyguard for Fidel who knew Raul well, wrote later that his warm public exterior was a carefully maintained fa\u00e7ade; In private, he found him to be \"rough, curt, almost unpleasant\" with a dubious sense of humor.[62] Nevertheless though, Sanchez considered Raul the true \"architect\" of the Castroist system, despite having a polar opposite personality to Fidel. Whereas Fidel was \"charismatic, energetic, visionary but extremely impulsive and totally disorganized\", Raul was described as a \"natural, methodical, and uncompromising organizer\".[63]\n After a meeting with Pope Francis in Vatican City on 10 May 2015, Castro said that he would conditionally consider returning to the Roman Catholic Church.[64] He said in a televised news conference, \"I read all the speeches of the pope, his commentaries, and if the pope continues this way, I will go back to praying and go back to the [Roman Catholic] church. I am not joking.\"[48] The pope visited Cuba before his September 2015 visit to the United States. Castro said: \"I promise to go to all his Masses and with satisfaction,\" when Pope Francis visited Cuba in 2015.[65] Castro considered Christ a communist stating, \"I think that's why they killed Jesus, for being a communist, for doing what Fidel defined as revolution... changing the situation.\"[66]\n In the 1969 American film Che!, Castro was played by Paul Bertoya. In the 2002 film Fidel, he was played by Maurice Comte. In the 2008 American biographical film Che, he was played by Rodrigo Santoro.\n ", "tags": ["Presidents of Cuba", "Communist rulers", "Fidel Castro family", "1931 births", "Living people", "Cuban communists", "Cuban revolutionaries", "First Secretaries of the Communist Party of Cuba", "Government ministers of Cuba", "Members of the National Assembly of People's Power", "People of the Cuban Revolution", "Presidents pro tempore of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States", "Prime Ministers of Cuba", "Secretaries-General of the Non-Aligned Movement", "Vice Presidents of Cuba", "People from Mayar\u00ed", "Cuban people of Galician descent", "Cuban people of Canarian descent", "Che Guevara", "Recipients of the Order of Holy Prince Daniel of Moscow", "Recipients of the Order of Lenin", "Recipients of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise, 1st class", "Recipients of the National Order of Mali", "2000s in Cuba", "2010s in Cuba", "20th-century Cuban politicians", "21st-century Cuban politicians", "Cuban nationalists", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from April 2018", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from August 2020", "Articles containing Spanish-language text", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from November 2016", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2018", "Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from February 2018", "All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases", "Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2019", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Webarchive template other archives", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article is about the current First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba and former President of Cuba.

In December, while Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos were operating in Santa Clara, Fidel and Ra\u00fal's army laid siege to Maffo, capturing it on 30 December. Their victorious army then headed to Santiago de Cuba, capital of Oriente province.\nIn response to the victory by Che Guevara at the Battle of Santa Clara, the U.S.-backed President Fulgencio Batista fled Cuba in the early morning of 1 January 1959.[25] The two Castro brothers with their army arrived on the outskirts of Santiago de Cuba and said their forces would storm the city at 6\u00a0P.M. on 1 January if it did not first surrender. The commander (Colonel Rego Rubido) surrendered Santiago de Cuba without a fight. The war was over and Fidel was able to take power in Havana when he arrived on 8 January 1959.\nRa\u00fal's abilities as a military leader during the revolution are hard to see clearly. Unlike Che Guevara or Cienfuegos, Ra\u00fal had no significant victories he could claim credit for on his own. The last operations (which were clearly successful) were conducted with his older brother Fidel present (and in command).[26] After Batista's fall, Ra\u00fal had the task of overseeing trials and execution of between 30 and 70 soldiers loyal to deposed president Batista who had been convicted of war crimes.[27]\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nEarly political career[edit]\nRa\u00fal Castro Ruz was a member of the national leadership of the Integrated Revolutionary PO Organizations (established July 1961; dissolved March 1962) and of the United Party of the Socialist Revolution of Cuba (established March 1962; dissolved October 1965). He is also credited with helping shoot down a Lockheed U2 and killing Major Rudolf Anderson.[28]\nHe served as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba and Second Secretary of its Politburo from the Party's formation in October 1965; also as First Vice President of the Cuban Council of State of the National Assembly of People's Power and Council of Ministers when these were established in 1976. He was appointed Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces when it was founded in October 1959 and served in that capacity until February 2008.[citation needed]\n\nAssumption of presidential duties[edit]\nSee also: 2006\u20132008 Cuban transfer of presidential duties\n Castro with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, 28 November 2008\nOn 31 July 2006, Fidel Castro's personal secretary, Carlos Valenciaga, announced on state-run television that Fidel Castro would provisionally hand over the duties of First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba (party chief), President of the Council of State of Cuba (head of state), President of the Council of Ministers of Cuba (prime minister), and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to Ra\u00fal Castro while Fidel underwent and recovered from intestinal surgery to repair gastrointestinal bleeding.[29][30]\nMany[quantify] commentators regarded Ra\u00fal Castro as a political hardliner who would maintain the Communist Party of Cuba's influence in the country. However, others believed that he was more pragmatic than his older brother and willing to institute some market-oriented economic policies. It was speculated[by whom?] that he favored a variant of the current Chinese and Vietnamese political and economic model for Cuba in the hopes of preserving some elements of the socialist system.[27]\nRa\u00fal is considered by some[who?] to be less charismatic than his brother Fidel Castro, who remained largely out of public view during the transfer-of-duty period.[31] His few public appearances included hosting a gathering of leaders of the Non-Aligned nations in September 2006, and leading the national commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the landing of the boat Granma, which also became Fidel's belated 80th-birthday celebrations.[32][33]\nIn a speech to university students, Ra\u00fal stated that a communist system in Cuba would remain, and that \"Fidel is irreplaceable, unless we all replace him together.\"[34]\nOn 1 May 2007 Ra\u00fal presided over the May Day celebrations in Havana. According to Granma the crowd reached over one million participants, with delegations from over 225 organizations and 52 countries.[35]\nRa\u00fal has a reputation for his businesslike, unanimated delivery of speeches.[36]\n\nCommunist leader[edit]\n Ra\u00fal Castro with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, 2010\n Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner meets Ra\u00fal Castro in Cuba during a state visit in January 2009After assuming what was envisioned[by whom?] as a temporary control over the presidency in 2006, on 24 February 2008 Ra\u00fal Castro won election as the new President of the Council of State and President of the Council of Ministers during a legislative session held at Cuba's Palace of Conventions in Havana. The 597 deputies unanimously elected a 31-member Council of State for a term of five years, which in turn elected Ra\u00fal as president.[37] His administration subsequently announced several economic reforms. In March 2008 the government removed restrictions on the purchase of numerous products not available under Fidel Castro's administration - including DVD-players, computers, rice cookers, and microwaves.[38] In an effort to boost food production, the government allowed private farmers and cooperatives to lease idle state-owned land and moved much of the decision-making process regarding land use from the national level to the municipal level.[39]\nAll death sentences (about 30) are commuted between 2008 and 2010, although none had been executed since 2003.[40]\nIn mid-2008, the government overhauled the salary structure of all state-run companies so that harder-working employees could earn higher wages.[41] In addition, the government removed restrictions against the use of cell phones and investigated the removal of travel restrictions on Cubans.[38]\nIn March 2009, Ra\u00fal Castro dismissed some officials.\nIn April 2011, Ra\u00fal announced a plan of 300 economic reforms encouraging private initiative, reducing state spending, encouraging foreign investment and agrarian reforms. He also announced a limitation on presidential terms, including his own.\nOn 24 February 2013, Cuba's parliament named Ra\u00fal Castro to a new five-year term as president and appointed Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel as his first vice president. Castro announced that day that he would step down from power after his second term as president ended in 2018.[42]\nIn 2018, he was selected as a candidate for the National Assembly of People's Power by the Segundo Frente municipality in Santiago de Cuba, regarded[by whom?] as the cradle of the Cuban Revolution.[43]\nMiguel D\u00edaz-Canel took over as President of Cuba (President of the Council of State) on 19 April 2018. Ra\u00fal Castro remains First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (in office since 19 April 2011).\n\nNormalization of relations with the United States[edit]\nSee also: United States\u2013Cuban Thaw\n Ra\u00fal Castro with Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, 2008\n President Castro meets with Barack Obama in Havana, 22 March 2016\nRa\u00fal Castro said in a 2008 interview: \"The American people are among our closest neighbors. We should respect each other. We have never held anything against the American people. Good relations would be mutually advantageous. Perhaps we cannot solve all of our problems, but we can solve a good many of them.\"[44]\nOn 10 December 2013, Castro, in a significant move, shook hands with and greeted  American President Barack Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.[45]\nOn 17 December 2014 Castro and Obama made separate announcements to the effect that efforts to normalize relations between the two nations would  begin with the re-establishment of embassies in Havana and  Washington. Direct diplomatic relations had previously ceased in 1961 after Cuba became closely allied with the USSR.[46][47]\nArgentine-born Pope Francis facilitated the rapprochement between the U.S. and Cuba, allowing the Vatican to be used for secret negotiations. Castro and Obama made simultaneous public announcements about the progress toward normalization.[48]\nOn 20 July 2015 Cuba and the United States officially resumed full diplomatic relations with the sections of  \"Cuban interests\" in Washington, D.C., and  \"U.S. interests\" in Havana upgraded to embassies.[49]\nOn 20 March 2016 Obama made a visit to Cuba to meet with Castro - the first visit of a sitting U.S. president to Cuba in 88 years.[50]\nSpeaking in 2017, Castro criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's proposition of the Mexican wall and restrictive trade policy. Castro called Trump's plans egotistical and - for the border - irrational. \"You can't contain poverty, catastrophes, and migrants with walls, but with cooperation, understanding, and peace,\" Castro said.[51] In November 2016 Trump (as U.S. President-elect) targeted Ra\u00fal in a tweet, saying, \"If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal\".[52]\nCastro surprised a top American envoy in September 2017 while discussing sonic attacks on American diplomatic staff. He denied involvement but allowed FBI rare access to investigate the incident that allegedly left 21 people with hearing loss and brain damage.[53]\nIn September 2019 the United States sanctioned Castro and barred him from entering the U.S. due to Cuba's support of the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro government in Venezuela during the presidential crisis and alleged human-rights abuses caused by the government.[54]\n\nPublic and personal life[edit]\nCastro married Vilma Esp\u00edn, a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology chemical engineering student and the daughter of a wealthy lawyer for the Bacardi rum company, on 26 January 1959.[55] Vilma became president of the Cuban Federation of Women.[56] They have three daughters (D\u00e9borah, Mariela, and Nilsa) and one son (Alejandro) Castro Esp\u00edn.[57] Vilma Esp\u00edn died on 18 June 2007.\nAlejandro is a Colonel in the Ministry of the Interior, as director of the office of Intelligence Coordination between MININT and MINFAR, with full oversight and access to all of the activities of the Intelligence services. Most foreign analysts consider him to be the \"czar\" of Cuban Intelligence and Raul's link to maintaining control over MININT, balancing it with his own control of MINFAR. He is widely viewed as Raul's most trusted advisor and is likely being prepared for a future leadership role.[58] Their daughter Mariela Castro currently heads the Cuban National Center for Sex Education, while D\u00e9borah is married to Colonel Luis Alberto Rodr\u00edguez, head of GAESA, the Armed Forces' economic division. He is widely regarded as one of the most powerful figures in the Cuban Economy due to the Military's hold on most of the lucrative business sectors.[59] Deborah's son, Raul Guillermo, nicknamed El Cangrejo (The Crab) due to a malformed finger, is Raul's current chief bodyguard. [60]\nIn an interview in 2006, following his assumption of presidential duties, Ra\u00fal Castro commented on his public profile stating: \"I am not used to making frequent appearances in public, except at times when it is required ... I have always been discreet, that is my way, and in passing I will clarify that I am thinking of continuing in that way\".[61]\nIn an interview with actor Sean Penn, Castro was described as \"warm, open, energetic, and sharp of wit\".[44] However, Juan Reynaldo Sanchez, a defected bodyguard for Fidel who knew Raul well, wrote later that his warm public exterior was a carefully maintained fa\u00e7ade; In private, he found him to be \"rough, curt, almost unpleasant\" with a dubious sense of humor.[62] Nevertheless though, Sanchez considered Raul the true \"architect\" of the Castroist system, despite having a polar opposite personality to Fidel. Whereas Fidel was \"charismatic, energetic, visionary but extremely impulsive and totally disorganized\", Raul was described as a \"natural, methodical, and uncompromising organizer\".[63]\nAfter a meeting with Pope Francis in Vatican City on 10 May 2015, Castro said that he would conditionally consider returning to the Roman Catholic Church.[64] He said in a televised news conference, \"I read all the speeches of the pope, his commentaries, and if the pope continues this way, I will go back to praying and go back to the [Roman Catholic] church. I am not joking.\"[48] The pope visited Cuba before his September 2015 visit to the United States. Castro said: \"I promise to go to all his Masses and with satisfaction,\" when Pope Francis visited Cuba in 2015.[65] Castro considered Christ a communist stating, \"I think that's why they killed Jesus, for being a communist, for doing what Fidel defined as revolution... changing the situation.\"[66]\n\nIn popular culture[edit]\nIn the 1969 American film Che!, Castro was played by Paul Bertoya. In the 2002 film Fidel, he was played by Maurice Comte. In the 2008 American biographical film Che, he was played by Rodrigo Santoro.\n\nHonours and awards[edit]\nHero of the Republic of Cuba\nJubilee Medal \"In Commemoration of the 100th Anniversary since the Birth of Vladimir Il'ich Lenin\" (USSR, 1970)\nOrder of the October Revolution (Soviet Union, 2 June 1981)\nOrder of the Holy Prince Daniel of Moscow, 1st class (Russian Orthodox Church, 19 October 2008)\u00a0\u2013 For the contribution to strengthening inter-religious cooperation in connection with the consecration of the church of Our Lady of Kazan in Havana\nOrder of Prince Yaroslav the Wise, 1st class (Ukraine, 26 March 2010)\nOrder of Lenin (USSR)\nGrand Collar of the Order of the Liberator (Venezuela)\nMedal of Friendship (People's Republic of China, 29 September 2019)\nReferences[edit]\nCitations[edit]\n\n\n^ Castro, Fidel (2007).
