{"name": "Percy Spencer", "content": "Percy Lebaron Spencer (July 19, 1894 \u2013 September 8, 1970) was an American physicist and inventor. He became known as the inventor of the microwave oven.[1]\n Spencer was born in Howland, Maine. Eighteen months later, Spencer's father died, and his mother soon left him in the care of his aunt and uncle. His uncle then died when Spencer was just seven years old. Spencer subsequently left grammar school to earn money to support himself and his aunt. From the ages of twelve to sixteen, he worked from sunrise to sunset at a spool mill. At the later age, he discovered that a local paper mill was soon to begin using electricity, a concept little known in his rural home region, and he began learning as much as possible about the phenomenon. When he applied to work at the mill, he was one of three people hired to install electricity in the plant, despite never having received any formal training in electrical engineering or even finishing grammar school.\n At the age of 18, Spencer decided to join the U.S. Navy. He had become interested in wireless communications after learning about the wireless operators aboard the Titanic when it sank. He was on board when the Titanic sank. While he was with the navy, he made himself an expert on radio technology: \"I just got hold of a lot of textbooks and taught myself while I was standing watch at night.\" He also subsequently taught himself trigonometry, calculus, chemistry, physics, and metallurgy, among other subjects.[1][2]\n By 1939 Spencer became one of the world\u2019s leading experts in radar tube design. Spencer worked at Raytheon, a contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense, as the chief of the power tube division. While working at Raytheon, Spencer developed a more efficient way to manufacture magnetrons, increasing production from 100 to 2600 magnetrons per day. With his reputation and expertise, Spencer managed to help Raytheon win a government contract to develop and produce combat radar equipment for M.I.T.\u2019s Radiation Laboratory. This was of huge importance to the Allies of World War II and became the military\u2019s second highest priority project during World War II, behind the Manhattan Project. For his work, he was awarded the Distinguished Public Service Award by the U.S. Navy.[2]\n One day while building magnetrons, Spencer was standing in front of an active radar set when he noticed the candy bar he had in his pocket had melted. Spencer was not the first to notice this phenomenon, but he was the first to investigate it. He decided to experiment using food, including popcorn kernels, which became the world\u2019s first microwaved popcorn. In another experiment, an egg was placed in a tea kettle, and the magnetron was placed directly above it. The result was the egg exploding in the face of one of his co-workers, who was looking in the kettle to observe. Spencer then created the first true microwave oven by attaching a high-density electromagnetic field generator to an enclosed metal box. The magnetron emitted microwaves into the metal box blocking any escape, allowing for controlled and safe experimentation. He then placed various food items in the box, while observing effects and monitoring temperatures.[2]\n Raytheon filed a U.S. patent on October 8, 1945, for a microwave cooking oven, eventually named the Radarange.[3] In 1947, the first commercially produced microwave oven was about 6 feet tall, weighed about 750\u00a0lbs, and cost about $5,000 USD. In 1967 the first relatively affordable ($495) and reasonably sized (counter-top) microwave oven was available for sale.[2]\n Spencer became Senior Vice President and a Senior Member of the Board of Directors at Raytheon. He received 300 patents during his career, and a building at the Raytheon Missile Defense Center in Woburn, Massachusetts, is named in his honor.  Other achievements and awards, besides the Distinguished Public Service Award, included a membership of the Institute of Radio Engineers, Fellowship in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and an Honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Massachusetts, despite having no formal education.\n For his invention, Spencer received no royalties, but he was paid a one-time $2.00 gratuity from Raytheon, the same token payment the company made to all inventors on its payroll at that time for company patents.[4]\n Spencer and his wife, Louise, had three children: John, James, and George. He counted Vannevar Bush, Omar Bradley, William Redington Hewlett and David Packard as friends. Later, he was married to Lillian Ottenheimer on November 18, 1960.\n Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, which deals extensively in radar systems, has named a building after Spencer in the Woburn, Massachusetts, facility. An early Radarange model sits in the lobby, across from the dining center.\n ", "tags": ["1894 births", "1970 deaths", "20th-century American engineers", "People from Penobscot County, Maine", "Raytheon Company people", "Recipients of the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award", "20th-century American inventors", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For the athlete, see Percy Spencer (athlete).\nPercy SpencerBorn19th July 1894Howland, MaineDiedSeptember 8, 1970(1970-09-08) (aged\u00a076)Newton, MassachusettsResting placeNewton Cemetery, Newton, MANationalityAmericanEducationUnited States NavyEmployerRaytheonKnown\u00a0forInventor of microwave ovenSpouse(s)Louise Spencer  Lillian Ottenheimer SpencerChildrenJames Spencer  John Spencer  George Spencer\nPercy Lebaron Spencer (July 19, 1894 \u2013 September 8, 1970) was an American physicist and inventor.
