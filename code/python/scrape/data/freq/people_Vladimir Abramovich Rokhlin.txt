His maternal grandmother, Clara Levenson, had been one of the first female doctors in Russia. His maternal grandfather Emmanuil Levenson was a wealthy businessman (he was also the illegitimate father of Korney Chukovsky, who was thus Henrietta's half-brother).  Vladimir Rokhlin's father Abram Veniaminovich Rokhlin was a well-known social democrat (he was imprisoned during Stalin's Great Purge, and executed in 1941).[3]\n Vladimir Rokhlin entered Moscow State University in 1935. His advisor was Abraham Plessner. He volunteered for the army in 1941, leading to four years as a prisoner of a German war camp. During this time he was able to hide his Jewish origins from the Nazis. Rokhlin was liberated by the Soviet military in January 1945. He then served as a German language translator for the 5th Army of the Belorussian front.  In May 1945 he was sent to a Soviet 'verification camp' for former prisoners of war. In January 1946 he was transferred to another camp to determine if he was an \"enemy of the Soviet.\" Rokhlin was cleared in June 1946 but was forced to remain in the camp as a guard. Due to intercession by mathematicians Andrey Kolmogorov and Lev Pontryagin, he was released in December 1946 and allowed to return to Moscow, after which he returned to mathematics.\n In 1959 Rokhlin joined Leningrad State University as a faculty member. He died in 1984 in Leningrad. His students include Viatcheslav Kharlamov, Yakov Eliashberg, Mikhail Gromov, Nikolai V. Ivanov, Anatoly Vershik and Oleg Viro.[4]\n Rokhlin's contributions to topology include Rokhlin's theorem, a result of 1952 on the signature of 4-manifolds. He also worked in the theory of characteristic classes, homotopy theory, cobordism theory, and in the topology of real algebraic varieties.\n In measure theory, Rokhlin introduced what are now called Rokhlin partitions. He introduced the notion of standard probability space, and characterised such spaces up to isomorphism mod\u00a00. He also proved the famous Rokhlin lemma.\n His son Vladimir Rokhlin, Jr. is a well-known mathematician and computer scientist at Yale University.\n Rokhlin's uncle was Korney Chukovsky, a well-known Russian poet, most famous for his popular children's books.\n ", "tags": ["1919 births", "1984 deaths", "20th-century Russian mathematicians", "Soviet mathematicians", "Jewish scientists", "Russian Jews", "Soviet prisoners of war", "Jewish concentration camp survivors", "Topologists", "Algebraic geometers", "Moscow State University alumni", "Scientists from Baku", "Saint Petersburg State University faculty", "Prisoners and detainees of the Soviet Union", "Use dmy dates from September 2020", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 Russian-language sources (ru)", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For other people named Vladimir Rokhlin, see Vladimir Rokhlin (disambiguation).\n\n\nVladimir Abramovich RokhlinVladimir Rokhlin in Leningrad, 1966.Born(1919-08-23)23 August 1919Baku, AzerbaijanDied3 December 1984(1984-12-03) (aged\u00a065)Leningrad, Soviet UnionCitizenshipCitizen of the Soviet UnionEducationMoscow State University (1935-1941)Known\u00a0forRokhlin lemmaRokhlin partitionsRokhlin's theoremChildrenVladimir Rokhlin, Jr.Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsLeningrad State UniversityAcademic advisorsAbraham PlessnerNotable studentsYakov EliashbergMikhail GromovNikolai V.
