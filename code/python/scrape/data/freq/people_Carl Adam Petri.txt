{"name": "Carl Adam Petri", "content": "Carl Adam Petri (12 July 1926 in Leipzig \u2013 2 July 2010 in Siegburg)[2][3] was a German mathematician and computer scientist.\n Petri created his major scientific contribution, the concept of the Petri net, in 1939 at the age of 13, for the purpose of describing chemical processes.[4] In 1941 his father told him about Konrad Zuse's work on computing machines and Carl Adam started building his own analog computer.\n After earning his Abitur at Thomasschule in 1944, he was drafted into the Wehrmacht. He was taken into British captivity until 1949, when he departed England.[5]\n Petri started studying mathematics at the Technischen Hochschule Hannover (today, the Leibniz University Hannover) in 1950. He documented the Petri net in 1962 as part of his dissertation, Kommunikation mit Automaten (communication with automata). He worked from 1959 until 1962 at the University of Bonn and received his PhD degree in 1962 from the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt. From 1963 to 1968 he established and directed the computing centre of Bonn University.[5] In 1968 he became head of Forschungsinstitut f\u00fcr Informationssysteme of the newly founded Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung (GMD). He retired in 1991.\n In 1988 Petri became honorary professor of the University of Hamburg.[6] He was a member of the Academia Europaea.\n Petri's work significantly advanced the fields of parallel computing and distributed computing, and it helped define the modern studies of complex systems and workflow management systems. His contributions have been in the broader area of network theory, which includes coordination models and theories of interaction, and eventually led to the formal study of software connectors.\n Petri was honored with the following awards:\n ", "tags": ["1926 births", "2010 deaths", "Scientists from Leipzig", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt alumni", "German computer scientists", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Werner von Siemens Ring laureates", "Formal methods people", "University of Bonn faculty", "University of Hamburg faculty", "Petri nets", "Members of Academia Europaea", "Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "Commanders of the Order of the Netherlands Lion", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Carl Adam PetriBorn(1926-07-12)12 July 1926Leipzig, Weimar RepublicDied2 July 2010(2010-07-02) (aged\u00a083)SiegburgAlma\u00a0materLeibniz University Hannover, Technische Universit\u00e4t DarmstadtKnown\u00a0forPetri netsAwardsCross of Merit, First class (1988)Konrad Zuse Medal (1993) Werner von Siemens Ring (1996) IEEE Computer Pioneer Award (2008)[1]Scientific careerFieldsMathematics, Computer scienceInstitutionsUniversity of Bonn\n\nCarl Adam Petri (12 July 1926 in Leipzig \u2013 2 July 2010 in Siegburg)[2][3] was a German mathematician and computer scientist.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and work\n2 Books, Papers, and Presentations\n3 Awards\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nLife and work[edit]\n Petri net example\nPetri created his major scientific contribution, the concept of the Petri net, in 1939 at the age of 13, for the purpose of describing chemical processes.[4] In 1941 his father told him about Konrad Zuse's work on computing machines and Carl Adam started building his own analog computer.\nAfter earning his Abitur at Thomasschule in 1944, he was drafted into the Wehrmacht.
