After operating a Mobil gas station and a failed backgammon club, Banerjee bought a failed Los Angeles club named \"Destiny II\" and turned it into a nightclub that featured female mud wrestling and a \"Female Exotic Dancing Night.\" The 1979 addition of a male stripper dance troupe performing to target female audiences was the first of its kind in the United States.
