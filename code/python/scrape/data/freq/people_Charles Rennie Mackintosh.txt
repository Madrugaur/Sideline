{"name": 0.0025188916876574307, "content": "\n Charles Rennie Mackintosh (7 June 1868 \u2013 10 December 1928) was a Scottish architect, designer, water colourist and artist. His artistic approach had much in common with European Symbolism. His work, alongside that of his wife Margaret Macdonald, was influential on European design movements such as Art Nouveau and Secessionism and praised by great modernists such as Josef Hoffmann. Mackintosh was born in Glasgow and died in London. He is among most important figures of Modern Style (British Art Nouveau style).\n Charles Rennie Mackintosh was born at 70 Parson Street, Townhead, Glasgow, on 7 June 1868, the fourth of eleven children and second son of William McIntosh, a superintendent and chief clerk of the City of Glasgow Police, and his wife, Margaret Rennie. Mackintosh grew up in the Townhead and Dennistoun (Firpark Terrace) areas of Glasgow,[1][2] and he attended Reid's Public School and the Allan Glen's Institution from 1880 to 1883.[3][4]\n In 1890 Mackintosh was the second winner of the Alexander Thomson Travelling Studentship, set up for the \"furtherance of the study of ancient classic architecture, with special reference to the principles illustrated in Mr. Thomson's works.\"\n He changed the spelling of his name from 'McIntosh' to 'Mackintosh' for unknown reasons, as his father did before him, around 1893.[5] Confusion continues to surround the use of his name with 'Rennie' sometimes incorrectly substituted for his first name of 'Charles'. The modern use of 'Rennie Mackintosh' as a surname is also incorrect and he was never known as such in his lifetime;[6] 'Rennie' being a middle name (his mother's maiden name) which he used often in writing his name. Signatures took various forms including 'C.R. Mackintosh' and 'Chas. R. Mackintosh.' The usage of \"Rennie Mackintosh\" to refer to him is therefore incorrect and he should instead be referred to as \"Charles Rennie Mackintosh\" or \"Mackintosh\".\n He worked with the Honeyman & Keppie architectural practice where he started his first major architectural project, the Glasgow Herald Building (now known as The Lighthouse), in 1899.  He was engaged to marry his employer's sister, Jessie Keppie.[7]\n Around 1892, Mackintosh met fellow artist Margaret Macdonald at the Glasgow School of Art. He and fellow student Herbert MacNair, also an apprentice at Honeyman and Keppie, were introduced to Margaret and her sister Frances MacDonald by the head of the Glasgow School of Art, Francis Henry Newbery, who saw similarities in their work.[7] Margaret and Charles married on 22 August 1900.[8] The couple had no children.[9] MacNair and Frances also married the previous year. The group worked collaboratively and came to be known as \"The Four\", and were prominent figures in Glasgow Style art and design. Mackintosh and Margaret married, setting up their first home in Mains Street on Blythswood Hill, the street later being renamed as Blythswood Street, Glasgow. Subsequently, they moved to Southpark Avenue, close to Glasgow University.\n In 1904, after he had completed several successful building designs, Mackintosh became a partner in Honeyman & Keppie, and the company became Honeyman, Keppie & Mackintosh. When economic hardships were causing many architectural practices to close, in 1913, he resigned from the partnership and attempted to open his own practice.\n Mackintosh lived most of his life in the city of Glasgow, located on the banks of the River Clyde. During the Industrial Revolution the city had one of the greatest production centres of heavy engineering and shipbuilding in the world. As the city grew and prospered, a faster response to the high demand for consumer goods and arts was necessary. Industrialized, mass-produced items started to gain popularity. Along with the Industrial Revolution, Asian style and emerging modernist ideas also influenced Mackintosh's designs. When the Japanese isolationist regime softened, they opened themselves to globalisation resulting in notable Japanese influence around the world. Glasgow's link with the eastern country became particularly close with shipyards at the River Clyde being exposed to Japanese navy and training engineers. Japanese design became more accessible and gained great popularity. In fact, it became so popular and so incessantly appropriated and reproduced by Western artists, that the Western world's fascination and preoccupation with Japanese art gave rise to the new term, Japonism or Japonisme.\n This style was admired by Mackintosh because of its restraint and economy of means rather than ostentatious accumulation; its simple forms and natural materials rather than elaboration and artifice; and its use of texture and light and shadow rather than pattern and ornament. In the old western style, furniture was seen as ornament that displayed the wealth of its owner; the value of the piece was established according to the length of time spent creating it. In the Japanese arts furniture and design focused on the quality of the space, which was meant to evoke a calming and organic feeling to the interior.\n At the same time a new philosophy concerned with creating functional and practical design was emerging throughout Europe: the so-called \"modernist ideas\". The main concept of the Modernist movement was to develop innovative ideas and new technology: design was concerned with the present and the future, rather than with history and tradition. Heavy ornamentation and inherited styles were discarded. Even though Mackintosh became known as the 'pioneer' of the movement, his designs were far removed from the bleak utilitarianism of Modernism. His concern was to build around the needs of people: people seen, not as masses, but as individuals who needed not a machine for living in but a work of art.  Mackintosh took his inspiration from his Scottish upbringing and blended them with the flourish of Art Nouveau and the simplicity of Japanese forms.\n While working in architecture, Charles Rennie Mackintosh developed his own style: a contrast between strong right angles and floral-inspired decorative motifs with subtle curves (for example, the Mackintosh Rose motif), along with some references to traditional Scottish architecture. The project that helped make his international reputation was the Glasgow School of Art (1897\u20131909). During the early stages of the Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh also completed the Queen's Cross Church project in Maryhill, Glasgow. This is considered to be one of Mackintosh's most mysterious projects. It is the only church by the Glasgow-born artist to be built and is now the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society headquarters.\nLike his contemporary Frank Lloyd Wright, Mackintosh's architectural designs often included extensive specifications for the detailing, decoration, and furnishing of his buildings. The majority, if not all, of this detailing and significant contributions to his architectural drawings were designed and detailed by his wife Margaret Macdonald[10] whom Charles had met when they both attended the Glasgow School of Art. Their work was shown at the eighth Vienna Secession Exhibition in 1900.\nMackintosh's architectural career was a relatively short one, but of significant quality and impact. All his major commissions were between 1895[11] and 1906,[12] including designs for private homes, commercial buildings, interior renovations and churches.\n Although moderately popular (for a period) in his native Scotland, most of Mackintosh's more ambitious designs were not built. Designs for various buildings for the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition were not constructed,[13] neither was his \"Haus eines Kunstfreundes\" (Art Lover's House) of the same year. He competed in the 1903 design competition for Liverpool Cathedral, but failed to gain a place on the shortlist[14] (the winner was Giles Gilbert Scott).\n Other unbuilt Mackintosh designs include:\n The House for An Art Lover (1901) was built in Bellahouston Park, Glasgow after his death (1989\u20131996).[15]\n An Artist's Cottage and Studio (1901),[16] known as The Artist's Cottage, was completed at Farr by Inverness in 1992.  The architect was Robert Hamilton Macintyre acting for Dr and Mrs Peter Tovell.[17][18] Illustrations can be found on the RCAHMS Canmore site.[19]\n The first of the unexecuted Gate Lodge, Auchinbothie (1901) sketches[20] was realised as a mirrored pair of gatehouses to either side of the Achnabechan[21] and The Artist's Cottage drives, also at Farr by Inverness.  Known as North House and South House, these were completed 1995\u20137.[22][23]\n Mackintosh's architectural output was small, but he did influence European design. Popular in Austria and Germany, his work received acclaim when it was shown at the Vienna Secession Exhibition in 1900. It was also exhibited in Budapest, Munich, Dresden, Venice and Moscow.\n Mackintosh, his future wife Margaret MacDonald, her sister Frances MacDonald, and Herbert MacNair met at evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art (see above). They became known as a collaborative group, \"The Four\", or \"The Glasgow Four\", and were prominent members of the \"Glasgow School\" movement.[24] The group exhibited in Glasgow, London and Vienna, and these exhibitions helped establish Mackintosh's reputation. The so-called \"Glasgow\" style was exhibited in Europe and influenced the Viennese Art Nouveau movement known as Sezessionstil (in English, the Vienna Secession) around 1900.  Mackintosh also worked in interior design, furniture, textiles and metalwork. Much of this work combines Mackintosh's own designs with those of his wife, whose flowing, floral style complemented his more formal, rectilinear work. Blackie commissioned him in the 1920s to work on bindings for their publications. One of these works was an abstract design that was intended for a new uniform of G. A. Henty's novels. It was instead used for Yarns on the Beach by Henty,[25] and for a series entitled The Boys and Girls Bookshelf, c. 1926.[26] Both Newbolt and Floyer speculate that Mackintosh may have designed the cover for another series by Blackie.[25][26]\n Later in life, disillusioned with architecture, Mackintosh worked largely as a watercolourist, painting numerous landscapes and flower studies (often in collaboration with Margaret, with whose style Mackintosh's own gradually converged).  They moved to the Suffolk village of Walberswick in 1914. There Mackintosh was suspected of being a German spy and briefly arrested in 1915 during World War I.[27]\n By 1923, the Mackintoshes had moved to Port Vendres,[28] a Mediterranean coastal town in southern France with a warm climate that was a comparably cheaper location in which to live. Mackintosh had entirely abandoned architecture and design and concentrated on watercolour painting. He was interested in the relationships between man-made and naturally occurring landscapes and created a large portfolio of architecture and landscape watercolour paintings.  Many of his paintings depict Port Vendres, a small port near the Spanish border, and the landscapes of Roussillon. The local Charles Rennie Mackintosh Trail details his time in Port Vendres and shows the paintings and their locations.[29] The couple remained in France for two years, before being forced to return to London in 1927 due to illness.\n That year, Charles Rennie Mackintosh was diagnosed with tongue cancer and throat cancer.  This is clearly described in the letters he was writing to his wife from France. A brief recovery prompted him to leave the hospital and convalesce at home for a few months.  Mackintosh was admitted to a nursing home where he died on 10 December 1928 at the age of 60. He was cremated the next day at Golders Green Crematorium in London. His ashes were scattered, in accordance with his wishes, over the Mediterranean at Port Vendres from one of the rocks he had painted.[30][31]\n Mackintosh's designs gained in popularity in the decades following his death. His House for an Art Lover was built in Glasgow's Bellahouston Park in 1996, and the University of Glasgow (which owns most of his watercolour work) rebuilt the interior of a terraced house Mackintosh had designed, and furnished it with his and Margaret's work (it is part of the university's Hunterian Museum).\n The Glasgow School of Art building (now \"The Mackintosh Building\") is cited by architectural critics as among the finest buildings in the UK. On 23 May 2014 the building was ravaged by fire. The library was destroyed, but firefighters managed to save the rest of the building.[32] On 15 June 2018, about a year before completion of the restoration of the building the School was again struck by fire. This second fire caused catastrophic damage, effectively destroying all the interiors and leaving the outer walls so structurally unstable that large sections of them had to be taken down to prevent uncontrolled collapse. Such was the global concern that a public commitment to faithfully rebuild The Mackintosh Building was made post-fire by then Director of The Glasgow School of Art, Tom Inns.\n The Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society encourages greater awareness of the work of Mackintosh as an architect, artist and designer. The rediscovery of Mackintosh as a significant figure in design has been attributed to the designation of Glasgow as European City of Culture in 1990,[33] and exhibition of his work which accompanied the year-long festival. His enduring popularity since has been fuelled by further exhibitions and books and memorabilia which have illustrated aspects of his life and work. The revival of public interest has led to the refurbishment and opening of more buildings to the public, such as the Willow Tea Rooms in Glasgow and 78 Derngate in Northampton.  From the 1990s onwards the Scottish artist Stewart Bowman Johnson, who studied in the Mackintosh building at Glasgow School of Art, produced a series of interpretations of the architect's work including works depicting the doors and windows of the Willow tearooms.\n The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City held a major retrospective exhibition of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's works from 21 November 1996 to 16 February 1997. In conjunction with the exhibit were lectures and a symposium by scholars, including Pamela Robertson of the Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow art gallery owner Roger Billcliffe, and architect J. Stewart Johnson, and screening of documentary films about Mackintosh.[34]\n Charles Rennie Mackintosh was commemorated on a series of banknotes issued by the Clydesdale Bank in 2009; his image appeared on an issue of \u00a3100 notes.[35]\n In 2012, one of the largest collections of art by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow Four Glasgow School was sold at auction in Edinburgh for \u00a31.3m. The sale included work by Mackintosh's sister-in-law Frances Macdonald and her husband Herbert MacNair.[36]\n In July 2015 it was announced that Mackintosh's designs for a tearoom would be reconstructed to form a display in Dundee's new V&A museum. Although the original building which housed the tearoom on Glasgow's Ingram Street was demolished in 1971 the interiors had all been dismantled and put into storage.[37] The restored \"Oak Room\" was revealed when V&A Dundee opened to the public on 15 September 2018.\n In June 2018, a mural depicting Mackintosh and using elements of his iconic style was created in Glasgow to honour the 150th anniversary of the artist's birth.[38] It is made by Glasgow street artist, Rogue One and commissioned by the Radisson Red.\n From 1986 until 1992, InterCity locomotive 86226 was named Charles Rennie Mackintosh. In March 2018, Virgin Trains West Coast named 390008 Charles Rennie Mackintosh.[39]\n <-- More of a book designer than an illustrator in fact -->\n ", "tags": ["Charles Rennie Mackintosh buildings", "1868 births", "1928 deaths", "People from Townhead", "People of the Victorian era", "Art Nouveau architects", "Art Nouveau designers", "Art Nouveau painters", "Arts and Crafts movement artists", "Scottish architects", "19th-century Scottish painters", "Scottish male painters", "20th-century Scottish painters", "Alumni of the Glasgow School of Art", "People educated at Allan Glen's School", "Scottish watercolourists", "Botanical illustrators", "Glasgow School", "Scottish furniture designers", "Golders Green Crematorium", "Architects from Glasgow", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Use British English from August 2014", "Use dmy dates from November 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with AGSA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NGV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For the chemist and inventor, see Charles Macintosh.\n\n\nCharles Rennie MackintoshBornCharles Rennie McIntosh(1868-06-07)7 June 1868Townhead, GlasgowDied10 December 1928(1928-12-10) (aged\u00a060)NationalityScottishEducationGlasgow School of ArtKnown\u00a0forArchitecture, Art, Design, Decorative ArtsNotable workGlasgow School of Art, The Willow Tearooms, Hill House, Queen's Cross Church, Scotland Street SchoolStyleSymbolism, Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau, Glasgow StyleMovementGlasgow Style, Art Nouveau, SymbolismSpouse(s)Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh\nCharles Rennie Mackintosh (7 June 1868 \u2013 10 December 1928) was a Scottish architect, designer, water colourist and artist.

Although the original building which housed the tearoom on Glasgow's Ingram Street was demolished in 1971 the interiors had all been dismantled and put into storage.[37] The restored \"Oak Room\" was revealed when V&A Dundee opened to the public on 15 September 2018.\nIn June 2018, a mural depicting Mackintosh and using elements of his iconic style was created in Glasgow to honour the 150th anniversary of the artist's birth.[38] It is made by Glasgow street artist, Rogue One and commissioned by the Radisson Red.\nFrom 1986 until 1992, InterCity locomotive 86226 was named Charles Rennie Mackintosh. In March 2018, Virgin Trains West Coast named 390008 Charles Rennie Mackintosh.[39]\n\nSee also[edit]\nThe English House\nPeople on Scottish banknotes\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ James Steele; Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1994).
