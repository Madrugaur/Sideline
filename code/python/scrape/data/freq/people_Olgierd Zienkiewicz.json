{"name": "Olgierd Zienkiewicz", "content": "\n Olgierd Cecil Zienkiewicz CBE FRS FREng (18 May 1921 \u2013  2 January 2009)[1][2] was a British academic of Polish descent, mathematician, and civil engineer. He was born in Caterham, England. He was one of the early pioneers of the finite element method.[3] Since his first paper in 1947 dealing with numerical approximation to the stress analysis of dams, he published nearly 600 papers and wrote or edited more than 25 books.[4]\n His school education took place in Poland, where his father was a judge of the Katowice district. He and his family moved to the UK due to World War II.\nZienkiewicz studied in the early 1940s at Imperial College London for an undergraduate BSc (Hons) degree in civil engineering which he obtained in 1943 with first class honours. Then, after being offered a scholarship, he stayed for two more years at Imperial College to carry out research on dams under the supervision of Professors Alfred Pippard and Sir Richard V. Southwell. He was awarded the PhD degree in 1945 with his thesis title \"Classical theories of gravity dam design in the light of modern analytical methods\".\n Zienkiewicz was notable for having recognized the general potential for using the finite element method to resolve problems in areas outside the area of solid mechanics. The idea behind finite elements design is to develop tools based in computational mechanics schemes that can be useful to designers, not solely for research purposes. His books on the Finite Element Method were the first to present the subject and to this day remain the standard reference texts. He also founded the first journal dealing with computational mechanics in 1968 (International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering), which is still the major journal for the field of Numerical Computations.[4]\n The international range of Zienkiewicz' academic experiences has been geographically diverse. He became a lecturer at the Department of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, UK (1949\u20131957) before becoming Professor of Structural and Civil Engineering at Northwestern University, Illinois, USA (1957\u20131961). From 1961 to 1988 he was Head of the Department of Civil Engineering at Swansea University. He was latterly Professor Emeritus of this institution. Other teaching positions have included:\n Zienkiewicz received over 30[5] honorary degrees from Ireland, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, China, Poland, Scotland, Wales, France, England, Italy, Portugal, Hungary and the United States.[4]\n He was elected to a number of learned societies,[4] including:\n He has been the recipient of many honours, awards, and medals.[4] including\n He was instrumental in setting up the  association of computational mechanics in engineering (ACME) for the United Kingdom in 1992 and was the honorary president for the association for the rest of his life.\n The Institution of Civil Engineers awards a prize in his honour biennially. The Zienkiewicz Numerical Methods in Engineering Prize was instituted in 1998 following a donation by John Wiley & Sons Ltd to commemorate his work in Numerical Methods in Engineering.\n ", "tags": ["IStructE Gold Medal winners", "1921 births", "2009 deaths", "English people of Polish descent", "Numerical analysts", "Alumni of Imperial College London", "Academics of Swansea University", "People associated with the finite element method", "Commanders of the Order of the British Empire", "Foreign members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Polish Academy of Sciences", "Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Royal Medal winners", "People from Caterham", "Academics of the University of Edinburgh", "Northwestern University faculty", "University of Texas at Austin faculty", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Engineering", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from December 2016", "Use British English from December 2016", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "British academic of Polish descent, mathematician and civil engineer\n\n\nOlgierd ZienkiewiczBorn(1921-05-18)18 May 1921Caterham, UKDied2 January 2009(2009-01-02) (aged\u00a087)Swansea, UKNationalityPolish-BritishEducationImperial CollegeOccupationEngineerEngineering careerDisciplineCivil engineer, Structural engineerInstitutionsInstitution of Civil Engineers, Institution of Structural EngineersSignificant advanceFinite element method in structural mechanicsAwardsIStructE Gold MedalRoyal Medal (1990)Timoshenko Medal (1998)\n\nOlgierd Cecil Zienkiewicz CBE FRS FREng (18 May 1921 \u2013  2 January 2009)[1][2] was a British academic of Polish descent, mathematician, and civil engineer.
