In the summer of\u00a01937, after defending his D.Sc.,\n\n\u2026together with I.\u00a0Chashnikov he makes a first climb to the Chotchi summit, and with K.\u00a0Piskaryov performs a climb of Bu-Ul'gen via the western wall (one of the first wall climbs in the history of the Soviet alpinism).[\u2026] In\u00a01940\u00a0 he participates in a record-making traversal[\u2026] He manages, almost by a miracle, to stop the fall of\u00a0A.\u00a0Gromov, who had fallen along with a snow shelf. It was with this traversal that Aleksandrov completed the alpinist sports master requirements. The German-Soviet War postponed awarding him this honorary title until\u00a01949.\n(See A.D.\u00a0Aleksandrov in the mountains (an alpinist biography), Savvon\u00a0S.M., [1], p.182\u2013183)\nDuring his rectorship, Aleksandrov also advanced the mountaineering sport activities in the university, actively participating in the climbs.\nThe fiftieth birthday was celebrated by Aleksandrov in the mountains with his friends. On that day he made a solo first climb of an\n\n\u2026unnamed peak 6222\u00a0m (Shakhdarinsk ridge, Pamir), that as he suggested was then named \"The peak of the Leningrad university.\"\nDuring later years Aleksandrov didn't undertake climbs due to health problems, yet he never ceased dreaming of climbs.
