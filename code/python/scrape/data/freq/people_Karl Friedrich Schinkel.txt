{"name": "Karl Friedrich Schinkel", "content": "\n Karl Friedrich Schinkel (13 March 1781 \u2013 9 October 1841) was a Prussian architect, city planner, and painter who also designed furniture and stage sets. Schinkel was one of the most prominent architects of Germany and designed both neoclassical and neogothic buildings.[1] His most famous buildings are found in and around Berlin.\n Schinkel was born in Neuruppin, Margraviate of Brandenburg. When he was six, his father died in the disastrous Neuruppin fire of 1787. He became a student of architect Friedrich Gilly (1772\u20131800) (the two became close friends) and his father, David Gilly, in Berlin. After returning to Berlin from his first trip to Italy in 1805, he started to earn his living as a painter. When he saw Caspar David Friedrich's painting Wanderer above the Sea of Fog at the 1810 Berlin art exhibition he decided that he would never reach such mastery of painting and turned to architecture.[citation needed] Working for the stage, in 1816 he created a star-spangled backdrop for the appearance of the \"K\u00f6nigin der Nacht\" in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera The Magic Flute, which is even quoted in modern productions of this perennial piece. After Napoleon's defeat, Schinkel oversaw the Prussian Building Commission. In this position, he was not only responsible for reshaping the still relatively unspectacular city of Berlin into a representative capital for Prussia, but also oversaw projects in the expanded Prussian territories from the Rhineland in the west to K\u00f6nigsberg in the east, such as New Altstadt Church.[2]\n From 1808 to 1817 Schinkel renovated and reconstructed Schloss Rosenau, Coburg, in the Gothic Revival style.[3] He also rebuilt the ruins of Chorin Abbey.\n His portrait appeared on the German 1000 Reichsmark banknote issued in 1936.[4] It was valid until the issue of the Deutsche Mark on 21 June 1948 after WW2.\n Schinkel's style, in his most productive period, is defined by a turn to Greek rather than Imperial Roman architecture, an attempt to turn away from the style that was linked to the recent French occupiers. (Thus, he is a noted proponent of the Greek Revival.) He believed that in order to avoid sterility and have a soul, a building must contain elements of the poetic and the past, and have a discourse with them.[5][6]\n His most famous extant buildings are found in and around Berlin. These include the Neue Wache (1816\u20131818), the National Monument for the Liberation Wars (1818\u20131821), the Schauspielhaus (1819\u20131821) at the Gendarmenmarkt, which replaced the earlier theatre that was destroyed by fire in 1817, and the Altes Museum on Museum Island (1823\u20131830). He also carried out improvements to the Crown Prince's Palace and to Schloss Charlottenburg. Schinkel was also responsible for the interior decoration of a number of private Berlin residences. Although the buildings themselves have long been destroyed, portions of a stairwell from the Weydinger House were able to be rescued and built into the Nicolaihaus on Br\u00fcderstr. and its formal dining hall into the Palais am Festungsgraben.[2]\n Between 1825\u20131827, he collaborated with Carl Theodor Ottmer on designs for the Berliner Singakademie for Sing-Akademie zu Berlin. Since 1952, it has been known as the Maxim Gorki Theatre.[7]\n Later, Schinkel moved away from classicism altogether, embracing the Neo-Gothic in his Friedrichswerder Church (1824\u20131831). Schinkel's Bauakademie (1832\u20131836), his most innovative building, eschewed historicist conventions and seemed to point the way to a clean-lined \"modernist\" architecture that would become prominent in Germany only toward the beginning of the 20th century.\n Schinkel died in Berlin, Province of Brandenburg.\n Schinkel, however, is noted as much for his theoretical work and his architectural drafts as for the relatively few buildings that were actually executed to his designs. Some of his merits are best shown in his unexecuted plans for the transformation of the Athenian Acropolis into a royal palace for the new Kingdom of Greece and for the erection of the Orianda Palace in the Crimea. These and other designs may be studied in his Sammlung architektonischer Entw\u00fcrfe (1820\u20131837) and his Werke der h\u00f6heren Baukunst (1840\u20131842; 1845\u20131846). He also designed the famed Iron Cross medal of Prussia, and later Germany.\n It has been speculated, however, that due to the difficult political circumstances \u2013 French occupation and the dependency on the Prussian king \u2013 and his relatively early death, which prevented him from seeing the explosive German industrialization in the second half of the 19th century, he was not able to live up to the true potential exhibited by his sketches.\n Gothic Cathedral by a River, 1813\n View of Mont Blanc, 1813\n Morning, 1813\n Karl Friedrich Schinkel's stage set for Mozart's Magic Flute, 1815\n Medieval City on a River, 1815\n Rock Arch, 1818\n Uranus and the Dance of the Stars, 1834\n Christian Peter Wilhelm Beuth, 1837 (Allegory of Prussia's industrial renewal)\n Konzerthaus, Berlin\n Altes Museum\n Friedrichswerdersche Kirche\n Potsdam Nikolaikirche\n Alexander Nevsky chapel, Peterhof, Russia\n Schloss Stolzenfels\n ", "tags": ["1781 births", "1841 deaths", "19th-century architects", "19th-century German architects", "German ecclesiastical architects", "German neoclassical painters", "Greek Revival architects", "Neoclassical architects", "People from Neuruppin", "People from the Margraviate of Brandenburg", "Articles with German-language sources (de)", "Use dmy dates from August 2020", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2018", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nPrussian architect, city planner and painter\nKarl Friedrich SchinkelSchinkel in 1836: by Carl Joseph BegasBorn(1781-03-13)13 March 1781Neuruppin, Margraviate of BrandenburgDied9 October 1841(1841-10-09) (aged\u00a060)Berlin, Province of BrandenburgNationalityGermanOccupationarchitect, city plannerKnown\u00a0forneoclassical and neogothic buildings\nKarl Friedrich Schinkel (13 March 1781 \u2013 9 October 1841) was a Prussian architect, city planner, and painter who also designed furniture and stage sets.
