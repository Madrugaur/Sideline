{"name": "Amar Bose", "content": "\n Amar Gopal Bose (/bo\u028az/; November 2, 1929 \u2013 July 12, 2013) was an American entrepreneur and academic. An electrical engineer and sound engineer, he was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for over 45 years.[1] He was also the founder and chairman of Bose Corporation.\n In 2011, he donated a majority of the company to MIT in the form of non-voting shares to sustain and advance MIT's education and research mission.[2]\n Bose was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,[3] to a Bengali Hindu father, Noni Gopal Bose and an American mother of French and German ancestry, Charlotte. His father was an Indian freedom revolutionary[4] who, having been imprisoned for his political activities, fled Bengal in the 1920s in order to avoid further persecution by the British colonial police.[5] His mother, Charlotte, is described as an American schoolteacher of French and German ancestry,[6] but Bose described her as \"more Bengali than I\". She was a vegetarian and deeply interested in Vedanta and Hindu philosophy.[7]\n Bose first displayed his entrepreneurial skills and his interest in electronics at age thirteen when, during the World War II years, he enlisted school friends as co-workers in a small home business repairing model trains and home radios, to supplement his family's income.[8]\n After graduating from Abington Senior High School in Abington, Pennsylvania, Bose enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating with a BS (Bachelor of Science) in Electrical Engineering in the early 1950s. Bose spent a year at Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium in Eindhoven, Netherlands; and a year as a Fulbright research student in New Delhi, India, where he met his future first wife. He completed his PhD in Electrical Engineering from MIT, writing a thesis on non-linear systems under the supervision of Norbert Wiener and Yuk-Wing Lee.\n Following graduation, Amar Bose became an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During his early years as a professor, Bose bought a high-end stereo speaker system in 1956 and he was disappointed to find that speakers with impressive technical specifications failed to reproduce the realism of a live performance. This would eventually motivate his extensive speaker technology research, concentrating on key weaknesses in the high-end speaker systems available at the time. His research on acoustics led him to develop a stereo loudspeaker that would reproduce, in a domestic setting, the dominantly reflected sound field that characterizes the listening space of the audience in a concert hall. His focus on psychoacoustics  later became a hallmark of his company's audio products.\n For initial capital to fund his company in 1964, Bose turned to angel investors, including his MIT thesis advisor and professor, Y. W. Lee. Bose was awarded significant patents in two fields that continue to be important to the Bose Corporation. These patents were in the area of loudspeaker design and non-linear, two-state modulated, Class-D power processing.\n In the 1980s, Bose developed an electromagnetic replacement for automotive shock absorbers, intended to radically improve the performance of automotive suspension systems, absorbing bumps and road shock while controlling car body motions and sway.[9]\n In 2007, Amar Bose was listed in Forbes 400 as the 271st richest man in the world, with a net worth of $1.8 billion.[10] In 2009, he was no longer on the billionaires list, but returned to the list in 2011, with a net worth of $1.0 billion.[11]\n The company Bose founded employed 11,700 people worldwide as of 2016[update] and produces products for home, car, and professional audio, as well as conducting basic research in acoustics and other fields. Bose never took his company public, and since the company is privately held Bose was able to pursue risky long-term research. In a 2004 interview in Popular Science magazine, he said: \"I would have been fired a hundred times at a company run by MBAs. But I never went into business to make money. I went into business so that I could do interesting things that hadn't been done before.\"[9]\n Bose said that his best ideas usually came to him in a flash. \"These innovations are not the result of rational thought; it's an intuitive idea.\"[12]\n He married Prema Bose but they later divorced.[when?] They had two children, Vanu and Maya.  He had one grandchild, Kamala. Amar Bose did not practice any religion, though he used to meditate for a short while every day.[13] Vanu Bose was the founder and CEO of a software-defined radio technology company.[14]\n Bose died on July 12, 2013 at the age of 83 in Wayland, Massachusetts.[1][15][16]\n In addition to running his company, Bose remained a professor at MIT until 2001. He earned the Baker Teaching Award in 1963\u201364, and further teaching awards over the years.  The Bose Award for Excellence in Teaching (1989), and later the Junior Bose Award (1995) were established in his honor, to recognize outstanding teaching in the MIT School of Engineering.[17] Former students have stated that his classes helped them gain life skills and problem solving skills that have served them throughout their careers.[1]\n In 2011, Bose donated a majority of the company's non-voting shares to MIT on the condition that the shares never be sold.[18] Because these shares are non-voting, MIT does not participate in operations or governance of Bose Corporation.[17]\n ", "tags": ["1929 births", "2013 deaths", "20th-century American inventors", "American acoustical engineers", "American audio engineers", "American billionaires", "American electrical engineers", "American Hindus", "American people of Bengali descent", "American people of French descent", "American people of German descent", "Analog electronics engineers", "Bose Corporation", "Businesspeople from Massachusetts", "American businesspeople of Indian descent", "MIT School of Engineering faculty", "MIT School of Engineering alumni", "Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering", "Businesspeople from Philadelphia", "Fellow Members of the IEEE", "Engineers from Pennsylvania", "20th-century American businesspeople", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "Use American English from June 2015", "All Wikipedia articles written in American English", "Use mdy dates from June 2015", "Infobox person using certain parameters when dead", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016", "All articles containing potentially dated statements", "All articles with vague or ambiguous time", "Vague or ambiguous time from April 2014", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article is about the American engineer and founding chairman of Bose Corporation.
