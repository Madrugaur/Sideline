{"name": "Harriet Pollatsek", "content": "Harriet Suzanne Katcher Pollatsek (born Harriet Katcher, May 2, 1942) is an American mathematician and Professor Emeritus of Mathematics [1]  at Mount Holyoke College.[2]\n Born to a Jewish family[3] in Detroit, Michigan, Pollatsek entered the honors program at University of Michigan in 1959, the first person in her family to attend college.[2] She earned a BA in mathematics in 1963 and her PhD in 1967 under the direction of Jack E. McLaughlin.[4]\nAfter graduating she held short-term teaching positions at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, the University of Toledo, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.[5]\n Following this, she joined the faculty at Mount Holyoke  College in 1970,[5] and earned tenure there in 1974.\nIn 1990 she was named the Julia and Sarah Ann Adams Professor of Science at Mount Holyoke College.\nShe was dean of studies from 1977 to 1980.\nOn sabbatical leaves, she has also been a visiting professor at the University of Oregon.\n Pollatsek's research interests include finite groups, finite geometries, Lie theory, difference sets and their application to error correcting codes and coding theory.\n With Emily H. Moore, she is the author of the book Difference Sets: Connecting Algebra, Combinatorics, and Geometry (Student Mathematical Library 67, American Mathematical Society, 2013).[6]\n She has been active in developing new methods of teaching mathematics, particularly in developing a new method of teaching calculus called calculus in context. This method embeds calculus concepts in specific questions from various sciences and then goes to the abstract and generalized concepts.\n She has worked on summer mathematical research with undergraduates under the NSF program Research Experiences for Undergraduates.\n In 2007 Pollatsek was presented with the Mount Holyoke College Faculty Prize for Teaching.[7]\n ", "tags": ["1942 births", "Living people", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts alumni", "Mount Holyoke College faculty", "People from Detroit", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nHarriet Suzanne Katcher Pollatsek (born Harriet Katcher, May 2, 1942) is an American mathematician and Professor Emeritus of Mathematics [1]  at Mount Holyoke College.[2]\n\nEducation and career[edit]\nBorn to a Jewish family[3] in Detroit, Michigan, Pollatsek entered the honors program at University of Michigan in 1959, the first person in her family to attend college.[2] She earned a BA in mathematics in 1963 and her PhD in 1967 under the direction of Jack E.
