One was to create a new fa\u00e7ade for the church of Saint John Lateran, and another was for a public fountain at Trevi. The former completion was won by Alessandro Galilei, though Salvi\u2019s design had much praise. Salvi\u2019s design for the fountain however was chosen instead of plans by Ferdinando Fuga and his friend Luigi Vanvitelli.
