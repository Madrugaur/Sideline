They were married until his death.[4]  He continued in dancing despite the loss of a leg in 1979.[5]\n In 1960 he was appointed Head of the Department of Chemical Engineering at University College Swansea, where he remained till his retirement in 1987.[2]\nIn 1969 he was awarded the Arnold Greene Medal of the Institution of Chemical Engineers, and he was its President from 1975 to 1976.[2] He was also a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.[3] He was awarded the OBE in the 1981 New Year Honours List for services to industry via his work on various government and other committees.[3]\n Richardson died on 4 January 2011.[6][7]\n A full list was published in Chemical Engineering Research and Design in 2006.[8]\n Richardson's first paper was on the fire hazards of liquid methane[9] and further papers on fire hazards followed until 1952 when he began to move into multi-phase flow (particularly gas\u2013liquid flows) and rheology which became his main focus: his research was honoured in two issues of Chemical Engineering Research and Design.[2][3]\n He co-wrote a textbook on chemical engineering with John Coulson (published in 1954), which developed into an established series of six texts now known as Coulson & Richardson's Chemical Engineering.  (He and Coulson were largely responsible for the contents of the first two volumes: they were editors but not prime authors for the rest of the series of six volumes.)
