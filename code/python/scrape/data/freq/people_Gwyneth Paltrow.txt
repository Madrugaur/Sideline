She garnered wider acclaim for her performance as Viola de Lesseps in the historical romance film Shakespeare in Love (1998) which won her several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actress. This performance was followed by roles in The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), Shallow Hal (2001), and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004).\n After becoming a mother, Paltrow significantly reduced her film workload. She made occasional appearances in films, such as Proof (2005), for which she earned a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. In 2009, Paltrow received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Spoken Word Album for Children for the children's audiobook Brown Bear and Friends. She won an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her guest role as Holly Holliday on the Fox musical comedy-drama television series Glee in 2011. From 2008 to 2019, Paltrow portrayed Pepper Potts in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n Beginning in 1995, Paltrow has been the face of Est\u00e9e Lauder's Pleasures perfume. She is also the face of American fashion brand Coach,[2] owner of a lifestyle company, Goop, and author of several cookbooks.\n Gwyneth Kate Paltrow was born on September 27, 1972, in Los Angeles, to actress Blythe Danner and film producer-director Bruce Paltrow.[3] She has a younger brother, Jake, who is a director and screenwriter.[4] Paltrow's father was Jewish,[5] while her mother is from a Christian background.[6] She was raised celebrating \"both Jewish and Christian holidays.\"[7] Her brother had a traditional bar mitzvah when he turned 13.[8][9] Her father's Ashkenazi Jewish family emigrated from Belarus and Poland,[10][11][12][13][14] while her mother has Pennsylvania Dutch (German) as well as some Irish and English ancestry.[15][16][17] Paltrow's paternal great-great-grandfather was a rabbi in Nowogr\u00f3d, Poland, and a descendant of the well-known Paltrowicz family of rabbis from Krak\u00f3w.[18][19] She is a half-cousin of actress Katherine Moennig, through her mother, and a second cousin of former U.S. Congresswoman Gabby Giffords (AZ-08) through her father. Through Giffords, she is a second-cousin-in-law of U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona.[20] Her godfather is director Steven Spielberg.[21][22][23] Her uncle is opera singer and actor Harry Danner, whose daughter, actress Hillary Danner,[24] is Paltrow's cousin and close friend. Paltrow recalls their family gatherings: \"Hillary and I always had this in common, and to this day [...] cooking for people we love, eating, hanging out as a family. It's how we were raised. It's what we do.\"[25] Another cousin is Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, whose spouse is the Israeli-American millionaire Adam Neumann, founder of WeWork.\n Paltrow was raised in Santa Monica, California, where she attended Crossroads School, before enrolling in the Fieldston School, a private school in New York City.[26]  Later, she briefly studied anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, before dropping out to  act.[27] She is an \"adopted daughter\" of Talavera de la Reina (Spain), where at 15, she spent a year as an exchange student and learned to speak Spanish.[28][29][30] She is also conversant in French, as her family frequently traveled to the South of France throughout her childhood.[31][32]\n Her acting debut was in High (1989), a TV film her father directed, and after spending several summers watching her mother perform at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts, Paltrow made her professional stage debut there in 1990.[33] Her film debut followed with the musical romance film Shout (1991), starring John Travolta, and she was cast by Steven Spielberg in the commercially successful adventure feature Hook (1991) as the young Wendy Darling.[33] Paltrow's next roles were in one episode of the Scottish soap opera Take The High Road (1992) and the made-for-television movies Cruel Doubt (1992) and Deadly Relations (1993). \n Her first plum feature film role was in the noir drama Flesh and Bone (1993) as the much-younger girlfriend of James Caan. Janet Maslin of The New York Times described Paltrow as a scene-stealer \"who is Blythe Danner's daughter and has her mother's way of making a camera fall in love with her.\"[34]\n In 1995, she starred in the thriller Se7en, as the wife of a young detective (Brad Pitt), who is partnered with the retiring William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and then tasked with tracking down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as tropes in his murders. The seventh-highest-grossing film of the year,[35] Seven also earned her a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. She appeared in Moonlight and Valentino, as a grieving chain-smoker, and in Jefferson in Paris, portraying Martha Jefferson Randolph.[36][37]\n In 1996, Paltrow played the title character in the period film adaptation Emma, based on the 1815 novel of the same name by Jane Austen. Director Douglas McGrath decided to bring in Paltrow to audition for the part of Emma Woodhouse, after a suggestion from his agent and after seeing her performance in Flesh and Bone.[38] On his decision to cast the actress, McGrath revealed: \"The thing that actually sold me on her playing a young English girl was that she did a perfect Texas accent. I know that wouldn't recommend her to most people [...] I knew she had theater training, so she could carry herself. We had many actresses, big and small, who wanted to play this part. The minute she started the read-through, the very first line, I thought, 'Everything is going to be fine; she's going to be brilliant.'\"[38] While she recovered from wisdom-tooth surgery, Paltrow had a month to herself to do her own research for the part;[39] she studied horsemanship, dancing, singing, archery and the \"highly stylized\" manners and dialect during a 3-week rehearsal period.[39] The film was released to critical acclaim and commercial success through arthouse cinemas.[40] Variety proclaimed: \"Gwyneth Paltrow shines brightly as Jane Austen's most endearing character, the disastrously self-assured matchmaker Emma Woodhouse. A fine cast, speedy pacing and playful direction make this a solid contender for the Austen sweepstakes.\"[41] Paltrow starred in the crime film Hard Eight.[42]\n 1998 marked a turning point in Paltrow's career as she took on leading roles in five high-profile film releases in the year\u2014Great Expectations, Sliding Doors, Hush, A Perfect Murder and Shakespeare in Love. In the adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations, also starring Ethan Hawke, Robert De Niro, Anne Bancroft and Chris Cooper, she played the unrequited and haughty childhood love of a New York City painter. The British drama Sliding Doors saw her star as a woman whose life could take two central paths depending on whether or not she catches a train, causing different outcomes. Great Expectations and Sliding Doors both grossed over $55\u00a0million worldwide.[43][44] Paltrow starred opposite Jessica Lange in the thriller Hush, as an unsuspecting woman living with her psychotic mother-in-law. The film made $13.5\u00a0million domestically and was generally panned by critics.[45][46] In another thriller, A Perfect Murder, inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film, Dial M for Murder, Paltrow starred alongside Michael Douglas, playing Emily Taylor, who was based on Grace Kelly's character from the original film. Despite a mixed critical response towards A Perfect Murder, the film grossed $128\u00a0million globally.[47] She was also considered for the role of Rose DeWitt Bukater in the 1997 film Titanic.[48]\n Her most critically acclaimed role in the year was that of the fictional lover of William Shakespeare in Shakespeare in Love, opposite Joseph Fiennes in the titular part. Entertainment Weekly commented, \"Best of all is Gwyneth Paltrow, who, at long last, has a movie to star in that's as radiant as she is.\"[49] The New York Times summed up her performance as Viola thus: \"Gwyneth Paltrow, in her first great, fully realized starring performance, makes a heroine so breathtaking that she seems utterly plausible as the playwright's guiding light.\"[50] Shakespeare in Love made $289\u00a0million in box office receipts,[51][52] and won Paltrow the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role,[53] Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Comedy or Musical,[53] and Academy Award for Best Actress, among other honors.[52] The pink Ralph Lauren dress she wore to the 71st Academy Awards in collecting her Oscar was extremely popular and was credited for bringing pink back into fashion.[54]\n In 1999, Paltrow co-starred alongside Jude Law, Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett in the psychological thriller The Talented Mr. Ripley, as the fianc\u00e9e of a rich and spoiled millionaire playboy (Law) whose identity is adopted by a con artist (Damon). While The Guardian, noting the \"very underwritten\" female roles in the story, found her to be \"peaky and pallid\",[55] the film received positive reviews and grossed $80\u00a0million in North America.[56] She showcased her singing ability in 2000s Duets, which was directed by her father and co-starred singer Huey Lewis. In the film, about \"the little known world of karaoke competitions and the wayward characters who inhabit it\", she portrayed the estranged daughter of a hustler (Lewis). She performed a cover version of Smokey Robinson's \"Cruisin', which was released as a single and went to number one in Australia, while her rendition of the Kim Carnes classic \"Bette Davis Eyes\" reached number three.[57] Also in 2000, Paltrow co-starred with Ben Affleck in the moderately successful romantic drama Bounce as Abby Janello.\n She starred with Jack Black in the comedy Shallow Hal (2001), about a shallow man falling in love with an overweight woman. To play her role, she had to wear a specially designed 25-pound fatsuit and heavy makeup. Shallow Hal opened with $22.5\u00a0million and grossed $70.7\u00a0million in North America and $141.1\u00a0million around the globe.[58] Roger Ebert remarked that she was \"truly touching\" in the film, which he described as \"often very funny, but [...] also surprisingly moving at times.\"[59] In the Wes Anderson dramedy The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), co-starring Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson, Paltrow took on the role of the adopted daughter in an estranged family of former child prodigies reuniting with their father. A positive critical response greeted the film upon its release, and it made $71.4\u00a0million worldwide.[60]\n In 2004, it was noted that since her Oscar win for Shakespeare in Love, Paltrow's film career had been less noteworthy and critical acclaim had waned.[61] She said she was unequipped for the pressure, leading to several bad film choices,[62] agreeing with peers who believe the win is, in some ways, a curse.[63] During this time, Paltrow rarely appeared in films, having taken a hiatus to raise her two children.[26] In The Guardian, she said she divided her career into movies for love and films for money: The Royal Tenenbaums, Proof, and Sylvia fell into the former category, while she signed on to View from the Top and Shallow Hal for the latter.[30]\n In 2002, Paltrow made small appearances in the documentary Searching for Debra Winger and the action satire comedy Austin Powers in Goldmember, while she starred in the thriller-drama Possession with Aaron Eckhart as a couple of literary scholars who unearth the amorous secret of two Victorian poets as they find themselves falling under a deepening connection. The film made a lukewarm $14.8\u00a0million worldwide.[64] In the following year, she headlined the romantic comedy View from the Top, where she obtained the part of woman from a small town who sets out to fulfill her dream of becoming a flight attendant. Budgeted at $30\u00a0million, the film only earned $7\u00a0million in its opening weekend; it eventually grossed $15.6 domestically and $19,526,014 worldwide.[65] She herself later disparaged the film, calling it \"terrible\".[66] Paltrow starred as the titular role in Sylvia (2003), a British biographical drama directed by Christine Jeffs and co-starring Daniel Craig chronicling the romance between prominent poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Distributed for a limited release in most markets, Sylvia made $2.9\u00a0million internationally.[67] The New York Times, in its review for the film, wrote that \"her performance goes well beyond mimicry. She has a vivid, passionate presence, even when her lively features have gone slack with depression and her bright blue eyes have glazed over.\"[68]\n In 2004, she starred with her The Talented Mr. Ripley co-star Jude Law and Angelina Jolie in the science fiction film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Her role in the film was Polly Perkins, the reporter for the fictional New York Chronicle. Law became one of the producers of the film and used his clout to get Paltrow involved. Once she had been suggested for the role, Law did not remember \"any other name coming up. It just seems that she was perfect. She was as enthusiastic about the script and about the visual references that were sort of put to her, and jumped on board.\"[69] She said in an interview, \"I thought that this is the time to do a movie like this where it's kind of breaking into new territory and it's not your basic formulaic action-adventure movie.\"[69] While critical response was positive, with a budget of $70\u00a0million, Sky Captain only grossed $58\u00a0million at the international box office.[70] Also in 2004, she was recognized as an outstanding woman in entertainment by Women in Film Los Angeles with the Crystal Award.[71]\n In the drama Proof (2005), she starred as the depressed daughter of a brilliant, eccentric mathematician (played by Anthony Hopkins). The film was based on the play of the same name, in which Paltrow also played the same character at London's Donmar Warehouse between May and June 2002. On her portrayal in the film version, Eye for Film remarked: \"As she has already shown in Sylvia, The Royal Tenenbaums and even Sliding Doors, Paltrow has an uncanny talent for playing women who are coming apart at the seams and her [character] veers from lovably eccentric to more disturbingly unhinged and back again with fluent ease. The scenes, which she and Hopkins share, as two difficult people bound together by affection, dependency and mutual respect, are entirely believable and all the more touching for it.\"[72] For her performance, Paltrow received her second Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama.\n Paltrow filmed small roles for the 2006 films Love and Other Disasters, Running with Scissors and Infamous, where she sang Cole Porter's \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" Her brother Jake Paltrow directed her in his feature debut, the romantic comedy The Good Night (2007), in which she starred opposite Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Martin Freeman, Danny DeVito and Simon Pegg as the wife of a former keyboard player (Freeman). The film received a two-theater run in North America and garnered mixed reviews from critics.[73] View London felt the actress was \"clearly only playing her part as a courtesy to her director brother and it just makes you wish she'd go back to playing lead roles again.\"[74]\n Paltrow saw a resurgence in her career in 2008, when she was cast in Iron Man as Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's personal assistant, closest friend, and budding love interest.[75] First hesitant to appear in a big-budget project, Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics they would consider relevant to her understanding of the character, whom she considered to be very smart, levelheaded, and grounded. She said she liked \"the fact that there's a sexuality that's not blatant.\" The director Jon Favreau wanted Potts and Stark's relationship to be reminiscent of a 1940s screwball comedy, something which Paltrow considered to be fun in an \"innocent yet sexy\" way.[76] Iron Man was favorably received by critics, and with a worldwide gross of $585\u00a0million, it became Paltrow's highest-grossing film until The Avengers (2012).[77] She reprised her role in the sequels Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013). While the second film grossed $623.9\u00a0million internationally,[78] the third entry went on to gross $1.215\u00a0billion.[79] She also reprised the role in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).\n Paltrow starred opposite Joaquin Phoenix in the romantic drama Two Lovers (2008), playing the beautiful but volatile new neighbor of a depressed bachelor. Two Lovers premiered in competition at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival in May, receiving largely positive reviews,[80][81] especially for Paltrow's  and Phoenix's performances; Los Angeles Times felt that \"Phoenix is at his best with Paltrow's bruised sparrow of a girl; he's desperate to take care of her when he can't even take care of himself. She is one of those actresses who understands the power of a look, and the one of regret and then resignation that overtakes her when Leonard professes his love is steeped in sadness.\"[82] The film was an arthouse success, grossing $16\u00a0million worldwide.[83]\n In the musical drama Country Strong (2010), she starred as an emotionally unstable country music star who attempts to resurrect her career. She recorded the song \"Country Strong\" for the film's soundtrack,[84] and it was released to country radio stations in August 2010.[85] The film received mediocre reviews and grossed a modest $20.2\u00a0million in North America.[86] The consensus of review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes was: \"The cast gives it their all, and Paltrow handles her songs with aplomb, but Country Strong's clich\u00e9d, disjointed screenplay hits too many bum notes.\"[87] At the 83rd Academy Awards, Paltrow performed another song from the film, \"Coming Home,\" which was nominated for Best Original Song.[88]\n Paltrow made her first scripted television appearance[89] on Fox's Glee, as substitute teacher Holly Holliday, who fills in for Matthew Morrison's character when he falls ill. Her role was developed by co-creator Ryan Murphy, a personal friend of Paltrow's, who suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing abilities ahead of the release of Country Strong.[90] In her first episode, \"The Substitute,\" she sang \"Nowadays\" from the musical Chicago with Lea Michele, CeeLo Green's \"Forget You\", and a mash-up of \"Singin' In the Rain\" and Rihanna's \"Umbrella\" with Morrison and the rest of the cast.[91] Her debut on Glee attracted significant buzz and positive commentary from critics; she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.[92] Indeed, at the time, Entertainment Weekly's Tim Stack and E! Online's Kristin dos Santos called her appearance Emmy-worthy, with the former rating it among her best performances, and the latter stating that Holly received \"some of Glee's best-ever one-liners.\"[93][94]\n She later performed \"Forget You\" with CeeLo Green himself and several puppet characters provided by The Jim Henson Company at the 2011 Grammy Awards.[95] She reprised her role twice more that season, performing \"Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)\" by Gary Glitter, an acoustic version of \"Landslide\" by Fleetwood Mac, \"Kiss\" by Prince, and Adele's \"Turning Tables.\" Paltrow was briefly featured in Glee: The 3D Concert Movie after being filmed while she performed \"Forget You\" as Holly in the 2011 Glee Live! In Concert! tour performances of June 16 and 17, 2011.[96] Later that year, Paltrow appeared in Steven Soderbergh's film Contagion, featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Marion Cotillard, Kate Winslet and her The Talented Mr. Ripley co-stars Matt Damon and Jude Law. The thriller follows the rapid progress of a lethal indirect contact transmission virus that kills within days.[97] Paltrow played Elizabeth Emhoff, a \"working mom\" and one of the virus' first victims.[98] Contagion received positive reviews and opened atop at the North American box office with $23.1\u00a0million; it went on to gross $75.6\u00a0million domestically and $135.4\u00a0million worldwide.[99]\n She reprised her role of Pepper Potts in The Avengers (2012), which set numerous box office records, including the biggest opening weekend in North America; it grossed over $1.5\u00a0billion worldwide, becoming Paltrow's most widely seen film.[100] Also in 2012, she starred in the independent romantic dramedy Thanks for Sharing, opposite Mark Ruffalo as people learning to face a challenging and confusing road as they struggle together against sex addiction. Distributed for a limited release in certain parts of the United States, the film garnered mixed reviews and grossed $1\u00a0million domestically.[101] Paste magazine noted that her role \"exhibits some of the same obsessive diet and exercise habits that Paltrow herself has been accused of\u2014a kind of meta character trait that balances the power in [the main roles'] budding relationship.\"[102] In April 2013, Paltrow was named People magazine's annual \"Most Beautiful Woman.\"[103]\n In 2014, she had a two-episode arc in the improvised online series Web Therapy, as Maya Ganesh, \"a new-age caricature.\"[104] In 2015, she starred in Mortdecai,[105] alongside Johnny Depp, Olivia Munn, and Paul Bettany. In it, she portrayed the wife of an unscrupulous art dealer and swindler (Depp). Budgeted at $60\u00a0million, the film only grossed $7.7\u00a0million in North America and $47.3\u00a0million internationally.[106] Paltrow was featured on the track \"Everglow\", which was included in Coldplay's seventh studio album A Head Full of Dreams (2015).[107] In June 2017, Paltrow announced that she would take a break from acting to focus on her business Goop, stating: \"I'm still going to do a little bit here and there, but [the company] really requires almost all of my time.\"[108]\n In 2019, Paltrow reprised her role as Pepper Potts in Avengers: Endgame.[109] That same year, she played a supporting role in the Netflix comedy-drama series The Politician, playing the mother of Ben Platt's character.[110]\n Paltrow is a Save the Children artist ambassador, raising awareness about World Pneumonia Day.[111] She is on the board of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization that works to alleviate poverty in New York City.[112] In October 2014, she hosted a Democratic fundraiser attended by President Barack Obama at her private residence in Los Angeles.[113]\n In May 2019, Paltrow and actor Bradley Whitford hosted a fundraiser for Democratic presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg.[114]\n In April 2020, Paltrow, along with other celebrities, discussed the COVID-19 pandemic with Dr. Anthony Fauci on a one-hour-long zoom call. Fauci hoped the celebrities would use their social media \"megaphones\" to encourage proper precautions among their followers.[115][116]\n In 2009, Paltrow narrated the audiobook The Brown Bear & Friends by Bill Martin Jr., the first of a series of children's audiobooks that she narrated. The Brown Bear & Friends audiobook earned Paltrow a Grammy Award nomination for Best Spoken Word Album for Children.[117] Since, she has also narrated Bill Martin's Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?, Baby Bear, Baby Bear, What Do You See?, Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See?, and Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?.[118]\n In May 2005, Paltrow became the face of Est\u00e9e Lauder's Pleasures perfume. She appeared in Chicago on August 17, 2007, to sign bottles of the perfume, and on July 8, 2008, she promoted Lauder's Sensuous perfume in New York with the company's three other models.[119] Est\u00e9e Lauder donates a minimum of $500,000 of sales of items from the 'Pleasures Gwyneth Paltrow' collection to breast cancer research.[120] In 2006, she became the face for Bean Pole International, a Korean fashion brand and in 2014, she partnered with Blo Blow Bar, teaming up with the brand's creative branch.[121]\n In September 2008, Paltrow launched the weekly lifestyle newsletter Goop, encouraging readers to 'nourish the inner aspect'.[122] Goop has expanded into a web-based company, Goop.com. According to Paltrow, the company's name came from someone telling her successful internet companies have double O's in their name,[123] and \"is a nickname, like my name is G.P., so that is really where it came from. And I wanted it to be a word that means nothing and could mean anything.\"[124] Goop has expanded into e-commerce, collaborating with fashion brands, launching pop-up shops,[125] launching a wellness summit,[126] a print magazine,[127] a podcast,[128] and a documentary series streamed on Netflix.[129]\n Goop, and by extension Paltrow, have faced backlash for showcasing expensive products[130] and promoting medically and scientifically impossible treatments, many of which have harmful consequences. The controversies have included vaginal steaming,[131] the use of jade eggs,[132][133] a dangerous coffee enema device,[134][135] and \"Body Vibes\", wearable stickers that were claimed to \"rebalance the energy frequency in our bodies\" and which Goop falsely claimed were made of a NASA-developed material.[136][137] Goop settled a lawsuit regarding the health claims it made over the jade eggs.[138]\n Jill Avery, a brand analyst, has noted how Goop's response to criticism seems designed to \"strengthen their brand and draw their customers closer\", noting Goop's references to feminism, traditional Asian medicines and Eastern philosophies, and anti-establishment politics to do so.[139]\n On January 24, 2020, Netflix released The Goop Lab, a documentary series. The 6-part show promotes Goop, and covers pseudoscientific topics in energy healing, the use of psychedelic drugs, cold therapy, anti-aging, mediumship, and female sexuality.[140][141][142] Critics argued that granting Goop access to Netflix's platform was a \"win for pseudoscience\".[143][144][145] Upon release of the first trailer, and again after the full six-episode series was available, the series sparked controversy concerning the medical and scientific misinformation it presented.[146][147][148][149][150]\n On January 27, 2020, Truth in Advertising watchdog (TINA.org) filed a complaint with the district attorneys of California alleging that Goop has continued to engage in deceptive marketing.[151] TINA.org's complaint alleges that Goop claims their products are \"clinically-proven\" to treat such symptoms as anxiety, depression, OCD and more.\n In October 2007, Paltrow signed for the PBS television series Spain... on the Road Again, which showcases the food and culture of Spain.[152] In 2008, Paltrow co-wrote the book Spain... A Culinary Road Trip with Mario Batali.[153] In 2011, she wrote a book titled My Father's Daughter: Delicious, Easy Recipes Celebrating Family and Togetherness.[154] That same year she penned the book Notes From the Kitchen Table.[155] Two years later she published a book titled It's All Good: Delicious Easy Recipes That Will Make You Look Good and Feel Great, which promoted an elimination diet that is unsupported by medical evidence.[156] Included in that book was a recipe for avocado toast which was widely copied and adapted as part of a 2010s food trend.[157] Also in 2013, Paltrow wrote a foreword for a book by Ross Matthews, Man Up! Tales of My Delusional Self-Confidence. In 2016, Paltrow published a cookbook: It's All Easy: Delicious Weekday Recipes for the Super-Busy Home Cook.[158]\n Negative reaction by a group of scientist and science communication mothers to Paltrow's 2015 video pushing for mandatory labeling of food containing genetically modified organisms led to the creation of a documentary, Science Moms. The film is about mothers who advocate for science-based decision-making concerning the health and nutrition of children.[159]\n In February 2021 it was reported that Paltrow was suffering from long COVID, leaving her with \"some long-tail fatigue and brain fog\". She advocated treatments for it which involved a \"ketogenic and plant-based\" diet (with no sugar or alcohol), fasting until 11:00 every day and taking infrared saunas. This advice was criticized by national medical director for England Professor Stephen Powis.[160]\n At age 24, Paltrow was engaged to actor Brad Pitt, whom she dated from 1994 to 1997.[28] They called off the engagement, according to Paltrow, because she was not ready for marriage.[161] Paltrow has since said that, as this was her first high-profile relationship with another celebrity, it taught her the need for public discretion about her romantic life.[162]\n Paltrow had an on-and-off three-year relationship with actor Ben Affleck from 1997 to late 2000.[163] They first split in early 1999; soon afterward, Paltrow persuaded Affleck to star in the film Bounce with her.[164] During the making of the film, the couple started dating again and eventually broke up in October 2000.\n In October 2002, Paltrow met Chris Martin of the British band Coldplay backstage three weeks after the death of her father, Bruce Paltrow. They married in December 2003 in a ceremony at a hotel in Southern California. Paltrow was pregnant with Martin's child at the time of their wedding.[165] Paltrow and Martin have two children together: daughter Apple, born in May 2004,[166][167] and a son Moses, born in April 2006.[168][169] Moses' name was inspired by a song Chris Martin wrote for Paltrow. Simon Pegg and Martin's bandmate Jonny Buckland are Apple's godfathers.[170]\n Paltrow cut down on work after becoming a mother.[171] She also suffered from postpartum depression after the 2006 birth of her son.[172] In March 2014, Paltrow announced that she and Martin had separated after ten years of marriage, describing the process as \"conscious uncoupling.\"[173][174][175] In her official announcement, Paltrow had her doctor, Dr. Habib Sadeghi, and his dentist wife, Dr. Sherry Sami, explain Conscious Uncoupling. A \"conscious uncoupling is the ability to understand that every irritation and argument [within a marriage] was a signal to look inside ourselves and identify a negative internal object that needed healing,\" Sadeghi explained. \"From this perspective, there are no bad guys, just two people, it's about people as individuals, not just the relationship\".[176]\n In 2014, Paltrow whose father was Jewish and mother is not, was reportedly planning to convert to Judaism,[6][13][177][178]\n In April 2015, Paltrow filed for divorce,[179] which was finalized on July 14, 2016.[180]\n In 2014, Paltrow began dating producer Brad Falchuk, whom she met on the set of Glee in 2010. The couple went public with their relationship in April 2015.[181] They announced their engagement on January 8, 2018[182] and the following July, that they would have a \"private and small\" wedding.[183][184]\nThe marriage ceremony was held in September 2018 in The Hamptons on Long Island, New York.

She confided in her then-fianc\u00e9 Brad Pitt, who confronted the producer at an industry event. Weinstein later warned Paltrow not to tell anyone else.[188] Paltrow was, in 2017, a major source for an article written by The New York Times investigative journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey about Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct.[189]\n In January 2019, retired optometrist Terry Sanderson sued Paltrow for $3.1\u00a0million, claiming that three years earlier she collided with him on a ski slope at Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah, causing him permanent traumatic brain injury.[190] Paltrow counter-sued Sanderson in February, claiming that he was the one who crashed into her. She sought a symbolic $1 in damages, as well as repayment of her legal fees.[191][192]\n Paltrow has received backlash from the scientific community and medical professionals for promoting unproven treatments based on pseudoscience through her company Goop.[193][194]\n ", "tags": ["Gwyneth Paltrow", "1972 births", "20th-century American actresses", "21st-century American actresses", "21st-century American non-fiction writers", "21st-century American singers", "21st-century American women singers", "21st-century American women writers", "Actresses from Los Angeles", "Actresses from Santa Monica, California", "Actresses of British descent", "Actresses of Irish descent", "Actresses of German descent", "Alternative detoxification promoters", "American cookbook writers", "American country singer-songwriters", "American expatriates in the United Kingdom", "American female country singers", "American film actresses", "American food writers", "American people of Barbadian descent", "American people of Belarusian-Jewish descent", "American people of English descent", "American people of Irish descent", "American people of Pennsylvania Dutch descent", "American people of Polish-Jewish descent", "American stage actresses", "American television actresses", "American women non-fiction writers", "Ashkenazi Jews", "Best Actress Academy Award winners", "Best Musical or Comedy Actress Golden Globe (film) winners", "California Democrats", "Country musicians from California", "Country musicians from New York (state)", "Crossroads School alumni", "Living people", "New York (state) Democrats", "Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Screen Actors Guild Award winners", "Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role Screen Actors Guild Award winners", "Pseudoscientific diet advocates", "Singers from California", "Songwriters from California", "Spence School alumni", "University of California, Santa Barbara alumni", "Women cookbook writers", "Women food writers", "Writers from Los Angeles", "American web series actresses", "American voice actresses", "Audiobook narrators", "Paltrow family", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with failed verification", "Articles with failed verification from August 2017", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use American English from February 2021", "All Wikipedia articles written in American English", "Use mdy dates from February 2021", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2013", "All articles containing potentially dated statements", "Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American actress\n\n\nGwyneth PaltrowPaltrow at the 2011 Venice Film FestivalBornGwyneth Kate Paltrow (1972-09-27) September 27, 1972 (age\u00a048)Los Angeles, California, U.S.Other\u00a0namesGwyneth Paltrow Martin[1]EducationUniversity of California, Santa BarbaraOccupationActressmodelentrepreneurwriterbusinesswomanauthorYears\u00a0active1989\u2013presentSpouse(s)Chris Martin\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a02003; div.\u00a02016)\u200bBrad Falchuk \u200b(m.\u00a02018)\u200bChildren2Parent(s)Bruce PaltrowBlythe DannerRelativesJake Paltrow (brother)Harry Danner (uncle)Katherine Moennig (cousin)Rebekah Neumann (cousin)Gabby Giffords (second cousin)\nGwyneth Kate Paltrow (/\u02c8p\u00e6ltro\u028a/; born (1972-09-27)September 27, 1972) is an American actress, model, writer, entrepreneur, businesswoman and author.

Through Giffords, she is a second-cousin-in-law of U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona.[20] Her godfather is director Steven Spielberg.[21][22][23] Her uncle is opera singer and actor Harry Danner, whose daughter, actress Hillary Danner,[24] is Paltrow's cousin and close friend. Paltrow recalls their family gatherings: \"Hillary and I always had this in common, and to this day [...] cooking for people we love, eating, hanging out as a family. It's how we were raised. It's what we do.\"[25] Another cousin is Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, whose spouse is the Israeli-American millionaire Adam Neumann, founder of WeWork.\nPaltrow was raised in Santa Monica, California, where she attended Crossroads School, before enrolling in the Fieldston School, a private school in New York City.[26]  Later, she briefly studied anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, before dropping out to  act.[27] She is an \"adopted daughter\" of Talavera de la Reina (Spain), where at 15, she spent a year as an exchange student and learned to speak Spanish.[28][29][30] She is also conversant in French, as her family frequently traveled to the South of France throughout her childhood.[31][32]\n\nCareer[edit]\n1989\u20131995: Early work[edit]\nHer acting debut was in High (1989), a TV film her father directed, and after spending several summers watching her mother perform at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts, Paltrow made her professional stage debut there in 1990.[33] Her film debut followed with the musical romance film Shout (1991), starring John Travolta, and she was cast by Steven Spielberg in the commercially successful adventure feature Hook (1991) as the young Wendy Darling.[33] Paltrow's next roles were in one episode of the Scottish soap opera Take The High Road (1992) and the made-for-television movies Cruel Doubt (1992) and Deadly Relations (1993). \nHer first plum feature film role was in the noir drama Flesh and Bone (1993) as the much-younger girlfriend of James Caan. Janet Maslin of The New York Times described Paltrow as a scene-stealer \"who is Blythe Danner's daughter and has her mother's way of making a camera fall in love with her.\"[34]\nIn 1995, she starred in the thriller Se7en, as the wife of a young detective (Brad Pitt), who is partnered with the retiring William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and then tasked with tracking down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as tropes in his murders. The seventh-highest-grossing film of the year,[35] Seven also earned her a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. She appeared in Moonlight and Valentino, as a grieving chain-smoker, and in Jefferson in Paris, portraying Martha Jefferson Randolph.[36][37]\n\n1996\u20132001: Emma and film stardom[edit]\nIn 1996, Paltrow played the title character in the period film adaptation Emma, based on the 1815 novel of the same name by Jane Austen. Director Douglas McGrath decided to bring in Paltrow to audition for the part of Emma Woodhouse, after a suggestion from his agent and after seeing her performance in Flesh and Bone.[38] On his decision to cast the actress, McGrath revealed: \"The thing that actually sold me on her playing a young English girl was that she did a perfect Texas accent. I know that wouldn't recommend her to most people [...] I knew she had theater training, so she could carry herself. We had many actresses, big and small, who wanted to play this part. The minute she started the read-through, the very first line, I thought, 'Everything is going to be fine; she's going to be brilliant.'\"[38] While she recovered from wisdom-tooth surgery, Paltrow had a month to herself to do her own research for the part;[39] she studied horsemanship, dancing, singing, archery and the \"highly stylized\" manners and dialect during a 3-week rehearsal period.[39] The film was released to critical acclaim and commercial success through arthouse cinemas.[40] Variety proclaimed: \"Gwyneth Paltrow shines brightly as Jane Austen's most endearing character, the disastrously self-assured matchmaker Emma Woodhouse. A fine cast, speedy pacing and playful direction make this a solid contender for the Austen sweepstakes.\"[41] Paltrow starred in the crime film Hard Eight.[42]\n1998 marked a turning point in Paltrow's career as she took on leading roles in five high-profile film releases in the year\u2014Great Expectations, Sliding Doors, Hush, A Perfect Murder and Shakespeare in Love. In the adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations, also starring Ethan Hawke, Robert De Niro, Anne Bancroft and Chris Cooper, she played the unrequited and haughty childhood love of a New York City painter. The British drama Sliding Doors saw her star as a woman whose life could take two central paths depending on whether or not she catches a train, causing different outcomes. Great Expectations and Sliding Doors both grossed over $55\u00a0million worldwide.[43][44] Paltrow starred opposite Jessica Lange in the thriller Hush, as an unsuspecting woman living with her psychotic mother-in-law. The film made $13.5\u00a0million domestically and was generally panned by critics.[45][46] In another thriller, A Perfect Murder, inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film, Dial M for Murder, Paltrow starred alongside Michael Douglas, playing Emily Taylor, who was based on Grace Kelly's character from the original film. Despite a mixed critical response towards A Perfect Murder, the film grossed $128\u00a0million globally.[47] She was also considered for the role of Rose DeWitt Bukater in the 1997 film Titanic.[48]\n\n Paltrow at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival\nHer most critically acclaimed role in the year was that of the fictional lover of William Shakespeare in Shakespeare in Love, opposite Joseph Fiennes in the titular part. Entertainment Weekly commented, \"Best of all is Gwyneth Paltrow, who, at long last, has a movie to star in that's as radiant as she is.\"[49] The New York Times summed up her performance as Viola thus: \"Gwyneth Paltrow, in her first great, fully realized starring performance, makes a heroine so breathtaking that she seems utterly plausible as the playwright's guiding light.\"[50] Shakespeare in Love made $289\u00a0million in box office receipts,[51][52] and won Paltrow the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role,[53] Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Comedy or Musical,[53] and Academy Award for Best Actress, among other honors.[52] The pink Ralph Lauren dress she wore to the 71st Academy Awards in collecting her Oscar was extremely popular and was credited for bringing pink back into fashion.[54]\nIn 1999, Paltrow co-starred alongside Jude Law, Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett in the psychological thriller The Talented Mr. Ripley, as the fianc\u00e9e of a rich and spoiled millionaire playboy (Law) whose identity is adopted by a con artist (Damon). While The Guardian, noting the \"very underwritten\" female roles in the story, found her to be \"peaky and pallid\",[55] the film received positive reviews and grossed $80\u00a0million in North America.[56] She showcased her singing ability in 2000s Duets, which was directed by her father and co-starred singer Huey Lewis. In the film, about \"the little known world of karaoke competitions and the wayward characters who inhabit it\", she portrayed the estranged daughter of a hustler (Lewis). She performed a cover version of Smokey Robinson's \"Cruisin', which was released as a single and went to number one in Australia, while her rendition of the Kim Carnes classic \"Bette Davis Eyes\" reached number three.[57] Also in 2000, Paltrow co-starred with Ben Affleck in the moderately successful romantic drama Bounce as Abby Janello.\nShe starred with Jack Black in the comedy Shallow Hal (2001), about a shallow man falling in love with an overweight woman. To play her role, she had to wear a specially designed 25-pound fatsuit and heavy makeup. Shallow Hal opened with $22.5\u00a0million and grossed $70.7\u00a0million in North America and $141.1\u00a0million around the globe.[58] Roger Ebert remarked that she was \"truly touching\" in the film, which he described as \"often very funny, but [...] also surprisingly moving at times.\"[59] In the Wes Anderson dramedy The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), co-starring Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson, Paltrow took on the role of the adopted daughter in an estranged family of former child prodigies reuniting with their father. A positive critical response greeted the film upon its release, and it made $71.4\u00a0million worldwide.[60]\n\n2002\u20132007: Mixed critical work and hiatus[edit]\nIn 2004, it was noted that since her Oscar win for Shakespeare in Love, Paltrow's film career had been less noteworthy and critical acclaim had waned.[61] She said she was unequipped for the pressure, leading to several bad film choices,[62] agreeing with peers who believe the win is, in some ways, a curse.[63] During this time, Paltrow rarely appeared in films, having taken a hiatus to raise her two children.[26] In The Guardian, she said she divided her career into movies for love and films for money: The Royal Tenenbaums, Proof, and Sylvia fell into the former category, while she signed on to View from the Top and Shallow Hal for the latter.[30]\nIn 2002, Paltrow made small appearances in the documentary Searching for Debra Winger and the action satire comedy Austin Powers in Goldmember, while she starred in the thriller-drama Possession with Aaron Eckhart as a couple of literary scholars who unearth the amorous secret of two Victorian poets as they find themselves falling under a deepening connection. The film made a lukewarm $14.8\u00a0million worldwide.[64] In the following year, she headlined the romantic comedy View from the Top, where she obtained the part of woman from a small town who sets out to fulfill her dream of becoming a flight attendant. Budgeted at $30\u00a0million, the film only earned $7\u00a0million in its opening weekend; it eventually grossed $15.6 domestically and $19,526,014 worldwide.[65] She herself later disparaged the film, calling it \"terrible\".[66] Paltrow starred as the titular role in Sylvia (2003), a British biographical drama directed by Christine Jeffs and co-starring Daniel Craig chronicling the romance between prominent poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Distributed for a limited release in most markets, Sylvia made $2.9\u00a0million internationally.[67] The New York Times, in its review for the film, wrote that \"her performance goes well beyond mimicry. She has a vivid, passionate presence, even when her lively features have gone slack with depression and her bright blue eyes have glazed over.\"[68]\nIn 2004, she starred with her The Talented Mr. Ripley co-star Jude Law and Angelina Jolie in the science fiction film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Her role in the film was Polly Perkins, the reporter for the fictional New York Chronicle. Law became one of the producers of the film and used his clout to get Paltrow involved. Once she had been suggested for the role, Law did not remember \"any other name coming up. It just seems that she was perfect. She was as enthusiastic about the script and about the visual references that were sort of put to her, and jumped on board.\"[69] She said in an interview, \"I thought that this is the time to do a movie like this where it's kind of breaking into new territory and it's not your basic formulaic action-adventure movie.\"[69] While critical response was positive, with a budget of $70\u00a0million, Sky Captain only grossed $58\u00a0million at the international box office.[70] Also in 2004, she was recognized as an outstanding woman in entertainment by Women in Film Los Angeles with the Crystal Award.[71]\nIn the drama Proof (2005), she starred as the depressed daughter of a brilliant, eccentric mathematician (played by Anthony Hopkins). The film was based on the play of the same name, in which Paltrow also played the same character at London's Donmar Warehouse between May and June 2002. On her portrayal in the film version, Eye for Film remarked: \"As she has already shown in Sylvia, The Royal Tenenbaums and even Sliding Doors, Paltrow has an uncanny talent for playing women who are coming apart at the seams and her [character] veers from lovably eccentric to more disturbingly unhinged and back again with fluent ease. The scenes, which she and Hopkins share, as two difficult people bound together by affection, dependency and mutual respect, are entirely believable and all the more touching for it.\"[72] For her performance, Paltrow received her second Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama.\nPaltrow filmed small roles for the 2006 films Love and Other Disasters, Running with Scissors and Infamous, where she sang Cole Porter's \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" Her brother Jake Paltrow directed her in his feature debut, the romantic comedy The Good Night (2007), in which she starred opposite Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Martin Freeman, Danny DeVito and Simon Pegg as the wife of a former keyboard player (Freeman). The film received a two-theater run in North America and garnered mixed reviews from critics.[73] View London felt the actress was \"clearly only playing her part as a courtesy to her director brother and it just makes you wish she'd go back to playing lead roles again.\"[74]\n\n2008\u20132013: Iron Man and return to prominence[edit]\nPaltrow saw a resurgence in her career in 2008, when she was cast in Iron Man as Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's personal assistant, closest friend, and budding love interest.[75] First hesitant to appear in a big-budget project, Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics they would consider relevant to her understanding of the character, whom she considered to be very smart, levelheaded, and grounded. She said she liked \"the fact that there's a sexuality that's not blatant.\" The director Jon Favreau wanted Potts and Stark's relationship to be reminiscent of a 1940s screwball comedy, something which Paltrow considered to be fun in an \"innocent yet sexy\" way.[76] Iron Man was favorably received by critics, and with a worldwide gross of $585\u00a0million, it became Paltrow's highest-grossing film until The Avengers (2012).[77] She reprised her role in the sequels Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013). While the second film grossed $623.9\u00a0million internationally,[78] the third entry went on to gross $1.215\u00a0billion.[79] She also reprised the role in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).\nPaltrow starred opposite Joaquin Phoenix in the romantic drama Two Lovers (2008), playing the beautiful but volatile new neighbor of a depressed bachelor. Two Lovers premiered in competition at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival in May, receiving largely positive reviews,[80][81] especially for Paltrow's  and Phoenix's performances; Los Angeles Times felt that \"Phoenix is at his best with Paltrow's bruised sparrow of a girl; he's desperate to take care of her when he can't even take care of himself. She is one of those actresses who understands the power of a look, and the one of regret and then resignation that overtakes her when Leonard professes his love is steeped in sadness.\"[82] The film was an arthouse success, grossing $16\u00a0million worldwide.[83]\n\n Paltrow at the French premiere of Iron Man 3 in 2013\nIn the musical drama Country Strong (2010), she starred as an emotionally unstable country music star who attempts to resurrect her career. She recorded the song \"Country Strong\" for the film's soundtrack,[84] and it was released to country radio stations in August 2010.[85] The film received mediocre reviews and grossed a modest $20.2\u00a0million in North America.[86] The consensus of review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes was: \"The cast gives it their all, and Paltrow handles her songs with aplomb, but Country Strong's clich\u00e9d, disjointed screenplay hits too many bum notes.\"[87] At the 83rd Academy Awards, Paltrow performed another song from the film, \"Coming Home,\" which was nominated for Best Original Song.[88]\nPaltrow made her first scripted television appearance[89] on Fox's Glee, as substitute teacher Holly Holliday, who fills in for Matthew Morrison's character when he falls ill. Her role was developed by co-creator Ryan Murphy, a personal friend of Paltrow's, who suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing abilities ahead of the release of Country Strong.[90] In her first episode, \"The Substitute,\" she sang \"Nowadays\" from the musical Chicago with Lea Michele, CeeLo Green's \"Forget You\", and a mash-up of \"Singin' In the Rain\" and Rihanna's \"Umbrella\" with Morrison and the rest of the cast.[91] Her debut on Glee attracted significant buzz and positive commentary from critics; she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.[92] Indeed, at the time, Entertainment Weekly's Tim Stack and E! Online's Kristin dos Santos called her appearance Emmy-worthy, with the former rating it among her best performances, and the latter stating that Holly received \"some of Glee's best-ever one-liners.\"[93][94]\nShe later performed \"Forget You\" with CeeLo Green himself and several puppet characters provided by The Jim Henson Company at the 2011 Grammy Awards.[95] She reprised her role twice more that season, performing \"Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)\" by Gary Glitter, an acoustic version of \"Landslide\" by Fleetwood Mac, \"Kiss\" by Prince, and Adele's \"Turning Tables.\" Paltrow was briefly featured in Glee: The 3D Concert Movie after being filmed while she performed \"Forget You\" as Holly in the 2011 Glee Live! In Concert! tour performances of June 16 and 17, 2011.[96] Later that year, Paltrow appeared in Steven Soderbergh's film Contagion, featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Marion Cotillard, Kate Winslet and her The Talented Mr. Ripley co-stars Matt Damon and Jude Law. The thriller follows the rapid progress of a lethal indirect contact transmission virus that kills within days.[97] Paltrow played Elizabeth Emhoff, a \"working mom\" and one of the virus' first victims.[98] Contagion received positive reviews and opened atop at the North American box office with $23.1\u00a0million; it went on to gross $75.6\u00a0million domestically and $135.4\u00a0million worldwide.[99]\nShe reprised her role of Pepper Potts in The Avengers (2012), which set numerous box office records, including the biggest opening weekend in North America; it grossed over $1.5\u00a0billion worldwide, becoming Paltrow's most widely seen film.[100] Also in 2012, she starred in the independent romantic dramedy Thanks for Sharing, opposite Mark Ruffalo as people learning to face a challenging and confusing road as they struggle together against sex addiction. Distributed for a limited release in certain parts of the United States, the film garnered mixed reviews and grossed $1\u00a0million domestically.[101] Paste magazine noted that her role \"exhibits some of the same obsessive diet and exercise habits that Paltrow herself has been accused of\u2014a kind of meta character trait that balances the power in [the main roles'] budding relationship.\"[102] In April 2013, Paltrow was named People magazine's annual \"Most Beautiful Woman.\"[103]\n\n2014\u2013present[edit]\nIn 2014, she had a two-episode arc in the improvised online series Web Therapy, as Maya Ganesh, \"a new-age caricature.\"[104] In 2015, she starred in Mortdecai,[105] alongside Johnny Depp, Olivia Munn, and Paul Bettany.

Budgeted at $60\u00a0million, the film only grossed $7.7\u00a0million in North America and $47.3\u00a0million internationally.[106] Paltrow was featured on the track \"Everglow\", which was included in Coldplay's seventh studio album A Head Full of Dreams (2015).[107] In June 2017, Paltrow announced that she would take a break from acting to focus on her business Goop, stating: \"I'm still going to do a little bit here and there, but [the company] really requires almost all of my time.\"[108]\nIn 2019, Paltrow reprised her role as Pepper Potts in Avengers: Endgame.[109] That same year, she played a supporting role in the Netflix comedy-drama series The Politician, playing the mother of Ben Platt's character.[110]\n\nOther ventures[edit]\nActivism[edit]\n Paltrow at the 2012 Academy Awards\nPaltrow is a Save the Children artist ambassador, raising awareness about World Pneumonia Day.[111] She is on the board of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization that works to alleviate poverty in New York City.[112] In October 2014, she hosted a Democratic fundraiser attended by President Barack Obama at her private residence in Los Angeles.[113]\nIn May 2019, Paltrow and actor Bradley Whitford hosted a fundraiser for Democratic presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg.[114]\nIn April 2020, Paltrow, along with other celebrities, discussed the COVID-19 pandemic with Dr. Anthony Fauci on a one-hour-long zoom call. Fauci hoped the celebrities would use their social media \"megaphones\" to encourage proper precautions among their followers.[115][116]\n\nAudiobooks[edit]\nIn 2009, Paltrow narrated the audiobook The Brown Bear & Friends by Bill Martin Jr., the first of a series of children's audiobooks that she narrated. The Brown Bear & Friends audiobook earned Paltrow a Grammy Award nomination for Best Spoken Word Album for Children.[117] Since, she has also narrated Bill Martin's Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?, Baby Bear, Baby Bear, What Do You See?, Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See?, and Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?.[118]\n\nFashion[edit]\nIn May 2005, Paltrow became the face of Est\u00e9e Lauder's Pleasures perfume. She appeared in Chicago on August 17, 2007, to sign bottles of the perfume, and on July 8, 2008, she promoted Lauder's Sensuous perfume in New York with the company's three other models.[119] Est\u00e9e Lauder donates a minimum of $500,000 of sales of items from the 'Pleasures Gwyneth Paltrow' collection to breast cancer research.[120] In 2006, she became the face for Bean Pole International, a Korean fashion brand and in 2014, she partnered with Blo Blow Bar, teaming up with the brand's creative branch.[121]\n\nGoop[edit]\nMain article: Goop (company)\nIn September 2008, Paltrow launched the weekly lifestyle newsletter Goop, encouraging readers to 'nourish the inner aspect'.[122] Goop has expanded into a web-based company, Goop.com. According to Paltrow, the company's name came from someone telling her successful internet companies have double O's in their name,[123] and \"is a nickname, like my name is G.P., so that is really where it came from. And I wanted it to be a word that means nothing and could mean anything.\"[124] Goop has expanded into e-commerce, collaborating with fashion brands, launching pop-up shops,[125] launching a wellness summit,[126] a print magazine,[127] a podcast,[128] and a documentary series streamed on Netflix.[129]\nGoop, and by extension Paltrow, have faced backlash for showcasing expensive products[130] and promoting medically and scientifically impossible treatments, many of which have harmful consequences. The controversies have included vaginal steaming,[131] the use of jade eggs,[132][133] a dangerous coffee enema device,[134][135] and \"Body Vibes\", wearable stickers that were claimed to \"rebalance the energy frequency in our bodies\" and which Goop falsely claimed were made of a NASA-developed material.[136][137] Goop settled a lawsuit regarding the health claims it made over the jade eggs.[138]\nJill Avery, a brand analyst, has noted how Goop's response to criticism seems designed to \"strengthen their brand and draw their customers closer\", noting Goop's references to feminism, traditional Asian medicines and Eastern philosophies, and anti-establishment politics to do so.[139]\nOn January 24, 2020, Netflix released The Goop Lab, a documentary series. The 6-part show promotes Goop, and covers pseudoscientific topics in energy healing, the use of psychedelic drugs, cold therapy, anti-aging, mediumship, and female sexuality.[140][141][142] Critics argued that granting Goop access to Netflix's platform was a \"win for pseudoscience\".[143][144][145] Upon release of the first trailer, and again after the full six-episode series was available, the series sparked controversy concerning the medical and scientific misinformation it presented.[146][147][148][149][150]\nOn January 27, 2020, Truth in Advertising watchdog (TINA.org) filed a complaint with the district attorneys of California alleging that Goop has continued to engage in deceptive marketing.[151] TINA.org's complaint alleges that Goop claims their products are \"clinically-proven\" to treat such symptoms as anxiety, depression, OCD and more.\n\nFood[edit]\nLibrary resources about  Gwyneth Paltrow \nResources in your library\nResources in other libraries\n\nBy Gwyneth Paltrow\nResources in your library\nResources in other libraries\n\nIn October 2007, Paltrow signed for the PBS television series Spain... on the Road Again, which showcases the food and culture of Spain.[152] In 2008, Paltrow co-wrote the book Spain... A Culinary Road Trip with Mario Batali.[153] In 2011, she wrote a book titled My Father's Daughter: Delicious, Easy Recipes Celebrating Family and Togetherness.[154] That same year she penned the book Notes From the Kitchen Table.[155] Two years later she published a book titled It's All Good: Delicious Easy Recipes That Will Make You Look Good and Feel Great, which promoted an elimination diet that is unsupported by medical evidence.[156] Included in that book was a recipe for avocado toast which was widely copied and adapted as part of a 2010s food trend.[157] Also in 2013, Paltrow wrote a foreword for a book by Ross Matthews, Man Up! Tales of My Delusional Self-Confidence. In 2016, Paltrow published a cookbook: It's All Easy: Delicious Weekday Recipes for the Super-Busy Home Cook.[158]\nNegative reaction by a group of scientist and science communication mothers to Paltrow's 2015 video pushing for mandatory labeling of food containing genetically modified organisms led to the creation of a documentary, Science Moms. The film is about mothers who advocate for science-based decision-making concerning the health and nutrition of children.[159]\nIn February 2021 it was reported that Paltrow was suffering from long COVID, leaving her with \"some long-tail fatigue and brain fog\". She advocated treatments for it which involved a \"ketogenic and plant-based\" diet (with no sugar or alcohol), fasting until 11:00 every day and taking infrared saunas. This advice was criticized by national medical director for England Professor Stephen Powis.[160]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nAt age 24, Paltrow was engaged to actor Brad Pitt, whom she dated from 1994 to 1997.[28] They called off the engagement, according to Paltrow, because she was not ready for marriage.[161] Paltrow has since said that, as this was her first high-profile relationship with another celebrity, it taught her the need for public discretion about her romantic life.[162]\nPaltrow had an on-and-off three-year relationship with actor Ben Affleck from 1997 to late 2000.[163] They first split in early 1999; soon afterward, Paltrow persuaded Affleck to star in the film Bounce with her.[164] During the making of the film, the couple started dating again and eventually broke up in October 2000.\nIn October 2002, Paltrow met Chris Martin of the British band Coldplay backstage three weeks after the death of her father, Bruce Paltrow. They married in December 2003 in a ceremony at a hotel in Southern California. Paltrow was pregnant with Martin's child at the time of their wedding.[165] Paltrow and Martin have two children together: daughter Apple, born in May 2004,[166][167] and a son Moses, born in April 2006.[168][169] Moses' name was inspired by a song Chris Martin wrote for Paltrow. Simon Pegg and Martin's bandmate Jonny Buckland are Apple's godfathers.[170]\nPaltrow cut down on work after becoming a mother.[171] She also suffered from postpartum depression after the 2006 birth of her son.[172] In March 2014, Paltrow announced that she and Martin had separated after ten years of marriage, describing the process as \"conscious uncoupling.\"[173][174][175] In her official announcement, Paltrow had her doctor, Dr. Habib Sadeghi, and his dentist wife, Dr. Sherry Sami, explain Conscious Uncoupling. A \"conscious uncoupling is the ability to understand that every irritation and argument [within a marriage] was a signal to look inside ourselves and identify a negative internal object that needed healing,\" Sadeghi explained. \"From this perspective, there are no bad guys, just two people, it's about people as individuals, not just the relationship\".[176]\n\n Paltrow at a ceremony for receiving her Hollywood Walk of Fame star on December 13, 2010\nIn 2014, Paltrow whose father was Jewish and mother is not, was reportedly planning to convert to Judaism,[6][13][177][178]\nIn April 2015, Paltrow filed for divorce,[179] which was finalized on July 14, 2016.[180]\nIn 2014, Paltrow began dating producer Brad Falchuk, whom she met on the set of Glee in 2010. The couple went public with their relationship in April 2015.[181] They announced their engagement on January 8, 2018[182] and the following July, that they would have a \"private and small\" wedding.[183][184]\nThe marriage ceremony was held in September 2018 in The Hamptons on Long Island, New York. Falchuk had been married since 1994 to Suzanne Bukinik Falchuk, who filed for divorce in 2013.\nIn 2004, Paltrow practiced cupping therapy, attending a film premiere with bruises on her back.[185] As of 2013[update], Paltrow practices Transcendental Meditation.[186] While Paltrow had previously smoked one cigarette a week, as of 2018[update] she had cut down.[187]\nIn 2017, Paltrow revealed that during the filming of the 1996 film Emma, producer Harvey Weinstein made unwanted sexual advances toward her. She confided in her then-fianc\u00e9 Brad Pitt, who confronted the producer at an industry event. Weinstein later warned Paltrow not to tell anyone else.[188] Paltrow was, in 2017, a major source for an article written by The New York Times investigative journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey about Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct.[189]\nIn January 2019, retired optometrist Terry Sanderson sued Paltrow for $3.1\u00a0million, claiming that three years earlier she collided with him on a ski slope at Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah, causing him permanent traumatic brain injury.[190] Paltrow counter-sued Sanderson in February, claiming that he was the one who crashed into her. She sought a symbolic $1 in damages, as well as repayment of her legal fees.[191][192]\nPaltrow has received backlash from the scientific community and medical professionals for promoting unproven treatments based on pseudoscience through her company Goop.[193][194]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1991\n\nShout\n\nRebecca\n\n\n\n\nHook\n\nYoung Wendy Darling\n\n\n\n\n1992\n\nCruel Doubt\n\nAngela Pritchard\n\n\n\n\n1993\n\nDeadly Relations\n\nCarol Ann Fagot Applegarth Holland\n\n\n\n\nMalice\n\nPaula Bell\n\n\n\n\nFlesh and Bone\n\nGinnie\n\n\n\n\n1994\n\nMrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle\n\nPaula Hunt\n\n\n\n\n1995\n\nHigher Learning\n\nStudent\n\nUncredited\n\n\nJefferson in Paris\n\nPatsy Jefferson\n\n\n\n\nSeven\n\nTracy Mills\n\n\n\n\nMoonlight and Valentino\n\nLucy Trager\n\n\n\n\n1996\n\nHard Eight\n\nClementine\n\n\n\n\nThe Pallbearer\n\nJulie DeMarco\n\n\n\n\nEmma\n\nEmma Woodhouse\n\n\n\n\n1998\n\nSliding Doors\n\nHelen Quilley\n\n\n\n\nGreat Expectations\n\nEstella Havisham\n\n\n\n\nHush\n\nHelen Baring\n\n\n\n\nA Perfect Murder\n\nEmily Bradford Taylor\n\n\n\n\nShakespeare in Love\n\nViola de Lesseps\n\n\n\n\n1999\n\nThe Talented Mr. Ripley\n\nMarge Sherwood\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\nThe Intern\n\nHerself\n\nUncredited\n\n\nDuets\n\nLiv Dean\n\n\n\n\nBounce\n\nAbby Janello\n\n\n\n\n2001\n\nThe Anniversary Party\n\nSkye Davidson\n\n\n\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums\n\nMargot Tenenbaum\n\n\n\n\nShallow Hal\n\nRosemary Shanahan\n\n\n\n\n2002\n\nSearching for Debra Winger\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\nAustin Powers in Goldmember\n\nDixie Normous\n\nCameo\n\n\nPossession\n\nMaud Bailey\n\n\n\n\n2003\n\nView from the Top\n\nDonna Jensen\n\n\n\n\nSylvia\n\nSylvia Plath\n\n\n\n\n2004\n\nSky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\n\nPolly Perkins\n\n\n\n\n2005\n\nProof\n\nCatherine Llewellyn\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\nInfamous\n\nKitty Dean\n\n\n\n\nLove and Other Disasters\n\nHollywood Jacks\n\nCameo\n\n\nRunning with Scissors\n\nHope Finch\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\nThe Good Night\n\nDora Shaller\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\nTwo Lovers\n\nMichelle Rausch\n\n\n\n\nIron Man\n\nPepper Potts\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\nIron Man 2\n\nPepper Potts\n\n\n\n\nCountry Strong\n\nKelly Canter\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\nGlee: The 3D Concert Movie\n\nHolly Holliday\n\nUncredited[195]\n\n\nContagion\n\nBeth Emhoff\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\nThe Avengers\n\nPepper Potts\n\nCameo\n\n\nThanks for Sharing\n\nPhoebe\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\nIron Man 3\n\nPepper Potts\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\nVirunga\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2015\n\nMortdecai\n\nJohanna Mortdecai\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\nJustin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids\n\nHerself\n\nDocumentary\n\n\n2017\n\nMan in Red Bandana\n\nNarrator\n\nDocumentary;
