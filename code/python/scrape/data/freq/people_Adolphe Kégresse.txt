To improve the mobility of the imperial car park, he invented the K\u00e9gresse track to modify normal motor vehicles into half-tracks. He was also a personal chauffeur of Tsar Nicholas II and the Head of the Mechanical Department of the Russian Imperial Garage at Tsarskoye Selo.[1] The Aide-de-camp to Tsar Nicholas II, Prince Orlov wrote in a letter to the Tsar's Minister of the Court on May 15, 1914:\n \"... I consider K\u00e9gresse an irreplaceable worker and I am afraid his leaving will be a great loss for the garage. Your Highness knows, of course, how much His Majesty appreciates K\u00e9gresse.\"[2]\n In 1908, the architect Lipsky VA designed a second two-storeyed Art Nouveau building for the Russian Imperial garage at Tsaskoye Selo / Pushkin, Saint Petersburg it had a total area of 367.6 sq.

The building is noteworthy and identifiable for inclusion of a grand staircase with an external bas-relief image of one of the first car races held regularly in Tsarskoe Selo before the First World War.[3]\n After World War I K\u00e9gresse was forced to return to his home country, where he was from 1919 employed by the Citro\u00ebn company during the 1920s and 1930s to design half-track vehicles, together with engineer Jacques Hinstin.\n After leaving the Citro\u00ebn company he developed in 1935 the AutoServe gearbox-transmission system.
