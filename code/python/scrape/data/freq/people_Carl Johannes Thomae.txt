{"name": "Carl Johannes Thomae", "content": "\n  Carl Johannes Thomae (sometimes called Johannes Thomae, Karl Johannes Thomae, or Johannes Karl Thomae; 11 December 1840 in Laucha an der Unstrut \u2013 1 April 1921 in Jena) was a German mathematician.\n Thomae, son of Karl August Thomae (head master) and Emilie Gutsmuths, grew up in Laucha an der Unstrut and in 1864 attained a doctorate under Ernst Schering at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In 1866 Thomae attained the habilitation qualification at the University of G\u00f6ttingen and one year later in the year 1867 at the University of Halle. In the year 1874 Thomae married Anna Uhde in Balgst\u00e4dt in the proximity of his native city Laucha an der Unstrut. Their son Walter Thomae was born one year later on 5 November 1875, but Thomae's wife died 5 days after giving birth. In 1879 Thomae became ordentliche professor at the University of Jena. In 1892 he married his second wife Sophie Pr\u00f6pper in Jena. One year later was born Susanne Thomae. In 1914 Thomae, at that time dean of the philosophical faculty at the University of Jena, retired. In 1921 he died in Jena after a short illness. Carl Johannes Thomae's research was concerned with function theory and with what German-speaking mathematicians often call \"Epsilontik\", the precise development of analysis, differential geometry, and topology using epsilon-neighborhoods in the style of Weierstrass. The Thomae function, the Thomae transformation formula (aka, Thomae's transformation and Thomae's theorem),[1][2] the Thomae formula for hyperelliptic curves,[3] and the Sears\u2013Thomae transformation formula[4] are named after him. He called himself Riemann's student, although he never attended a lecture by Riemann.\n ", "tags": ["19th-century German mathematicians", "1840 births", "1921 deaths", "People from Laucha an der Unstrut", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "University of Halle alumni", "University of Jena faculty", "20th-century German mathematicians", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from March 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\n\n\nCarl Johannes ThomaeBorn11 December 1840Laucha an der Unstrut, North German ConfederationDied1 April 1921(1921-04-01) (aged\u00a080)Jena, Weimar RepublicNationalityGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenKnown\u00a0forThomae's function, Thomae's formulaScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of JenaDoctoral advisorErnst Schering\n\n Carl Johannes Thomae (sometimes called Johannes Thomae, Karl Johannes Thomae, or Johannes Karl Thomae; 11 December 1840 in Laucha an der Unstrut \u2013 1 April 1921 in Jena) was a German mathematician.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Works\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nThomae, son of Karl August Thomae (head master) and Emilie Gutsmuths, grew up in Laucha an der Unstrut and in 1864 attained a doctorate under Ernst Schering at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.
