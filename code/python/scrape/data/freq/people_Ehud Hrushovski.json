Ehud Hrushovski earned his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in 1986 under Leo Harrington; his dissertation was titled Contributions to Stable Model Theory.[5] He was a professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology until 1994, when he became a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Hrushovski moved in 2017 to the University of Oxford, where he is the Merton Professor of Mathematical Logic.[6][1]\n Hrushovski is well known for several fundamental contributions to model theory, in particular in the branch that has become known as geometric model theory, and its applications.[7] His PhD thesis revolutionized stable model theory (a part of model theory arising from the stability theory introduced by Saharon Shelah). Shortly afterwards he found counterexamples to the Trichotomy Conjecture of Boris Zilber and his method of proof has become well known as Hrushovski constructions and found many other applications since.[8]\n One of his most famous results is his proof of the geometric Mordell\u2013Lang conjecture in all characteristics using model theory in 1996. This deep proof was a landmark in logic and geometry. He has had many other famous and notable results in model theory and its applications to geometry, algebra, and combinatorics.[9]\n Hrushovski is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2007),[10] and Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (2008). He is a recipient of the Erd\u0151s Prize of \nthe Israel Mathematical Union in 1994, the Rothschild Prize in 1998, the Karp Prize of the Association for Symbolic Logic in 1993 (jointly with Alex Wilkie) and again in 1998,[11] and the 2019 Heinz Hopf Prize.[1] He was an invited speaker at the 1990 International Congress of Mathematicians and a plenary speaker at the 1998 ICM.[12][13]\n He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2020.[14]\n ", "tags": ["1959 births", "Living people", "Israeli mathematicians", "Mathematical logicians", "Fellows of Merton College, Oxford", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty", "Members of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "American Jews", "Israeli Jews", "Model theorists", "Tarski lecturers", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Ehud HrushovskiFRSBorn1959 (age\u00a061\u201362)Known\u00a0for\nModel theory\nHrushovski construction\nScientific careerInstitutions\nUniversity of Oxford\nHebrew University\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nThesisContributions to stable model theoryAcademic advisorsLeo Harrington\n\nEhud Hrushovski FRS (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05e1\u05e7\u05d9\u200e; born 1959) is a mathematical logician.[1] He is a Merton Professor of Mathematical Logic at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford.[2] He was also Professor of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Honours and awards\n\n\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nHrushovski's father, Benjamin Harshav (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\u05d1, n\u00e9 Hruszowski; 1928\u20132015),[4] was a literary theorist, a Yiddish and Hebrew poet and a translator, professor at Yale University and Tel Aviv University in comparative literature.
