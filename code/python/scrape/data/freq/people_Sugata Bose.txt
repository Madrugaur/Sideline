{"name": "Sugata Bose", "content": "\n Sugata Bose (born 7 September 1956) is an Indian historian and politician who has taught and worked in the United States since the mid-1980s. His fields of study are South Asian and Indian Ocean history. Bose taught at Tufts University until 2001, when he accepted the Gardiner Chair of Oceanic History and Affairs at Harvard University.[1] Bose is also the director of the Netaji Research Bureau in Kolkata, India, a research center and archives devoted to the life and work of Bose's great uncle, the Indian nationalist, Subhas Chandra Bose.[2] Bose is the author most recently of His Majesty's Opponent: Subhas Chandra Bose and India's Struggle against Empire (2011) and A Hundred Horizons: The Indian Ocean in the Age of Global Empire (2006).\n From 2014 to 2019, Bose has served as a Member of India's Parliament from the Jadavpur Constituency in West Bengal with his party affiliation in Mamata Banerjee led All India Trinamool Congress (TMC).\n Sugata Bose was born in Calcutta, India. After studying at Presidency College, Kolkata, University of Calcutta Bose subsequently completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge before being named a research fellow of St. Catharine's College at Cambridge in 1981.[3]\n The grandnephew of Indian nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose[2] and grandson of nationalist Sarat Chandra Bose, Bose is the son of former Trinamool Congress parliamentarian Krishna Bose and paediatrician Sisir Kumar Bose.[4] Bose's brother, Sumantra Bose, teaches at the London School of Economics; his sister, Sarmila Bose, is a researcher at Oxford University.[5]\n After completing his PhD at Cambridge, Sugata Bose began his career as a professor of history and diplomacy at Tufts University.[6] In 2001 Bose was appointed to the Gardiner Chair of Oceanic History and Affairs at Harvard University, a position that had lain vacant for almost two decades, one which had been previously occupied by historians of the Western Hemisphere, but one for which Harvard specifically wanted a historian of South Asia.[1] From 2003 to 2010, Bose headed up the university's South Asia initiative as well as the graduate program in the history department.\n In 2011 Bose published His Majesty's Opponent: Subhas Chandra Bose and India's Struggle against Empire, a biography of his great uncle Subhas Bose. The biography, a trade book,[7] has been criticised in scholarly reviews for soft-pedaling or oversimplifying Subhas Chandra Bose's alliances with Italian Fascism, German National Socialism, and Japanese imperialism.[8][9]  The book has also been criticised for its optimistic speculations on what Subhas Bose might have accomplished had he lived.[10] Some popular reviews have been more positive.[11][12][13][14]\n In his earlier A Hundred Horizons: The Indian Ocean in the Age of Global Empire (2006), Bose attempts to challenge the thesis pioneered by Kirti N. Chaudhuri in Trade and Civilisation in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the Rise of Islam to 1750, Cambridge University Press, 1985, ISBN\u00a09780521285421 and developed by Andre Wink and others, which holds that the world's first \"global economy,\" the trans-Indian-ocean maritime economy\u2014whose trade was assisted by the alternating winds and currents of the monsoons and which arose in the wake of the spread of Islam\u2014was in turn undercut by European capitalism in the early 18th century.[15]  Instead, Bose contends, in the main thesis of his book, an inter-regional economy of middle-level bazaar merchants and traders continued well into the late 1920s, existing between the dominant European capitalists at the top and the peasants and peddlers at the bottom.[15]  This according to Bose, was not just the case in the market of goods and services, but also in the barter of ideas and culture.[15]  Attempting to bolster the latter notion are sections in the book on Mohandas K. Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, and Bose's great uncle Subhas Chandra Bose.[15] A Hundred Horizons was praised by academic reviewers for explicating the transformations to networks which linked Indian Ocean societies, beyond the influence of colonial empires,[16] and for exploring \"cosmopolitan notions of anticolonialism\" throughout the Indian Ocean world.[17] However, Bose's delineation of that economy has been criticised for not going much beyond India and Indians,[18][19] for reducing the complex exchange between the British and India to a clash of Indian nationalism and British authoritarianism;[20] and for not providing sufficient warrant for the main thesis in the book.[21]\n Bose is also the author and editor of books on the economic, social and political history of modern South Asia.  Beginning his career with work on the economy of agrarian Bengal, Bose published two volumes on his research. Agrarian Bengal: Economy, Social Structure and Politics, 1919\u20131947, published in 1986, contextualised rural economic life within the wider currents of the global economy,[citation needed] while a 1993 contribution to the New Cambridge History of India, Peasant Labour and Colonial Capital: Rural Bengal since 1770, analysed two and a half centuries of regional economic and social change.[citation needed]\n Sugata Bose was a Trinamool Congress MP (2014 -2019) at the 16th Lok Sabha, representing the Jadavpur constituency.[22]\n In January 2012, Bose joined New Yorker editor David Remnick, former New York Times editor Joseph Lelyveld and journalist Peter Popham at the sixth Jaipur Literature Festival in a panel on the challenges of biographical writing.[23]\n Bose has been active in researching, speaking, and publishing on Rabindranath Tagore, contributing to projects across different media. In 2007, Krishna and Sugata Bose co-edited Purabi: the East in its Feminine Gender, a book and CD of Tagore's poetry and music. Bose has produced a four-CD set of Tagore's songs written outside of India as Visva Yatri Rabindranath, and has lectured widely on Tagore in North America, Europe, and Asia.[24]\n Beyond his work at Harvard and Tufts, Bose has helped steer two major projects advancing higher education in India. Since 2007, Bose has been a member of the Government of India's Nalanda Mentor Group, which seeks to establish an international university on the site of the ancient University of Nalanda in Bihar. Since 2011, Bose has served as chairman of the Presidency College Mentor Group, which seeks to revitalise the 194-year-old Kolkata college.[25] He also served on the Social Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2009, and the Humanities jury in 2015 and 2016.[26]\n ", "tags": ["1956 births", "Bengali people", "Alumni of the University of Cambridge", "21st-century American historians", "American people of Bengali descent", "Bengali historians", "Harvard University faculty", "Historians of South Asia", "Living people", "Politicians from Kolkata", "Presidency University, Kolkata alumni", "Tufts University faculty", "University of Calcutta alumni", "16th Lok Sabha members", "Lok Sabha members from West Bengal", "American people of Indian descent", "All India Trinamool Congress politicians from West Bengal", "People from South 24 Parganas district", "Harv and Sfn multiple-target errors", "Harv and Sfn no-target errors", "Articles with short description", "Articles with short description added by PearBOT 5", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "EngvarB from August 2014", "Use dmy dates from July 2020", "Articles containing Bengali-language text", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from November 2013", "CS1 maint: extra text: authors list", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Indian historian and politician\n\n\nSugata BoseSugata BoseDr. Sugata BoseBorn (1956-09-07) 7 September 1956 (age\u00a064)Kolkata, IndiaNationalityIndianAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Calcutta (B.A.)University of Cambridge (PhD)OccupationHistorian; Member of parliament from Jadavpur Constituency in West BengalEmployerHarvard UniversityNotable workA Hundred Horizons, His Majesty's OpponentPolitical partyAll India Trinamool CongressParent(s)Krishna Bose, Sisir Kumar Bose\nwww.sugatabose.com\nSugata BoseMember of Parliament  for JadavpurIn office2014\u20132019Preceded byKabir SumanSucceeded byMimi Chakraborty\n\nSugata Bose (born 7 September 1956) is an Indian historian and politician who has taught and worked in the United States since the mid-1980s.

As a trade book, it also eschews some of the scholarly paraphernalia that enable a more critical engagement with its contents. Academic circles have long had in Leonard Gordon's Brothers against the Raj: A Biography of Indian Nationalists Sarat and Subhas Chandra Bose (1990) a careful and detailed account of the lives of Subhas Bose and his elder brother Sarat. Sugata Bose's book is not likely to replace Gordon's account.\"\n\n^ Framke 2012, p.\u00a0365: Quote: \"While one can only highly recommend this book as a fine introduction to readers interested in the history of the national independence movement in the first half of the 20th century, in regard to Bose's encounters and interactions with National Socialism and Fascism, the monograph does not provide important new insights. ... Not only this episode, but also several others are interpreted by Sugata Bose in a rather unambiguous way that strongly rejects all possible affinities of Subhas Chandra Bose towards Fascism and National Socialism. In doing so, the author in my understanding, presents a relatively simplistic account of a much complex nature of engagement which Bose nurtured with international and national ideological contexts.\"\n\n^ Zachariah 2012, pp.\u00a0109\u2013110: Quote: \"The fact that he (Subhas Bose) considered himself a socialist, often expressed his displeasure or disagreement with aspects of the Italian or German dictatorships or with Japanese imperialism, and had Jewish friends in Germany and Austria, or that he wrote in his autobiography of the need for a \"synthesis\" between socialism and fascism, is not a substitute for a more nuanced intellectual history that engages seriously with what these ideologies were.\"\n\n^ Wainwright 2013, p.\u00a0361: Quote: \"Less certain are some of the author\u2019s speculations regarding how Bose\u2019s presence in India after the Allied victory might have affected the partition and political culture of the subcontinent.\"\n\n^ Bhattacharya, Sabyasachi (2011). \"Review\".

A historical and literary dance through the history of rising Indian nationalist sentiment against British imperial rule, it appears aimed more for domestic Indian nationalist consumption than for scholars of the Indian Ocean world. In it, Bose grossly underestimates the complexities of the British imperial presence, and the many divisions along ethnic, caste, religious, economic, and political lines that existed among Indians, at home and overseas.
