She was a student and close collaborator of both Paul Erd\u0151s and Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi. She also collaborated frequently with her husband P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n, the analyst, number theorist, and combinatorist (the letter T in her name stands for Tur\u00e1n[1]). Until 1987, she worked at the Department of Analysis at the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest. Since then, she has been employed by the Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics.[2] She was elected a corresponding member (1985), member (1990) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.[3] In 1997, S\u00f3s was awarded the Sz\u00e9chenyi Prize.\n One of her results is the K\u0151v\u00e1ri\u2013S\u00f3s\u2013Tur\u00e1n theorem concerning the maximum possible number of edges in a bipartite graph that does not contain certain complete subgraphs. \nAnother is the following so-called friendship theorem proved with Paul Erd\u0151s and Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi: if, in a finite graph, any two vertices have exactly one common neighbor, then some vertex is joined to all others. In number theory, S\u00f3s proved the three-gap theorem, conjectured by Hugo Steinhaus and proved independently by Stanis\u0142aw \u015awierczkowski.\n Vera S\u00f3s is the daughter of a school teacher. As an adolescent, S\u00f3s attended the Abonyi Street Jewish highschool in Budapest and graduated in 1948. She was later introduced to Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi and Paul Erd\u0151s, who she later collaborated with, by her teacher Tibor Gallai. (Together she and Erd\u0151s have thirty joint papers.) S\u00f3s considered Gallai to be the person who discovered her gift for mathematics. S\u00f3s was also one of three girls out of all the girls in Gallai's class that became a mathematician. S\u00f3s later attended E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University. There, she studied as a mathematics and physics major and graduated in 1952. Although she was still a student, S\u00f3s taught at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University in 1950. At the age of twenty, S\u00f3s attended a Mathematical Congress in Budapest, Hungary and attended a summer internship. S\u00f3s met her husband and collaborator Paul Tur\u00e1n in college. They married in 1952. The two had two children in 1953 and 1960, Gyorgy and Thomas Turan.[4] Tur\u00e1n died in September 1976.\n In 1965, S\u00f3s began the weekly Hajnal\u2013S\u00f3s seminar at the Mathematical Institute of the Hungarian Academy for Science with Andr\u00e1s Hajnal. The seminar is considered to be a \"forum for new results in combinatorics.\"[5] This weekly seminar continues to this day.\n Throughout her years working in mathematics, S\u00f3s has been honored with many awards as a result of her work. One of the many awards includes the Sz\u00e9chenyi Prize, which she received in 1997. The Sz\u00e9chenyi Prize is an award given to those who have greatly contributed to the academic life of Hungary.\n ", "tags": ["1930 births", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "Number theorists", "Combinatorialists", "Members of Academia Europaea", "Living people", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian mathematician\nThe native form of this personal name is T.
