{"name": "Albert Hofmann", "content": "\n \n Psychedelic film\n Albert Hofmann (11 January 1906 \u2013 29 April 2008)[1][2] was a Swiss chemist known best for being the first known person to synthesize, ingest, and learn of the psychedelic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Hofmann was also the first person to isolate, synthesize, and name the principal psychedelic mushroom compounds psilocybin and psilocin.[3] He authored more than 100 scientific articles and numerous books, including LSD: Mein Sorgenkind (LSD: My Problem Child).[2] In 2007, he shared first place with Tim Berners-Lee in a list of the 100 greatest living geniuses, published by The Daily Telegraph newspaper.[4]\n Hofmann was born in Baden, Switzerland, the first of four children to factory toolmaker Adolf Hofmann and his wife Elisabeth (born Elisabeth Schenk). When his father became ill, Hofmann obtained a position as a commercial apprentice in concurrence with his studies. At the age of twenty, Hofmann began his chemistry degree at the University of Z\u00fcrich, finishing three years later, in 1929. Owing to his father's low income, Albert's godfather paid for his education. Hofmann's main interest was the chemistry of plants and animals, and he later conducted important research on the chemical structure of the common animal substance chitin, for which he received his doctorate with distinction in 1929.[5]\n Regarding his decision to pursue a career as a chemist, Hofmann provided insight during a speech he delivered to the 1996 Worlds of Consciousness Conference in Heidelberg, Germany:\n One often asks oneself what roles planning and chance play in the realization of the most important events in our lives. [...] This [career] decision was not easy for me. I had already taken a Latin matricular exam, and therefore a career in the humanities stood out most prominently in the foreground. Moreover, an artistic career was tempting. In the end, however, it was a problem of theoretical knowledge which induced me to study chemistry, which was a great surprise to all who knew me. Mystical experiences in childhood, in which Nature was altered in magical ways, had provoked questions concerning the essence of the external, material world, and chemistry was the scientific field which might afford insights into this.[6]  Hofmann became an employee of the pharmaceutical/chemical department of Sandoz Laboratories (now a subsidiary of Novartis), located in Basel as a coworker with professor Arthur Stoll, founder and director of the pharmaceutical department.[7] He began studying the medicinal plant Drimia maritima (squill) and the fungus ergot, as part of a program to purify and synthesize active constituents for use as pharmaceuticals. His main contribution was to elucidate the chemical structure of the common nucleus of the Scilla glycosides (an active principal of Mediterranean squill).[7] While researching lysergic acid derivatives, Hofmann first synthesized LSD on 16 November 1938.[8] The main intention of the synthesis was to obtain a respiratory and circulatory stimulant (analeptic) with no effects on the uterus in analogy to nikethamide (which is also a diethylamide) by introducing this functional group to lysergic acid. It was set aside for five years, until 16 April 1943, when Hofmann decided to reexamine it. While re-synthesizing LSD, he accidentally absorbed a small amount of the drug through his fingertips and discovered its powerful effects.[9] He described what he felt as being:\n ... affected by a remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness. At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated[-]like condition, characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a dreamlike state, with eyes closed (I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring), I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors. After some two hours this condition faded away.[10] Three days later, on 19 April 1943, Hofmann intentionally ingested 250 micrograms of LSD. This day is now known as \"Bicycle Day\", because he began to feel the effects of the drug as he rode home on a bike. This was the first intentional LSD trip.[11]\n Hofmann continued to take small doses of LSD throughout much of his life, and always hoped to find a use for it. In his memoir, he emphasized it as a \"sacred drug\": \"I see the true importance of LSD in the possibility of providing material aid to meditation aimed at the mystical experience of a deeper, comprehensive reality.\"[12]\n It gave me an inner joy, an open mindedness, a gratefulness, open eyes and an internal sensitivity for the miracles of creation.... I think that in human evolution it has never been as necessary to have this substance LSD. It is just a tool to turn us into what we are supposed to be. Hofmann later discovered 4-Acetoxy-DET (4-acetoxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine, also known as ethacetin, ethylacybin, or 4-AcO-DET); a hallucinogenic tryptamine. He first synthesized 4-AcO-DET in 1958 in the Sandoz lab. Hofmann became director of Sandoz's natural products department and continued studying hallucinogenic substances found in Mexican mushrooms and other plants used by aboriginal people there. This led to the synthesis of psilocybin, the active agent of many \"magic mushrooms.\"[14] Hofmann also became interested in the seeds of the Mexican morning glory species Turbina corymbosa, which are called ololiuqui by natives. He was surprised to find the active compound of ololiuhqui, ergine (LSA, lysergic acid amide) to be closely related to LSD.\n In 1962, Hofmann and his wife Anita Hofmann (n\u00e9e Guanella, sister of Gustav Guanella, an important Swiss inventor) traveled to southern Mexico to search for the plant \"Ska Maria Pastora\" (Leaves of Mary the Shepherdess), later known as Salvia divinorum. He was able to obtain samples of this plant, but never succeeded in identifying its active compound, which has since been identified as the diterpenoid salvinorin A. In 1963, Hofmann attended the annual convention of the World Academy of Arts and Sciences (WAAS) in Stockholm.\n Hofmann, interviewed shortly before his hundredth birthday, called LSD \"medicine for the soul\" and was frustrated by the worldwide prohibition of it. \"It was used very successfully for ten years in psychoanalysis,\" he said, adding that the drug was misused by the counterculture of the 1960s, and then criticized unfairly by the political establishment of the day. He conceded that it could be dangerous if misused, because a relatively high dose of 500 micrograms will have an extremely powerful psychoactive effect, especially if administered to a first-time user without adequate supervision.[15]\n In December 2007, Swiss medical authorities allowed psychotherapist Peter Gasser to perform psycho-therapeutic experiments on patients suffering from terminal-stage cancer and other deadly diseases. Completed in 2011, these represent the first study of the therapeutic effects of LSD on humans in 35 years \u2013 other studies had examined the drug's effects on consciousness and body.[16] Hofmann acclaimed the study and reiterated his belief in LSD's therapeutic benefits.[17] In 2008, Hofmann wrote to Steve Jobs, asking him to support this research; it is not known if Jobs responded.[18] The Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) has supported psychoanalytic research using LSD, carrying on Hofmann's legacy and setting the groundwork for future studies.[19]\n Hofmann was to speak at the World Psychedelic Forum[20] from 21 to 24 March 2008, but had to cancel because of ill health.\n Hofmann was a long-time friend and correspondent of German author and entomologist Ernst J\u00fcnger, whom he met in 1949. J\u00fcnger experimented with LSD with Hofmann; in 1970, J\u00fcnger published a book of his experiences taking several types of drugs, Ann\u00e4herungen. Drogen und Rausch (Approaches: Drugs and Intoxication).\n After retiring from Sandoz in 1971, Hofmann was allowed to take his papers and research home. He gave his archives to the Albert Hofmann Foundation, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit, but the documents mostly sat in storage for years. The archives were sent to the San Francisco area in 2002 to be digitized, but that process was never completed. In 2013, the archives were sent to the Institute of Medical History in Bern, Switzerland, where they are currently being organized. Hofmann felt that everyone should try his \"drug\".\n[21][22]\n Hofmann died at the age of 102 from a heart attack on the 29th April 2008 in Switzerland. [23][24]\n The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) honored him with the title D.Sc. (honoris causa) in 1969 together with Gustav Guanella, his brother-in-law. In 1971 the Swedish Pharmaceutical Association (Sveriges Farmacevtf\u00f6rbund) granted him the Scheele Award, which commemorates the skills and achievements of the Swedish Pomerania chemist and pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele.[25]\n ", "tags": ["1906 births", "2008 deaths", "Swiss chemists", "People associated with the University of Zurich", "University of Zurich alumni", "Psychedelic drug researchers", "Psychedelic drug advocates", "Drug policy reform activists", "Lysergic acid diethylamide", "Swiss centenarians", "People from Baden, Switzerland", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from January 2020", "Wikipedia pages move-protected due to vandalism", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with Spanish-language sources (es)", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "AC with 26 elements", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Swiss chemist\n\n\nNot to be confused with Abbie Hoffman.\n\n\nAlbert HofmannAlbert Hofmann in 1993Born(1906-01-11)11 January 1906Baden, SwitzerlandDied29 April 2008(2008-04-29) (aged\u00a0102)Burg im Leimental, SwitzerlandNationalitySwissAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Z\u00fcrichKnown\u00a0forDiscovery of LSD-25, naming and synthesizing psilocinSpouse(s)Anita Hofmann (?\u20132007) (her death)Children4Scientific careerFieldsChemistry\n\nPart of a series onPsychedelia\nArts\nPsychedelic art\n\nAlgorithmic art\nCyberdelic\nDiffraction\nFractal art\nLiquid light show\nLSD art\nPaisley\nPhosphene\n\nPsychedelic music\n\nAcid house\nAcid jazz\nAcid rock\nAcid techno\nAcid trance\nChillwave\nHypnagogic pop\nMadchester\nNeo-psychedelia\nPeyote song\nP-Funk\nPsychedelic folk\nPsychedelic pop\nPsychedelic rock\nPsychedelic soul\nPsychedelic trance\nSpace rock\nStoner rock\nTrip hop\n\nPsychedelic film\n\n\nAcid Western\nStoner film\n\nPsychedelic literature\n\nCulture\nCounterculture\nEntheogen\nSmart shop\nTrip sitter\nPsychedelic microdosing\n\nDrugs\n25I-NBOMe\n2C-B\nAyahuasca\nCannabis\nDMT\nIbogaine\nKetamine\nLSD\nMescaline\nPeyote\nPsilocybin mushrooms\nSalvinorin A/Salvia\nSan Pedro cactus\n\nList of psychedelic drugs\nList of psilocybin mushrooms\nPsychoactive cactus\n\nExperience\nBad trip\nEcology\nEgo death\nSerotonergic psychedelic\nTherapy\n\nHistory\nAcid Tests\nAlbert Hofmann\nAlexander Shulgin\nHistory of lysergic acid diethylamide\nOwsley Stanley\nPsychedelic era\nSummer of Love\nTimothy Leary\nWilliam Leonard Pickard\n\nLaw\nDrug policy of the Netherlands\nDrug liberalization\nLegality of cannabis\nLegal status of psilocybin mushrooms\nLegal status of Salvia divinorum\n\nRelated topics\nAddiction\nCannabis\nMDMA\nPhilosophy of psychedelics\nPsychonautics\nProhibition of drugs\nRave\nRecreational drug use\nSurrealism\nvte\nAlbert Hofmann (11 January 1906 \u2013 29 April 2008)[1][2] was a Swiss chemist known best for being the first known person to synthesize, ingest, and learn of the psychedelic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).
