{"name": "Victor J. Katz", "content": "Victor Joseph Katz (born 31 December 1942, Philadelphia)[1]  is an American mathematician, historian of mathematics, and teacher known for using the history of mathematics in teaching mathematics.\n Katz received in 1963 from Princeton University a bachelor's degree and in 1968  from Brandeis University a Ph.D. in mathematics under Maurice Auslander with thesis The Brauer group of a regular local ring.[2] He became at Federal City College an assistant professor and then in 1973 an associate professor and, after the merger of Federal City College into the University of the District of Columbia in 1977, a full professor there in 1980. He retired there as professor emeritus in 2005.\n As a mathematician Katz specializes in algebra, but he is mainly known for his work on the history of mathematics and its uses in teaching. He wrote a textbook History of Mathematics: An Introduction (1993), for which he won in 1995 the Watson Davis and Helen Miles Davis Prize. He organized workshops and congresses for the MAA and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The MAA published a collection of teaching materials by Katz as a compact disk with the title Historical Modules for the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics. With Frank Swetz, he was a founding editor of a free online journal on the history of mathematics under the aegis of the MAA; the journal is called Convergence: Where Mathematics, History, and Teaching Interact.[3] In the journal Convergence, Katz and Swetz published a series Mathematical Treasures.[4][5] For a study of the possibilities for using mathematical history in schools, Katz received a grant from the National Science Foundation.\n He has been married since 1969 to Phyllis Katz (n\u00e9e Friedman), a science educator who developed and directed the U.S. national nonprofit organization Hands On Science Outreach, Inc. (HOSO). The couple have three children.\n ", "tags": ["1942 births", "Living people", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Historians of mathematics", "Princeton University alumni", "Brandeis University alumni", "University of the District of Columbia faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles which use infobox templates with no data rows", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nVictor J.
