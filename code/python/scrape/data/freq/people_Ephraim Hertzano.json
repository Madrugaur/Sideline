He originally sold toothbrushes and cosmetics. He invented the tile game Rummikub in the 1940s when card-playing was outlawed under the Fascist regime.

In 1977, it became a best-selling game in the United States.[2] The following year Hertzano published an Official Rummikub Book, which describes three different versions of the game: American, Sabra, and International.[4] The game was first made by Lemada Light Industries Ltd, founded by Hertzano in 1978 and today is one of the most popular family games of all time.\n Hertzano died in September 1987.[5][6]\n ", "tags": ["Romanian inventors", "Romanian businesspeople", "Israeli inventors", "Israeli businesspeople", "Board game designers", "Romanian emigrants to Mandatory Palestine", "1912 births", "1987 deaths", "Israeli Ashkenazi Jews", "Romanian Ashkenazi Jews", "20th-century businesspeople", "CS1 Hebrew-language sources (he)", "Use dmy dates from March 2021", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " Ephraim Hertzano\n\nEphraim Hertzano (1912\u2013 September 1987) was a Romanian-born Israeli board game designer.[1] He is the inventor of the board game, Rummikub.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Awards and recognition\n3 See also\n4 References\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nEphraim Hertzano was born in Romania, to a Jewish family.
