{"name": "Benedict Gross", "content": "Benedict Hyman Gross (born June 22, 1950) is an American mathematician who is a professor at the University of California San Diego,[1] the George Vasmer Leverett Professor of Mathematics Emeritus at Harvard University, and former Dean of Harvard College.[2]\n He is known for his work in number theory, particularly the Gross\u2013Zagier theorem on L-functions of elliptic curves, which he researched with Don Zagier.\n In 1971 he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard University.  He then received an M.Sc. from Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar in 1974 before returning to Harvard and completing his Ph.D. in 1978, under John Tate.[2][3]\n After holding faculty positions at Princeton University and Brown University, Gross became a tenured professor at Harvard in 1985[2] and remained there subsequently, as Dean of Harvard College from 2003 to 2007.[4]\n Benedict Gross was the mathematical consultant for the 1980 film It's My Turn containing the famous scene[5] in which actress Jill Clayburgh, portraying a mathematics professor,  impeccably proves the snake lemma.[6][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n In 2013, while serving as the Chair of the mathematics department at Harvard University, Gross was involved as part of an internal effort to arrange for Martin Nowak, an affiliate of the mathematics department, to receive funding from convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.[7] According to an internal email contained in a report commissioned by the university,\n Professor Gross feels strongly that, given the current federal funding climate, it would be ideal if we could ask Epstein for additional support. Epstein, who keeps in touch with both Gross and Nowak, has offered that he would be willing to provide additional funds both for the Math department and for Professor Nowak\u2019s work. [...] Both Professor Gross and Jeremy Bloxham, [Divisional] Dean of the Sciences, feel that the Math department should be permitted to solicit Epstein for additional funds. They feel that the good his support can do for Professor Nowak\u2019s research outweighs the reputational risk of accepting further funds from him. In addition, they emphasize both that Epstein has served his time for his crime, and that his wealth has been obtained legally, having nothing to do with the crime for which he was convicted. As noted by the editorial board of the Harvard Crimson, this was during a time when Epstein was using his philanthropy and relationship with Nowak to rehabilitate his public image.[8] According to the report, the efforts of Gross, Bloxham, and Nowak were blocked by Michael Smith, who was then the Dean of Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Previous efforts by Gross and Nowak to obtain Epstein's funding, around the time of his conviction, had been blocked by Drew Faust, then the president of Harvard College.\n Gross is a 1986 MacArthur Fellow.\n Gross, Zagier, and Dorian M. Goldfeld won the Cole Prize of the American Mathematical Society in 1987 for their work on the Gross\u2013Zagier theorem.[9] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[10]\n Gross was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992[11] and as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2004.[12]\nHe was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2017.[13]\n He was named as a Harvard University Professor from 2011 to 2016 for his distinguished scholarship and professional work.\n ", "tags": ["1950 births", "Living people", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Number theorists", "Harvard University alumni", "Alumni of the University of Oxford", "Princeton University faculty", "Trustees of the Institute for Advanced Study", "Brown University faculty", "Harvard University faculty", "MacArthur Fellows", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Marshall Scholars", "Members of the American Philosophical Society", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles lacking reliable references", "Articles lacking reliable references from January 2020", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nBenedict GrossBorn (1950-06-22) June 22, 1950 (age\u00a070)NationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materHarvard UniversityOxford UniversityKnown\u00a0forGross\u2013Zagier theorem  Gan\u2013Gross\u2013Prasad conjectureAwardsCole Prize (1987)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsHarvard University  UC San DiegoDoctoral advisorJohn TateDoctoral students\nHenri Darmon\nNoam Elkies\nSusan Goldstine\nRhonda Hatcher\nDipendra Prasad\nWee Teck Gan\nDouglas Ulmer\n\n\nBenedict Hyman Gross (born June 22, 1950) is an American mathematician who is a professor at the University of California San Diego,[1] the George Vasmer Leverett Professor of Mathematics Emeritus at Harvard University, and former Dean of Harvard College.[2]\nHe is known for his work in number theory, particularly the Gross\u2013Zagier theorem on L-functions of elliptic curves, which he researched with Don Zagier.\n\nContents\n\n1 Professional career\n2 Awards and honors\n3 Major publications\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nProfessional career[edit]\nIn 1971 he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard University.
