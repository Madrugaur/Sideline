She teaches undergraduate and graduate content, curriculum, and methods courses.  Her focus includes culturally relevant mathematics, where she explains cognitively demanding mathematics skills from a relevant cultural perspective.[1] In addition, Jones's specialties include integrating elementary school mathematics and music, and the effects of college students\u2019 attitudes and beliefs about mathematics on their success in college. \u00a0 \nJones' accomplishments have earned her recognition by Mathematically Gifted & Black as a Black History Month 2019 Honoree.[1]\n\nBook[edit]\nJones is the author of the book Women Who Count: Honoring African American Women Mathematicians, published in 2019 by the American Mathematical Society.[4]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"Black History Month Honoree 2019: Shelly M.
