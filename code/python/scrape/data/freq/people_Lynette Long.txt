{"name": "Lynette Long", "content": "Lynette Long is a licensed psychologist and former college professor.   She has published more than twenty-five books and dozens of articles and has written two award-winning plays.  A math education expert, she is particularly interested in the math achievement of young girls.  Long coined the phrase \"latchkey children\" with her husband Thomas Long and wrote the bestselling \"Handbook for Latchkey Children and Their Working Parents.\"  She is President and Founder of the not-for-profit: Equal Visibility Everywhere. During the 2016 Democratic Presidential Primary, Long served as the Volunteer Florida State Organizer for Hillary Clinton. She was an at-large Delegate to the Democratic National Convention.  Long is an American feminist and contributor to the feminist movement in the United States.\n Long graduated in 1969 from the University of Illinois with a Bachelor of Science in Zoology and Chemistry.  Subsequent to her undergraduate studies, Lynette went on to acquire a master's degree in Mathematics and Ph.D. in Educational and Counseling Psychology.\n Long is the founder and president of Equal Visibility Everywhere (EVE), a not-for-profit which focuses on researching the under-representation of women on our nation's symbols and icons: currency, stamps, statues, Google Doodles, monuments and memorials, street names, and national holidays.[1] Long was the first person to bring national attention to the fact that there was not a single woman represented on our nation's paper currency.  As a result of her ground-breaking work and the efforts of other feminist groups, the Treasury Department will feature women on United States paper currency.[2] Her research has brought national attention to the fact that only nine of the one hundred statues in National Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol honor women.[3] Long has been instrumental in securing authorization for a statue of Amelia Earhart in the United States Capitol.[4][5]  Long has focused awareness around the country on the general lack of female statuary which has led to an increase in the number of statues of women commissioned.[6] Long is also spearheading an effort to increase the number of Florida State Historical Markers honoring women.  At the time of her initial research in 2017, only six of the 950 markers in the State of Florida specifically honored women.[7] Since 2017, Long has successfully applied for and found funding for numerous Florida State Historical Markers honoring women including, Miami Beach Preservationist Barbara Baer Capitman, Author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Aviatrix Amelia Earhart, Doctor Eleanor Galt Simmons,[8] and Seminole Chief Betty Mae Tiger Jumper.[9] Long is a frequent public speaker often discussing her research on the lack of symbolic representation of women and its psychological impact on women and girls.[10]\n Long is responsible for coining the term latchkey kid and bringing to national attention the hidden plight of latchkey children.[11]  A former elementary and middle school principal, Long noticed her students wearing house keys on chains around their necks.  She interviewed these students and found that they were often lonely or afraid during the two or three hours they spent home alone after school.  These initial conversations led to exhaustive research, hundreds of interviews with latchkey children, their parents, and former latchkey children.[12]  The culmination of her work was published in The Handbook for Latchkey Children and Their Working Parents (with Thomas J. Long) and On My Own: The Kids Self-Care Book as well as in dozens of articles. Long's research has been reported by every major news outlet and in hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles.[13][14]\n Long has appeared on hundreds of radio and television programs as a child development expert including, The Today Show, Good Morning America, The Phil Donahue Show, Geraldo, and The Merv Griffin Show.  She was selected as the national spokesperson for Thomas J. Lipton and Company and Pets are Wonderful. Long was the host of ONE ON ONE WITH DR. LYNETTE LONG a call-in radio program in Okinawa, Japan.
