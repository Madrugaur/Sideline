{"name": "Jan Santini Aichel", "content": "Jan Bla\u017eej Santini Aichel  (3\u00a0February 1677 \u2013 7\u00a0December 1723) was a Czech architect of Italian descent,[1] whose major works represent the unique Baroque Gothic style - the special combination of the Baroque and Gothic styles.\n He was born on the day of Saint Blaise as the oldest son to a respectable family of a Prague stonemasons Santini Aichel (his grandfather Antonio Aichel moved from Italy to Prague in the 1630s) and was baptized in the St. Vitus Cathedral as Johann Blasius Aichel. He was born with a physical disability \u2013 paralysis of a half of his body. This prevented him from a successful follow-up to his father's career. He only served his time of apprenticeship (as did his brother Franz), but he also studied painting from the imperial and royal painter Christian  Schr\u00f6der.\n Around 1696 he started to travel and gain experience. After his journey through Austria he arrived in Rome, Italy, where he had the possibility to meet with the work of a radical architect, Francesco Borromini.[2] Borromini's influence is apparent in his predilection for star-shaped forms and complex symbolism. Many of his buildings are airy and elegant, yet he was considered a maverick genius by his contemporaries and exerted little influence on subsequent generations of Bohemian architects. It was in Italy where Santini incorporated into his name his father's name, Santini.\n In 1700 Santini started to design independently and to build, which ensured his own income, he then became a member of one craft guild and founded his own construction company.\n Santini married Schr\u00f6der's daughter (Veronica Elisabeth) in 1707. They had four children, but all three sons died from tuberculosis at an early age; the only child left was Anna Veronika (born 1713). Santini's wife died seven years later and he remarried a South Bohemian noblewoman, Antonia Ignatia Chrapick\u00e1 of Mohli\u0161kovice whereby Santini was ennobled. Daughter Jana Ludmila and son Jan Ign\u00e1c Rochus were born from this marriage.\n Santini acquired the style of Jean Baptiste Mathey and after his death also finished several works of him. In 1705, he bought Valkounsk\u00fd house (no. 211) in Nerudova street for 3000 gold coins in cash and rebuilt it. Santini became a well-known person, but unfortunately, he died at a fairly young age of 46 and some of his works therefore remained unfinished.\n The asteroid 37699 Santini-Aichl is named in his honour.\n Santini's Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk, Zelen\u00e1 Hora, a World Heritage Site\n Zelen\u00e1 Hora ground plan\n Church of St Wenceslas in Zvole\n Monastery Church of the Assumption of Virgin Mary, St Wolfgang and St Benedict in Kladruby u St\u0159\u00edbra\n Convent of the Cistercian Monastery in Plasy complex\n Interior of the Convent of the Cistercian Monastery in Plasy\n Southern view of the Pilgrimage Church of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary and Cistercian Provost Office in Mari\u00e1nsk\u00e1 T\u00fdnice\n Karlova Koruna Chateau in Chlumec nad Cidlinou\n Original 18th century drawing of Provost Church of St Peter and Paul in Rajhrad by Santini\n Stairs of Church of the Assumption of Our Lady and Saint John the Baptist, Kutn\u00e1 Hora, Czech Republic\n 2.
