{"name": "George P\u00f3lya", "content": "George P\u00f3lya (/\u02c8po\u028alj\u0259/; Hungarian: P\u00f3lya Gy\u00f6rgy [\u02c8po\u02d0j\u0252 \u02c8\u025f\u00f8r\u025f]) (December 13, 1887 \u2013 September 7, 1985) was a Hungarian mathematician. He was a professor of mathematics from 1914 to 1940 at ETH Z\u00fcrich and from 1940 to 1953 at Stanford University. He made fundamental contributions to combinatorics, number theory, numerical analysis and probability theory. He is also noted for his work in heuristics and mathematics education.[3] He has been described as one of The Martians.[4]\n P\u00f3lya was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, to Anna Deutsch and Jakab P\u00f3lya, Hungarian Jews who had converted to the Roman Catholic faith in 1886.[5] Although his parents were religious and he was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, George P\u00f3lya grew up to be an agnostic.[6] He was a professor of mathematics from 1914 to 1940 at ETH Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland and from 1940 to 1953 at Stanford University. He remained Stanford Professor Emeritus for the rest of his life and career. He worked on a range of mathematical topics, including series, number theory, mathematical analysis, geometry, algebra, combinatorics, and probability.[7] He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1928 at Bologna,[8] in 1936 at Oslo, and in 1950 at Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n He died in Palo Alto, California, United States.\n Early in his career, P\u00f3lya wrote with G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151 two influential problem books, Problems and Theorems in Analysis (I: Series, Integral Calculus, Theory of Functions and II: Theory of Functions. Zeros. Polynomials. Determinants. Number Theory. Geometry). Later in his career, he spent considerable effort to identify systematic methods of problem-solving to further discovery and invention in mathematics for students, teachers, and researchers.[9] He wrote five books on the subject: How to Solve It, Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning (Volume I: Induction and Analogy in Mathematics, and Volume II: Patterns of Plausible Inference), and Mathematical Discovery: On Understanding, Learning, and Teaching Problem Solving (volumes 1 and 2).\n In How to Solve It, P\u00f3lya provides general heuristics for solving a gamut of problems, including both mathematical and non-mathematical problems. The book includes advice for teaching students of mathematics and a mini-encyclopedia of heuristic terms. It was translated into several languages and has sold over a million copies.  The book is still used in mathematical education. Douglas Lenat's Automated Mathematician and Eurisko artificial intelligence programs were inspired by P\u00f3lya's work.\n In addition to his works directly addressing problem solving, P\u00f3lya wrote another short book called Mathematical Methods in Science, based on a 1963 work supported by the National Science Foundation, edited by Leon Bowden, and published by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) in 1977. As P\u00f3lya notes in the preface, Bowden carefully followed a tape recording of a course P\u00f3lya gave several times at Stanford in order to put the book together. P\u00f3lya notes in the preface \"that the following pages will be useful, yet they should not be regarded as a finished expression.\"\n There are three prizes named after P\u00f3lya, causing occasional confusion of one for another. In 1969 the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) established the George P\u00f3lya Prize, given alternately in two categories for \"a notable application of combinatorial theory\" and for \"a notable contribution in another area of interest to George P\u00f3lya.\"[10] In 1976 the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) established the George P\u00f3lya Award \"for articles of expository excellence\" published in the College Mathematics Journal.[11] In 1987 the London Mathematical Society (LMS) established the P\u00f3lya Prize for \"outstanding creativity in, imaginative exposition of, or distinguished contribution to, mathematics within the United Kingdom.\"[12]\n A mathematics center has been named in P\u00f3lya's honor at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho. The mathematics center focuses mainly on tutoring students in the subjects of algebra and calculus.[13]\n Stanford University has a Polya Hall named in his honor.[14]  It was built while he was still teaching and he complained to his students that it made people think he was dead.\n ", "tags": ["1887 births", "1985 deaths", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "Mathematics popularizers", "American agnostics", "American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent", "Hungarian Jews", "American statisticians", "Hungarian emigrants to Switzerland", "Combinatorialists", "ETH Zurich faculty", "Hungarian agnostics", "Hungarian statisticians", "Complex analysts", "Mathematical analysts", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Mathematicians from Budapest", "Swiss emigrants to the United States", "Stanford University Department of Mathematics faculty", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "CS1: long volume value", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hungarian-language text", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "AC with 25 elements"], "raw": "Hungarian mathematician\nGeorge P\u00f3lyaGeorge P\u00f3lya, circa 1973Born(1887-12-13)December 13, 1887Budapest, HungaryDiedSeptember 7, 1985(1985-09-07) (aged\u00a097)Palo Alto, California, U.S.NationalityHungarianSwiss (1918\u20131947)American (since 1947)[1]Alma\u00a0materE\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd UniversityKnown\u00a0forP\u00f3lya\u2013Szeg\u0151 inequalityHow to Solve ItMultivariate P\u00f3lya distributionP\u00f3lya conjectureP\u00f3lya enumeration theoremLandau\u2013Kolmogorov inequalityP\u00f3lya\u2013Vinogradov inequalityP\u00f3lya inequalityP\u00f3lya\u2013Aeppli distributionP\u00f3lya urn modelFueter\u2013P\u00f3lya theoremHilbert\u2013P\u00f3lya conjectureScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsETH Z\u00fcrichStanford UniversityDoctoral advisorLip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9rDoctoral studentsAlbert EdreiHans EinsteinFritz GassmannAlbert PflugerJames J.
