{"name": "Massimiliano Fuksas", "content": "Massimiliano Fuksas (born January 9, 1944) is an Italian architect. He is the head of Studio Fuksas in partnership with his wife, Doriana Mandrelli Fuksas,[1] with offices in Rome, Paris and Shenzhen.\n Fuksas was born in Rome in 1944; his father was Lithuanian Jewish while his Catholic mother was the daughter of a French father and an Austrian mother.\n At the beginning of the 1960s, he worked for Giorgio De Chirico in Rome. After he left Italy and worked for a period for Archigram in London, for Henning Larsen and for J\u00f8rn Utzon in Copenhagen. He received his degree in architecture from the La Sapienza University in 1969 in Rome,[2] where he opened his first office in 1967, the GRANMA, collaborating with his first-wife Anna Maria Sacconi.\n From 1985 he has worked in partnership with his second wife, Doriana Mandrelli, who graduated in Architecture in Paris in 2007.[3] Subsequent offices were opened in Paris (1989) and Vienna (1993), Frankfurt (2002) and Shenzhen, China (2008).[3] Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport's new Terminal 3, which his firm designed and built 2008-2013 (with parametric design support by the engineering firm Knippers Helbig), is an outstanding example for the use of parametric design and production technologies in a large scale building.\n Fuksas had two daughters with Doriana Fuksas: Elisa and Lavinia.\n From 1994 to 1997 he was a member of the urban commissions of Berlin and of Salzburg. For many years he has dedicated his special attention to the study of urban problems and in particular to the suburbs. From June 1997 he was advisor to the I.F.A. (Institut Fran\u00e7ais d'Architecture) Administration Board. Since January 2000, he writes the architecture column of the weekly publication L'Espresso, established by Bruno Zevi. In 2000 he was (somewhat ironically in light of his practice of employing unpaid interns for periods up to two years) the Director of The Venice Biennale's - 7th International Architecture Exhibition - \"Less Aesthetics, More Ethics\".[2]\n He is visiting professor at several universities, including the \u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale d'architecture in Paris, and Columbia University in New York.[2][4]\n ", "tags": ["1944 births", "Living people", "Sapienza University of Rome alumni", "20th-century Italian architects", "Postmodern architects", "Artists from Rome", "Italian people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent", "Italian people of French descent", "Italian people of Austrian descent", "Members of the Acad\u00e9mie d'architecture", "Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Commandeurs of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres", "Knights Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic", "Prix Versailles-winning architects and designers", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Italian architect\nMassimiliano FuksasOMRIMassimiliano FuksasBornJanuary 9, 1944RomeNationalityItalianOccupationArchitectAwards\nHonorary Fellowship of the American Institute of Architects\nHonorary Fellowship of the Royal Institute of British Architects\nGrand Prix d'Architecture Fran\u00e7aise\nInternational Architecture Awards 2007\nBuildingsFieraMilano, New Exhibition Hall, Armani Store Fifth Avenue, Armani Ginza Tower, Centro Congressi Italia, Vienna Twin Tower, Z\u00e9nith Music Hall,  Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport, Peres Center for Peace\n\nMassimiliano Fuksas (born January 9, 1944) is an Italian architect.
