{"name": "Serenus of Antino\u00f6polis", "content": "Serenus of Antino\u00f6polis (Greek: \u03a3\u03b5\u03c1\u1fc6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2; c. 300 \u2013 c. 360 AD) was a Greek mathematician from the Late Antique Thebaid in Roman Egypt.\n Serenus came either from Antinoeia or from Antino\u00f6polis, a city in Egypt founded by Hadrian on top of an older settlement. Two sources confirm that he was born in Antino\u00f6polis. It was once believed that he was born in Antissa, but this has been shown to have been based on an error.\n Serenus wrote a commentary on the Conics of Apollonius, which is now lost. We hear from Theon of Alexandria that the main result of the commentary was that of a number of angles that are subtended at a point on a diameter of a circle that is not the center, then with equal arcs of that circle, the angle nearer to the center is always less than the angle farther away from the center.[1]  But he was also a prime mathematician in his own right, having written two works entitled On the Section of a Cylinder and On the Section of a Cone, works that came to be connected to Apollonius' Conics.  This connection helped them to survive through the ages.\n In the preface of On the Section of a Cylinder, Serenus states that his motivation for writing this work, as summarized by Heath, was that \"many persons who were students of geometry were under the erroneous that the oblique section of a cylinder was different from the oblique section of a cone known as an ellipse, whereas it is of course the same curve.\"[1]  The work consists of thirty-three propositions.\n In propositions one though fifty-seven of On the Section of a Cone, Serenus deals largely with the areas of triangular sections of right and scalene cones that are created by planes passing through the vertex. He shows when the area of a triangle of a certain class of triangles is at its maximum. Propositions fifty-eight through sixty-nine form a separate section of the book and deal with the volumes of right cones in relation to their heights, their bases and the areas of triangular sections through the axis.\n ", "tags": ["Ancient Greek mathematicians", "Roman-era Greeks", "300 births", "360 deaths", "4th-century mathematicians", "Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Serenus of Antino\u00f6polis (Greek: \u03a3\u03b5\u03c1\u1fc6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2; c. 300 \u2013 c. 360 AD) was a Greek mathematician from the Late Antique Thebaid in Roman Egypt.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and work\n2 Notes\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nLife and work[edit]\nSerenus came either from Antinoeia or from Antino\u00f6polis, a city in Egypt founded by Hadrian on top of an older settlement.

He gives a definition of parallels that was generally ridiculed.\nIn propositions one though fifty-seven of On the Section of a Cone, Serenus deals largely with the areas of triangular sections of right and scalene cones that are created by planes passing through the vertex. He shows when the area of a triangle of a certain class of triangles is at its maximum.
