Beaver and Barry Arnold.[3]\n De Ruiz held her first teaching position at Roseburg High School in Roseburg, Oregon, where she focused on connecting mathematical concepts to their practical uses by inviting local professionals into her classroom. She also taught adult classes at the Misawa Air Force Base in Japan and, beginning in 1982, began teaching at the United States Air Force Academy, serving as the course director for the differential calculus course at the Academy. She also taught several courses in statistics while at the Academy, maintaining her emphasis on how students can apply the mathematics to solve problems encountered outside of the classroom.
