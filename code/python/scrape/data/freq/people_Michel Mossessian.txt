{"name": "Michel Mossessian", "content": "\n Michel Mossessian (born 11 November 1959) is a French architect of Armenian origin, based in London, UK.\n Michel Mossessian gained his diploma in architecture at the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts UP N\u00b08 (Paris Belleville), where he also engaged in philosophy under Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault. He was a recipient of the Villa Medicis Hors les Murs fellowship and went on to the Cooper Union School of Architecture[1] in New York, where he studied Advanced Design. He subsequently completed his master's degree in design studies at Harvard Graduate School of Design in Cambridge, MA, where he studied with Raphael Moneo and Bill Mitchell, along with studies at the MIT media Lab on artificial intelligence.[2]\n Mossessian worked for Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) as Senior Designer[3] in their Chicago office and as Design Director at the London offices. Along with Senior partner, Larry Oltmanns, they made a successful bid resulting in the design and completion in 2017 of the new NATO headquarters in Brussels.[4]\n In 2005, Mossessian established the architectural studio of Mossessian & Partners, where he serves as principal architect. His first building design in London was the Carmine Building, 5 Merchant Square, a 15-storey office building at Five Merchant Square. As part of the Paddington Basin Development, the building was topped off in 2009, by City of London Mayor, Boris Johnson.[5]\n In 2010, Mossessian & Partners completed three buildings: 5 Merchant Square (headquarters for Marks and Spencers) in Paddington, London;[6] ExxonMobil Headquarters in Shanghai, China; and a private residence in Sorede, France.\n In 2011, the company won an open international competition for an urban renewal project in the Medina of Fes, Morocco which is now on site.[7]\n In 2015 the practice was renamed Mossessian Architecture. Since that time Mossessian Architecture has designed 4 phases of a regeneration scheme in Doha (Msheireb),[8] two buildings in Central London's King's Cross area,[9] and won an international competition to design a museum of the Islamic Faith in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.[10]\n Outside of the practice, Mossessian lectures widely at schools of architecture and cultural institutions. Currently he is a visiting professor at Imperial College London where he lectures on how architecture affects well-being. He also personally organises events to promote innovation and development in the industry.\n Mossessian has a reputation for being at the helm of new approaches and technologies. Edwin Heathcote, Architecture Critic at the Financial Times, described Mossessian as follows: \"Very few architects are able to blend the seductively reductive commercial architecture of Mid-Century Chicago with the lightness of touch and creative flair of contemporary European design \u2014 Mossessian is at the forefront of those few.\"[11]\n His original Black Box method has become a staple of every project the practice delivers and ensures a shared vision from the outset.\n Mossessian is deeply interested in cultural localism and architecture that is concerned with far more than the buildings themselves. Propelled by his vision of creating culturally responsive architecture, he has sought out like-minded organisations, such as UNESCO and the MCC.\n 5 Merchant Square\n - MIPIM Special Tribute to the Country of Honour, UK\n - LEAF Commercial Building of the Year 2012[18]\n - Runner up for 2011 BCO Awards\n Place Lalla Yeddouna\n - Winner of 2014 AR Future Project Cultural Regeneration Award[19]\n - Winner of 2011 Holcim Awards, Urban Precinct Reconstruction & Rehabilitation[20]\n - World Architecture Festival Cultural Regeneration Award 2013\n - LEAF Best Future Building 2012[21]\n - World Architecture Festival Cultural Regeneration 2011\n Msheireb Doha Qatar\n - Overall Winner 2012 AR Future Projects Awards[22]\n - Winner of 2011 AR Future Project Sustainability Award[23]\n - World Architecture Festival Public Realm Award 2013\n - World Architecture Festival Residential Award 2011\n Competitions Awards\n 2016 Makkah Museum, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia  [24] - 1st prize winning entry, expected completion 2020\n 2014 King\u2019s Cross Argent, S1 and S2 block  - Winning entry, completion 2018 and 2020\n 2013 Worldcup Stadium, Qatar - Confidential\n 2011 Mushereib Heart of Doha, phase 4  - Winning entry, 4 high rises, completion 2020\n 2011 Place Lalla Yedouna, Fez - 1st prize winning entry , completion 2017\n 2010 Mushereib Heart of Doha, Qatar, phase 3 - Winning entry, super block T1, completion 2018\n 5 Merchant Square in Paddington Basin, London, UK\n 5 Merchant Square London, UK\n Place Lalla Yeddouna World Heritage Site, Medina of Fez, Morocco\n S1 Building, King's Cross, London, UK\n S2 Building, King's Cross, London, UK\n Msheireb Downtown Doha, Baharat Square, Doha, Qatar\n Msheireb Downtown, Doha Qatar\n NATO Headquarters, Bruxelles, Belgium\n Notes\n ", "tags": ["1959 births", "Living people", "Architects from Paris", "Alumni of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts", "French people of Armenian descent", "Harvard Graduate School of Design alumni", "Cooper Union alumni", "Use dmy dates from February 2018", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nMichel MossessianMichel Mossessian in 2014Born(1959-11-11)11 November 1959 (age 60)Paris, \u00cele-de-France, FranceNationalityFrenchAlma\u00a0mater\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts (Paris-Belleville)  Cooper Union School of Architecture  Harvard Graduate School of DesignOccupationArchitectAwardsMIPIM AR Future Projects Award  Holcim AwardPracticeMossessian ArchitectureBuildingsKing's Cross, London, UK  Exchange House, London, UK 1 Fleet Place, London, UK  Vila Ol\u00edmpica, Barcelona, Spain  Five Merchant Square, London, UK  NATO Headquarters, Brussels, Belgium  ExxonMobil Technology Centre, Shanghai, ChinaProjectsMusheireb - Heart of Doha, Doha, Qatar (in progress)  Place Lalla Yeddouna, Fez, Morocco (December 2013)\nWebsiteOfficial website\nMichel Mossessian (born 11 November 1959) is a French architect of Armenian origin, based in London, UK.\n\nContents\n\n1 Education\n2 Early career\n3 Mossessian Architecture\n4 Design Approach\n5 Significant projects\n6 Awards, Recognition and Other Highlights\n7 Gallery\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\nEducation[edit]\nMichel Mossessian gained his diploma in architecture at the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts UP N\u00b08 (Paris Belleville), where he also engaged in philosophy under Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault.
