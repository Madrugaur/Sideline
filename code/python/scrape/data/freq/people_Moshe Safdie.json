Safdie's multiculturalism, commitment to geographic, social and cultural elements that define a place, and\nconstant search for typological and technological innovation, make him an important architectural figure of the second half of the twentieth and early twenty-first century.[2][3] Coiner of \"For Everyone a Garden,\"[4], Safdie's completed projects include cultural, educational, and civic institutions; neighborhoods and public parks; housing; mixed-use urban centers; airports; and master plans for existing communities and entirely new cities.[5] Safdie's projects can be found in North and South America, the Middle East and throughout Asia. He is most identified with designing Marina Bay Sands and Jewel Changi Airport, as well as his debut project, Habitat 67, originally conceived as his master's thesis at McGill University, which paved the way for his international career.[6] Safdie's thought leadership and exemplary projects have been identified in and inspiration for generations of architects and architecture.[7][8]\n A citizen of Israel, Canada and the United States, Moshe Safdie was born in Haifa in 1938 to a Sephardic Jewish family of Syrian and Lebanese descent.[9] He was nine years old, living in Haifa, when, on May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel.[10] Safdie attended the Reali High School. He spent his summers in a Kibbutz, working the countryside.[11] He tended goats and kept bees. In 1953, the Israeli government restricted imports in response to an economic and currency crisis, severely impacting Safdie's father's textile business.[12] Consequently, at age 15, Safdie and his family relocated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Safdie completed pre-university training at Westmount High School.[13]\n In September 1955 he registered in McGill University Faculty of Engineering's six-year architecture degree program. In his fifth year, Safdie was named University Scholar. The following summer, he was awarded the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) Scholarship and traveled across North America to observe housing developments in major cities.[14] In his final year, Safdie developed his thesis titled \"A Case for City Living\" and described as \"A Three-Dimensional Modular Building System\".[15] He received his degree in 1961.[16] Two years later, at twenty-three years old - while apprenticing with Louis Kahn - Safdie's thesis advisor, Sandy van Ginkel, invited him to submit his project for the World Exposition of 1967.[17]\n Encompassing more than seventy-five completed buildings, communities, and master plans on three continents and an even greater number of projects and competition entries, Safdie's career has evolved in a series of distinct phases.[18]\n In 1964, Safdie established his own firm in Montreal to undertake work on Habitat 67, an adaptation of his thesis at McGill University.[19] Habitat 67 was a central feature of Expo 67; it pioneered the design and implementation of three-dimensional, prefabricated units for living. Habitat 67 was created as a vital neighborhood with open spaces, garden terraces and many other amenities typically reserved for the single-family home, adapted to high-density urban environments[20] \u2013 an important development in architectural history. This seminal project launched the first phase of Safdie's work: A new kind of urbanism.\n The second phase of Safdie\u2019s career coincided with the establishment of a branch office. In 1970, Safdie opened a Jerusalem office.[21] Safdie's work during this period combined his interests in social activism and advanced technologies with profound respect for historic and regional context.[22] He worked on the restoration of the Old City and the construction of Mamilla Center, linking Old and New Cities. Other significant works in Israel include New City of Modi\u2019in, Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, Yitzhak Rabin Center for Israel Studies, Ben Gurion International Airport, National Campus for the Archeology of Israel, multiple projects for Hebrew Union College, and others. During this period, Safdie also worked with leaders in Senegal and Iran.[23]\n Commissions for significant buildings across North America marked Safdie's next phase in his career. Safdie's ongoing interest in geometry as a generator of architectural shape took new direction, alongside a focus on sensual and symbolic architectural experience and a resolve for understanding clients\u2019 aspiration.[24] His cultural projects encapsulated powerful expressions of civic and national identities.[25] Safdie is responsible for the National Gallery of Canada, the Quebec Museum of Civilization, and the Vancouver Library Square. Other notable cultural works include: The Khalsa Heritage Memorial Complex, the national museum of the Sikh people in the Punjab, India; the United States Institute of Peace Headquarters on the Mall in Washington, DC; the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City, Missouri; and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas.\n Safdie's twenty-first century projects \u2013 another milestone in his career \u2013 are characterized by greater geographic range, including the world's most dynamic emerging markets, and for being realized in shorter time spans at larger scales.[26] These landmark developments include: Marina Bay Sands, a mixed-use integrated resort with Singapore's iconic Skypark; Jewel Changi Airport, a new community-centric airport typology combining marketplace and garden; and Raffles City Chongqing, a mixed-use development featuring over one million square meters of housing, office, retail, transportation, and hotel programs. Creator of the world's longest \u2018Horizontal Skyscraper,\u2019[27] Safdie and team are revolutionizing urban development and high-rise building typology with skybridges and multi-level connectivity.[28][29]\n Presently, Safdie and his team are committed to solving contemporary building challenges within workplace, healthcare, and research centers, in imaginative and unexpected ways.[30]\n Moshe Safdie is the Founding Principal and Lead Designer at Safdie Architects, founded in 1964 to realize Habitat 67.[31] Safdie Architects is a research-oriented architecture and urban design studio active in a wide variety of project types, scales, and sectors. Safdie Architects\u2019 global projects are led from its headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts, with satellite offices in Jerusalem, Toronto, Shanghai, and Singapore.[32] Projects are designed, managed, and executed by a global team of less than 100. The practice is organized as a partnership and operates in the model of an intimate design studio environment.[33] The firm's partners \u2013 many of whom joined Safdie after graduation \u2013 have been working together for decades.[34]\n Within his office, Safdie formed a research program to pursue advanced investigation of design topics. The practice-oriented fellowship explores speculative ideas outside normal business practice constraints. Fellows work independently with Safdie and firm principals to formulate specific proposals and research plans. The salaried position is located in-residence, with full access to project teams and outside consultants. Past fellowships include Habitat of the Future, Mobility on Demand, and Tall Buildings in the City.[35]\n In 1978, after teaching at McGill, Ben Gurion, and Yale universities, Safdie was appointed Director of the Urban Design Program at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design (GSD) and moved to Boston, Massachusetts. He served as Director until 1984. From 1984 to 1989, he was the Ian Woodner Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at Harvard.[36] Safdie continues to work closely with the GSD, frequently teaching design studio; Notably, Rethinking the Humanist High-Rise (2019) and Rethinking Hudson Yards (2017).[37][38] Safdie regularly travels to, speaks at, and/or Chairs conferences engaged in industry-defining discussions on architecture and beyond.\n In 1959, Safdie married Nina Nusynowicz, a Polish-Israeli Holocaust survivor. Safdie and Nusynowicz have two children, a daughter and son, born during the inception and erection of Habitat 67. Just before the opening, Safdie and his young family moved into the development. His daughter Taal is an architect in San Diego, a partner of the firm Safdie Rabines Architects; His son Oren is a playwright who has written several plays about architecture.\n In 1981, Safdie married Michal Ronnen, a Jerusalem-born photographer and daughter of artist Vera Ronnen. Safdie and Ronnen have two daughters, Carmelle and Yasmin. Carmelle is an artist, and Yasmin is a social worker.\n Safdie is the recipient of architectural, academic and civic honors \u2013 including several honourary doctorates. He was awarded the Companion of the Order of Canada, the Gold Medal from the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada and the American Institute of Architects, the National Design Award for Lifetime Achievement by the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian, and the Wolf Prize in Architecture.[39]\n The Moshe Safdie Archive, donated to McGill University by the architect in 1990, is one of the most extensive individual collections of architectural documentation in Canada.[40] Comprised of material from 235 projects, the Moshe Safdie Archive records the progression of Safdie's career from his first unpublished university papers to Safdie Architects' current projects. The collection includes over 140,000 drawings, over 200 architectural models, extensive project files, audio visual and digital material, as well as over 100,000\nproject photos and travel slides, 215 personal sketchbooks, and 2,250 large sketches.[41] Administered by the McGill University Library, a list of physical holdings are available to researchers.\n Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts, Kansas City, Missouri\n The Class of 1959 Chapel, Boston, Massachusetts\n Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, Massachusetts\n Yitzhak Rabin Center, Tel Aviv\n Mus\u00e9e de la Civilisation, Quebec City\n Ottawa City Hall, Ottawa\n National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa\n Salt Lake City Public Library, Utah\n Vancouver Library Square, Vancouver, British Columbia\n Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas\n Marina Bay Sands, Singapore\n Skirball Cultural Center, Los Angeles, California\n United States Institute of Peace Headquarters, Washington, D.C.\n Khalsa Heritage Memorial Complex, Anandpur Sahib, India\n ", "tags": ["1938 births", "Canadian architects", "Canadian people of Syrian-Jewish descent", "Canadian people of Lebanese-Jewish descent", "Modernist architects", "Canadian urban planners", "Companions of the Order of Canada", "Harvard University faculty", "Israeli architects", "Jewish architects", "Jewish Canadian artists", "Jewish Canadian writers", "Israeli emigrants to Canada", "Israeli Jews", "Israeli people of Syrian-Jewish descent", "Israeli people of Lebanese-Jewish descent", "Sephardi Jews", "Mizrahi Jews", "Living people", "McGill School of Architecture alumni", "Modernist architecture in Canada", "People from Haifa", "Structuralism", "Canadian people of Israeli descent", "Urban designers", "Urban theorists", "Fellows of the American Institute of Architects", "Use mdy dates from March 2021", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICIA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nIsraeli-Canadian architect\n\"Safdie\" redirects here.
