{"name": "Miranda Cheng", "content": "Miranda Chih-Ning Cheng (Chinese: \u7a0b\u4e4b\u5be7; born 6 June 1979, Taipei)[1] is a Taiwanese-born and Dutch-educated mathematician and theoretical physicist who works as an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam.[2] She is known for formulating the umbral moonshine conjectures[3][4] and for her work on the connections between K3 surfaces and string theory.[3]\n Cheng grew up in Taiwan, where she was first interested in literature. At around twelve years old, she was interested in music, including pop music, rock, and punk. Because the material at  her school was too easy, she skipped two years and got moved to a special class. The  competitiveness and stress that came from school caused her to drop out and leave her parents' home to work at a record store and play in a punk rock band at the age of 16.[5] Despite not completing high school, she was able to enter university through a program for gifted science students that she had gone through.[3]\n After graduating from the Department of Physics at National Taiwan University in 2001,[6][7] she moved to the Netherlands to continue her studies, and earned a master's degree in theoretical physics in 2003 from Utrecht University, under the supervision of Nobel laureate Gerard 't Hooft.[2] She completed her Ph.D. in 2008 from the University of Amsterdam under the joint supervision of Erik Verlinde and Kostas Skenderis.[2][8] After postdoctoral study at Harvard University and working as a researcher at CNRS, she returned to Amsterdam in 2014, with a joint position in the Institute of Physics and Korteweg-de Vries Institute for Mathematics.[2]\n Cheng, along with John Duncan of Case Western Reserve University and Jeffrey Harvey of the University of Chicago, formulated the Umbral Moonshine Conjecture in 2012, providing evidence of 23 new moonshines.[3] They postulated that for each of these moonshines, there is a string theory, in which the string states are counted by the mock modular forms and the finite group captures the model's symmetry.[9] In reference to the string theory underlying umbral moonshine, Cheng said that \u201cit suggests that there\u2019s a special symmetry acting on the physical theory of K3 surfaces.\u201d[4]\n ", "tags": ["1979 births", "Living people", "21st-century Dutch mathematicians", "21st-century Dutch scientists", "Dutch women mathematicians", "Dutch physicists", "Dutch women physicists", "Taiwanese mathematicians", "Taiwanese physicists", "Taiwanese women physicists", "Scientists from Taipei", "Utrecht University alumni", "University of Amsterdam alumni", "University of Amsterdam faculty", "Taiwanese emigrants to the Netherlands", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Taiwanese-born and Dutch-educated mathematician and physicist\nMiranda Chih-Ning Cheng (Chinese: \u7a0b\u4e4b\u5be7; born 6 June 1979, Taipei)[1] is a Taiwanese-born and Dutch-educated mathematician and theoretical physicist who works as an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam.[2] She is known for formulating the umbral moonshine conjectures[3][4] and for her work on the connections between K3 surfaces and string theory.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Education\n3 Work with the Umbral Moonshine Conjecture\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nCheng grew up in Taiwan, where she was first interested in literature.
