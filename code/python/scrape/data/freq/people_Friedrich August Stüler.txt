{"name": "Friedrich August St\u00fcler", "content": "Friedrich August St\u00fcler (28 January 1800 \u2013 18 March 1865) was an influential Prussian architect and builder. His masterpiece is the Neues Museum in Berlin, as well as the dome of the triumphal arch of the main portal of the Berliner Stadtschloss.[1]\n St\u00fcler was born on 28 January 1800 in M\u00fchlhausen. In 1818 he started studying architecture and became a student of Karl Friedrich Schinkel in Berlin.[2] After travelling to France and Italy together with Eduard Knoblauch in 1829 and 1830 and to Russia together with Heinrich Strack in 1831, St\u00fcler became Hofbauinspektor (Royal Buildings Inspector), Hofbaurat (Royal privy councillor for buildings) and director of the commission for the building of the Berliner Stadtschloss in 1832. In 1837, he planned the rebuilding of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, but failed to realise these plans because Tsar Nicholas I of Russia decided to rebuild the original Baroque/Rococo palace instead of St\u00fclers Neo-Renaissance concept. St\u00fcler then returned to Berlin, where King Frederick William IV of Prussia opened a huge array of tasks to him, making him Architekt des K\u00f6nigs (Royal architect) in 1842.\n Together with King Frederick William, who had previously (since his first journey to Italy in 1828) studied Italian architecture, St\u00fcler incorporated Classical antiquity and Renaissance architecture in what was to become Prussian Arcadia. They also conceived a recourse to early Christian motives such as the liturgy of the Early church to avoid political problems with the contemporary church. After the death of Ludwig Persius, St\u00fcler assumed control of the building of the Friedenskirche in Potsdam in 1845. Joint journeys to Italy of St\u00fcler and King Frederick William in 1858/59 deepened the Italian influence from medieval and Quattrocento buildings. His ideas for Cast-iron architecture or the techniques he used for the Neues Museum are more likely influenced from a journey to England in 1842. The building was badly damaged during World War II, but was reopened in 2009.[3]\n St\u00fcler died in Berlin, where he is buried in the Dorotheenstadt cemetery.\n While many of the buildings St\u00fcler built were destroyed in World War II, a few were restored \u2013 not in the original ways, but one can still see St\u00fclers concepts on the outside, especially in the Jakobi church in Berlin.\n Commonly, St\u00fcler is viewed as a student of Karl Friedrich Schinkel as well as an architect of his own right, combining the wishes of Frederick William, Schinkels Classicism and the new Historicism of the Wilhelminian era, though he didn't refer to himself as a student of Schinkel.\n His works were:\n  Media related to Friedrich August St\u00fcler at Wikimedia Commons\n ", "tags": ["1800 births", "1865 deaths", "People from M\u00fchlhausen", "Neoclassical architects", "People from the Province of Saxony", "Recipients of the Royal Gold Medal", "Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art", "Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)", "19th-century German architects", "Burials at the Dorotheenstadt Cemetery", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Prussian architect and builder\n Friedrich August St\u00fcler in 1840\nFriedrich August St\u00fcler (28 January 1800 \u2013 18 March 1865) was an influential Prussian architect and builder.
