Stefano Boeri received international prizes and recognitions.\n\nSelected works[edit]\nBosco Verticale (Vertical Forest) is a model for sustainable residential buildings. A project for metropolitan reforestation that regenerates the environment and the urban biodiversity without expanding the city upon the territory. Vertical Forest is a model of vertical densification of nature within the city. The first unit of Vertical Forest is formed by two residential towers, 119 and 87 meters high, realized in the centre of Milan Isola neighbourhood, that will host 900 trees and over 2000 plants from a wide range of floral species distributed in relation to the fa\u00e7ade position towards the sun. The project, inaugurated in October 2104, was awarded the 2014 International Highrise Award and  the 2015 CTBUH Award, as Best Tall Building Worldwide sponsored by the Council for Tall Building and Urban Habitat and the Illinois Institute of Technology  The project was developed and followed by ex firm partners Gianandrea Barreca and Giovanni La Varra. After this first sustainable model of housing, the studio recently won a competition, in Lausanne, Switzerland, to further develop this model and build a new 117 meters tall residential tower, which will host more than 100 cedar trees and will be covered by shrubs and plants over an area of 3.000 sqm, which construction is scheduled to start in 2017.\nVilla M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e[9] opened in 2013 for Marseilles European Capital of Culture as the new Centre R\u00e9gional de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e in Marseille, France. The multifunctional building overlooking the Port of Marseille docks, 9,000sqm, the project points the sea as its space of reference. The seawater is brought into the project through an artificial dock, between the suspended cantilever of 36m and the underwater conference center. The water plaza enclosed in the building interior lounge is the public space that represents the power of the sea.\nIn December 2020, Boeri and a group of consultants unveiled the designs of 1500 timber vaccination pavilions, adorned with a flower graphic meant to symbolize regeneration, that will be installed around Italy starting January 2021.[10]\nBibliography[edit]\nA vertical forest.
