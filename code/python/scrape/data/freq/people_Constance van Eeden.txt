Kraft, another statistician;\nthe anti-nepotism rules then in force at many universities, including Michigan State, made it difficult for them both to find positions at the same place.[3] From 1961 until 1965 she was at the University of Minnesota, first as a research associate and then as an associate professor, and from 1965 to 1988 she taught at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\nShe retired in 1989, and has held visiting and honorary positions at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al and University of British Columbia since then.[2]\n With her husband, Charles H. Kraft, she wrote A Nonparametric Introduction to Statistics (Macmillan, 1968).[5]\nShe was editor-in-chief of Statistical Theory and Methods Abstracts from 1990 to 2004.[1]\n She has been a fellow of the American Statistical Association and Institute of Mathematical Statistics since 1973, and an elected member of the International Statistical Institute since 1978.\n The International Statistical Institute gave her their Henri Willem Methorst Medal for outstanding service in 1999.[2][1]\nThe Statistical Society of Canada gave her their gold medal in 1990, and made her an honorary member in 2011.[1]\n In May 2002, a symposium was held in honour of her 75th birthday, and a festschrift published from it.[3][6]\n ", "tags": ["1927 births", "20th-century Canadian mathematicians", "20th-century Dutch mathematicians", "Living people", "Dutch statisticians", "Dutch women mathematicians", "Canadian statisticians", "Women statisticians", "Canadian women mathematicians", "People from Delft", "University of Amsterdam alumni", "Michigan State University faculty", "University of Minnesota faculty", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al faculty", "Elected Members of the International Statistical Institute", "Fellows of the American Statistical Association", "Fellows of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Dutch mathematical statistician\nConstance van EedenBorn (1927-04-06) April 6, 1927 (age\u00a094)Delft, South HollandNationalityDutchSpouse(s)Charles H.
