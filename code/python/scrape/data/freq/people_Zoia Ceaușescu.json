She received her Ph.D. in 1977 with thesis On Intertwining Dilations written under the direction of Ciprian Foias.[1] Ceau\u0219escu then worked as a researcher at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy in Bucharest. Her field of specialization was functional analysis. Allegedly, her parents were unhappy with their daughter's choice of doing research in mathematics, so the Institute was disbanded in 1975.
