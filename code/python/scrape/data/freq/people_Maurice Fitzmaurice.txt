From 1922 Fitzmaurice was also an advisor to the Sudanese government on irrigation of the Blue Nile including the plans for the Sennar Dam, which was built after his death.[1] During this time he was also a member of the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps, a voluntary Territorial Army unit providing engineering advice to the British Armed Forces, holding the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He married Ida Dickinson in 1911 and died at his home in London on 17 November 1924.[1]\n Fitzmaurice first became involved with the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1883 as a student member, becoming an associate in 1887 and a full member in 1893.[1] He served on the Institution's Council from 1905 and was elected President for the 1916-7 session.[11] In 1919 he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society and was an honorary member of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Royal Engineers Institution and an honorary fellow of the Society of Engineers.
