{"name": "Hugh Newell Jacobsen", "content": "\n Hugh Newell Jacobsen (March 11, 1929 \u2013 March 4, 2021) was an American architect. He was noted for designing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' home in Martha's Vineyard during the 1980s. He also restored part of the U.S. Embassy in Paris, as well as Spaso House in Moscow.\n Jacobsen was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in March 1929, the son of Lucy Ellen (Newell) and John Edwall Jacobsen.[1] His father was initially employed as a meat importer and later worked for the War Shipping Administration during World War II. Consequently, the Jacobsen family moved to Washington, D.C., and he graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947. Jacobsen went on to study fine arts at the University of Maryland, obtaining a bachelor's degree in 1951. Although he originally intended to become a portrait painter, his father advised him to go into architecture for its job security.[2] Subsequently, he undertook postgraduate studies at Yale University, earning a Master of Architecture in 1955.[2][3][4]\n After completing his formal education, Jacobsen briefly worked in New Canaan, Connecticut, apprenticing to Philip Johnson in 1955.[5] Subsequently, he worked for Keyes, Lethbridge and Condon in Washington, D.C., from 1957 to 1958,[3] and was also taught by Louis Kahn.[2] Jacobsen opened his eponymous Georgetown architectural firm in 1958.[2][3]\n Jacobsen was widely known for his modern pavilion-based residences\u2014composed of simple, gabled forms, rectangular in plan. Unlike other second-generation Modernist architects who revisited the iconic European houses of the 1920s or the American shingle style of the nineteenth century, Jacobsen drew inspiration from the vernacular architecture of the American homestead. His large but intimately scaled pavilions recall the barns, detached kitchens, and smokehouses\u2014the outbuildings\u2014of rural America.[4][6][7]\n Jacobsen designed Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' home in Martha's Vineyard,[8] which was completed in 1981.[2] There was initially public outcry over concerns that his modern design would contrast jarringly with the adjacent historic cottages. However, the design was ultimately subtle, more akin to \"New England saltbox than brutalist concrete fantasy\".[2] He was also commissioned by Meryl Streep, James Garner, and Rachel Lambert Mellon, among others.[2]\n Other well known works of Jacobsen include his addition under the West Terrace of the United States Capitol, as well as the restoration of the Renwick Gallery and Arts and Industries Building, all in Washington, D.C. He also refurbished the H\u00f4tel de Talleyrand section of the U.S. Embassy in Paris and Spaso House in Moscow. He designed structures for universities such as Georgetown University, the University of Maryland (his alma mater), University of Michigan, and University of Oklahoma.[2]\n Jacobsen was elected into the National Academy of Design in 1988, first as an Associate member, before becoming a full Academician four years later.[9] He was one of a small number of architects chosen in 1998 to participate in designed the Dream House series.[2]  This was promotion by Life magazine where famed architects designed homes, and plans were made publicly available.[10][11] He ended up selling over 900,000 plans, and the houses built from them were constructed in countries such as Argentina, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.[2]\n Jacobsen was married to Ruth \"Robin\" Kearney until her death in 2010. Together, they had three children: John, Matthew, and Simon. He had dyslexia.[2]\n Jacobsen died on March 4, 2021, at an assisted living facility in Front Royal, Virginia. He was 91, and suffered from complications caused by COVID-19 including pneumonia in the time leading up to his death.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1929 births", "2021 deaths", "20th-century American architects", "21st-century American architects", "Architects from Michigan", "Architects from Washington, D.C.", "People from Grand Rapids, Michigan", "People with dyslexia", "University of Maryland, College Park alumni", "University of Michigan campus", "Yale University alumni", "Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in Virginia", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from March 2021", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American architect\n\n\nHugh Newell JacobsenBorn(1929-03-11)March 11, 1929Grand Rapids, Michigan, U.S.DiedMarch 4, 2021(2021-03-04) (aged\u00a091)Front Royal, Virginia, U.S.NationalityAmericanOccupationArchitectBuildings\nBeech House, 1963\nUniversity of Michigan Alumni Center, 1982\nBuckwalter House, 1982\nAddition to the United States Capitol, 1993\nProjectsThe Weitzenhoffer Wing of the Fred Jones Art Center, University of Oklahoma.\n\nHugh Newell Jacobsen (March 11, 1929 \u2013 March 4, 2021) was an American architect.
