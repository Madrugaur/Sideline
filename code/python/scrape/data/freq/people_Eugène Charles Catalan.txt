In 1825, he traveled to Paris and learned mathematics at \u00c9cole Polytechnique, where he met Joseph Liouville (1833). In December 1834 he was expelled along with most of the students in his year for political reasons;[2] he resumed his studies in January 1835, graduated that summer, and went on to teach at Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne. Catalan came back to the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, and, with the help of Liouville, obtained his degree in mathematics in 1841. He went on to Charlemagne College to teach descriptive geometry. Though he was politically active and strongly left-wing, leading him to participate in the 1848 Revolution, he had an animated career and also sat in the France's Chamber of Deputies.
