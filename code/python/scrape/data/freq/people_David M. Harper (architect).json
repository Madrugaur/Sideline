He also served the entire undergraduate student body in Student Government as Chairman of Community Affairs, forming the Gardner-Harper Commission to serve as a bridge between the university and the City of Coral Gables.[45]\n   In 1973, while still a student, Harper designed his first professional project: the Steven and Dorothea Green Library at Florida International University\u2019s Modesto A. Maidique Campus.\n As a result, the firm at which he worked, Ferendino/Grafton/Spillis/Candela, put Harper on a fast track, a decision Harper said \u201c...ultimately led me to start my own firm...\u201d \nIn 2012, Florida International University recognized Harper for his three decades of design on the campus and financial contributions to the FIU Library, where he was honored by the university with the naming of the library\u2019s central activity space, \u201cThe David M.

The competition recognized the top designer at the university for his/her senior year architectural design project. Miami-Dade County then presented Harper\u2019s project to the public during the process of planning for the new county library.[47]\n In 1974, the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies (IAUS) invited Harper to spend his thesis year in New York City (the IAUS functioned under architect Peter Eisenman who developed its curriculum and began its undergraduate education program in 1973). The program was open to an \u00e9lite group of invited students from a consortium of distinguished liberal arts colleges and schools of architecture.[48]\n Upon his graduation from the University of Miami in 1975, Harper was awarded the Alpha Rho Chi Medal.[49]\n In 1979, Harper established his firm, \"Harper & Buzinec,\" and by 1984, had a staff of 47 and nearly $82 million worth of designs in various stages of production.[50]  Former partner Paul Buzinec was quoted as saying, \"David's at the top of the pyramid.  His imagination and enthusiasm keep him up.\"  George Allen, executive vice president of the Florida Association of the American Institute of Architects said, \"David has a unique capability in the field of architecture.\" And mentor Ed Grafton, who handpicked David as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 said, \"I thought he was very bright and quick. And that's the whole business of personal service. You're not baking bread and your're not making automobiles. The whole is people's minds - that's what you sell.\"\n His professional growth is accredited to his aggressive marketing techniques, good design sense, and knowledge of business management and diplomacy.[50]  In 1980, Harper's regional and national design work gained recognition with the winning remodel design of the FA/AIA Headquarters Building in Tallahassee.
