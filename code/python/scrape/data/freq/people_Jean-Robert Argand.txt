In 1806, while managing a bookstore in Paris, he published the idea of geometrical interpretation of complex numbers known as the Argand diagram and is known for the first rigorous proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.\n Jean-Robert Argand was born in Geneva, then Republic of Geneva, to Jacques Argand and Eve Carnac.  His background and education are mostly unknown.  Since his knowledge of mathematics was self-taught and he did not belong to any mathematical organizations, he likely pursued mathematics as a hobby rather than a profession.\n Argand moved to Paris in 1806 with his family and, when managing a bookshop there, privately published his Essai sur une mani\u00e8re de repr\u00e9senter les quantit\u00e9s imaginaires dans les constructions g\u00e9om\u00e9triques (Essay on a method of representing imaginary quantities). In 1813, it was republished in the French journal Annales de Math\u00e9matiques. The Essay discussed a method of graphing complex numbers via analytical geometry. It proposed the interpretation of the value i as a rotation of 90 degrees in the Argand plane.

It was the first complete and rigorous proof of the theorem, and was also the first proof to generalize the fundamental theorem of algebra to include polynomials with complex coefficients. In 1978 it was called by The Mathematical Intelligencer \u201cboth ingenious and profound,\u201d and was later referenced in Cauchy's Cours d\u2019Analyse and Chrystal's influential textbook Algebra.\n Jean-Robert Argand died of an unknown cause on August 13, 1822 in Paris.\n ", "tags": ["1768 births", "1822 deaths", "Scientists from the Republic of Geneva", "Amateur mathematicians", "19th-century Swiss mathematicians", "Complex numbers", "People from Geneva", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Jean-Robert ArgandBornJuly 18, 1768Geneva, Republic of GenevaDiedAugust 13, 1822\u00a0(1822-08-14) (aged\u00a054)ParisNationalityRepublic of Geneva, and then Switzerland (since 1815)Known\u00a0forArgand diagram and Proof of Fundamental Theorem of AlgebraScientific careerFieldsMathematics\nJean-Robert Argand (UK: /\u02c8\u0251\u02d0r\u0261\u00e6nd/, US: /\u02cc\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8\u0261\u0251\u02d0n(d)/,[1][2] French:\u00a0[\u0292\u0251\u0303 \u0281\u0254b\u025b\u0281 a\u0281\u0261\u0251\u0303]; July 18, 1768 \u2013 August 13, 1822) was an amateur mathematician.
