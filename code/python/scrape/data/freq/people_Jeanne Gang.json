Her studios have explored how design can help create beneficial connections between people and their environments, with a focus on cities, ecologies materials and other technologies of the 21st century.\n Gang lectures frequently throughout the world. In 2016, she presented at the TEDWomen conference.[22][23]\n Gang's built work in the Chicago area includes the University of Chicago Campus North Residential Commons,[24] Writers Theatre,[25] City Hyde Park,[26] the WMS Boathouse at Clark Park[27] and Eleanor Boathouse at Park 571[28] on the Chicago River, Northerly Island, Aqua Tower, the Nature Boardwalk at Lincoln Park Zoo,[29] the Columbia College Chicago Media Production Center,[30] and the SOS Children's Villages Lavezzorio Community Center,[31] among others.
