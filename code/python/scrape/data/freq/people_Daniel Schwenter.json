He was professor of oriental languages and mathematics at the University of Altdorf.

Among other topics, Geometriae practicae covers the art of baculometry - the measuring of inaccessible distances via staves.\n As a linguist, Schwenter was familiar with Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, and Aramaic.

The scioptric ball provided a firm anchor for a microscope or telescope while allowing the telescope to be swiveled in all directions in order to follow the course of an eclipse or for drawing panoramic views.  The microscope or telescope passes through the center of the ball, the essential function being similar to that of the ball (or pan-and-tilt) head on a modern photographer's tripod.\n Schwenter did not invent the fountain pen, but in 1636, in his Deliciae Physic-Mathematicae, he described a pen made in two parts, using portions of seven quills.[2]  One part served as a reservoir for ink and included the writing point. The second part provided the pen body (a full-length feather) and served as a plug in the back end of the first part.  The ink was sealed inside first part by the second.
