He was born in Moscow and lost his eyesight completely due to an unsuccessful eye surgery after a primus stove explosion when he was 14. Despite his blindness he was able to become one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, partially with the help of his mother Tatyana Andreevna who read mathematical books and papers (notably those of Heinz Hopf, J. H. C. Whitehead, and Hassler Whitney) to him. He made major discoveries in a number of fields of mathematics, including algebraic topology and differential topology.\n Pontryagin worked on duality theory for homology while still a student. He went on to lay foundations for the abstract theory of the Fourier transform, now called Pontryagin duality. With Ren\u00e9 Thom, he is regarded as one of the co-founders of cobordism theory, and co-discoverers of the central idea of this theory, that framed cobordism and stable homotopy are equivalent.[1] This led to the introduction around 1940 of a theory of certain characteristic classes, now called Pontryagin classes, designed to vanish on a manifold that is a boundary. In 1942 he introduced the cohomology operations now called Pontryagin squares. Moreover, in operator theory there are specific instances of Krein spaces called  Pontryagin spaces.\n Later in his career he worked in optimal control theory. His maximum principle is fundamental to the modern  theory of optimization. He also introduced there the idea of a bang-bang principle, to describe situations where the applied control at each moment is either the maximum 'steer', or none.[citation needed]\n Pontryagin authored several influential monographs as well as popular textbooks in mathematics.\n Pontryagin's students include Dmitri Anosov, Vladimir Boltyansky, Revaz Gamkrelidze, Evgeni Mishchenko, Mikhail Postnikov, Vladimir Rokhlin, and Mikhail Zelikin.\n Pontryagin was accused of anti-Semitism on several occasions. For example, he attacked Nathan Jacobson for being a \"mediocre scientist\" representing the \"Zionism movement\", while both men were vice-presidents of the International Mathematical Union.[2][3] He rejected  charges of anti-Semitism in an article published in Science in 1979,[4] claiming that he struggled with Zionism, which he considered a form of racism.[3] When a prominent Soviet Jewish mathematician, Grigory Margulis, was selected by the  IMU to receive the Fields Medal at the upcoming 1978 ICM, Pontryagin, who was a member of the Executive Committee of the IMU at the time, vigorously objected.[5] Although the IMU stood by its decision to award Margulis the Fields Medal, Margulis was denied a Soviet exit visa by the Soviet authorities and was unable to attend the 1978 ICM in person.[5]\nPontryagin also participated in a few notorious political campaigns in the Soviet Union, most notably, in the Luzin affair.\n ", "tags": ["1908 births", "1988 deaths", "Blind people from Russia", "Control theorists", "Heroes of Socialist Labour", "Soviet mathematicians", "Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Blind academics", "20th-century Russian mathematicians", "Soviet people", "Moscow State University faculty", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from August 2017", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Lev PontryaginLev Semenovich Pontryagin (left)Born(1908-09-03)3 September 1908Moscow, Russian EmpireDied3 May 1988(1988-05-03) (aged\u00a079)Moscow, Soviet UnionNationalitySoviet UnionKnown\u00a0forPontryagin duality Pontryagin class Pontryagin cohomology operation Pontryagin's maximum principle Andronov\u2013Pontryagin criterionScientific careerFieldsMathematicsDoctoral advisorPavel AlexandrovDoctoral studentsDmitri AnosovVladimir BoltyanskyRevaz GamkrelidzeEvgenii Mishchenko\u00a0[ru]Mikhail PostnikovMikhail Zelikin\n\nLev Semyonovich Pontryagin (Russian: \u041b\u0435\u0432 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0451\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041f\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0433\u0438\u043d, also written Pontriagin or Pontrjagin) (3\u00a0September 1908 \u2013 3 May 1988) was a Soviet mathematician.
