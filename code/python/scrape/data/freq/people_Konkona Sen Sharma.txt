For the latter, she received both the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award and the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Metro.

She noted her excitement toward these two projects as these were the first films in which she had to lip-sync for songs. In the first one, Laaga Chunari Mein Daag, a drama directed by Pradeep Sarkar, she portrayed the character of a Banaras small town young woman, Chutki, alongside Rani Mukerji. The film was a critical and commercial failure in India, even though her performance was received well. The second one was Aaja Nachle, which was widely promoted as the comeback film of Madhuri Dixit. The film did not do well. Rajeev Masand from CNN-IBN noted her performance in the film as being \"...nothing short of fantastic. Her greatest strength is that she isn't afraid of making a fool of herself and she doesn't worry about being laughed at.

Upon release, the film received universally positive reviews,[25] and her performance received rave reviews. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama wrote, \"Konkona is natural to the core and the best part is, she's so effortless. Here's another winning performance from this incredible performer.\"[26] The New York Times wrote, \"Ms. Sharma has made a specialty of characters like Aisha: independent urban women, whose dreams involve careers as well as love. Her Aisha is a nuanced creation\u00a0\u2014 ambitious, sympathetic, believable\u00a0\u2014 and Mr. Mukerji, making his directing debut, is right to let her run away with the film.\"[27]\n In 2010, Sen Sharma starred in Ashwani Dheer's comedy Atithi Tum Kab Jaoge opposite Ajay Devgan and Paresh Rawal.[28] and Neeraj Pathak's Right Yaa Wrong where she played a lawyer.

In October, she played a character based on Nupur Talwar in Vishal Bhardwaj's film Talvar, regarding the 2008 Noida Double Murder case.
