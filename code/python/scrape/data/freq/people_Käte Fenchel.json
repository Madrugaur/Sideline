She faced some gender discrimination in attempting to complete her studies in pure mathematics at the University of Berlin, and went into mathematics education as a fallback at first. As Adolf Hitler came to power, she lost her job and married Werner Fenchel, also a Jew. The newlyweds escaped to Denmark, where she helped other German Jews escape Nazi persecution.
