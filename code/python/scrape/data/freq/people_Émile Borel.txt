{"name": 0.001893939393939394, "content": "F\u00e9lix \u00c9douard Justin \u00c9mile Borel (French:\u00a0[b\u0254\u0281\u025bl]; 7 January 1871 \u2013 3 February 1956)[1] was a French mathematician[2] and politician. As a mathematician, he was known for his founding work in the areas of measure theory and probability.\n Borel was born in Saint-Affrique, Aveyron, the son of a Protestant pastor.[3] He studied at the Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe and Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand before applying to both the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure and the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He qualified in the first position for both and chose to attend the former institution in 1889. That year he also won the concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, an annual national mathematics competition. After graduating in 1892, he placed first in the agr\u00e9gation, a competitive civil service examination leading to the position of professeur agr\u00e9g\u00e9. His thesis, published in 1893, was titled Sur quelques points de la th\u00e9orie des fonctions (\"On some points in the theory of functions\"). That year, Borel started a four-year stint as a lecturer at the University of Lille, during which time he published 22 research papers. He returned to the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in 1897, and was appointed to the chair of theory of functions, which he held until 1941.[4]\n In 1901, Borel married 17-year-old Marguerite, the daughter of colleague Paul \u00c9mile Appel; she later wrote more than 30 novels under the pseudonym Camille Marbo. \u00c9mile Borel died in Paris on 3 February 1956.[4]\n Along with Ren\u00e9-Louis Baire and Henri Lebesgue, \u00c9mile Borel was among the pioneers of measure theory and its application to probability theory. The concept of a Borel set is named in his honor. One of his books on probability introduced the amusing thought experiment that entered popular culture under the name infinite monkey theorem or the like.  He also published a series of papers (1921\u201327) that first defined games of strategy.[5]\n With the development of statistical hypothesis testing in the early 1900s various tests for randomness were proposed. Sometimes these were claimed to have some kind of general significance, but mostly they were just viewed as simple practical methods. In 1909, Borel formulated the notion that numbers picked randomly on the basis of their value are almost always normal, and with explicit constructions in terms of digits, it is quite straightforward to get numbers that are normal.[6]\n In 1913 and 1914 he bridged the gap between hyperbolic geometry and special relativity with expository work. For instance, his book Introduction G\u00e9om\u00e9trique \u00e0 quelques Th\u00e9ories Physiques[7] described hyperbolic rotations as transformations that leave a hyperbola stable just as a circle around a rotational center is stable.\n In 1922, he founded Paris Institute of Statistics, the oldest French school for statistics\u00a0; then in 1928 he co-founded Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9 in Paris.\n In the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, he was active in politics. From 1924 to 1936, he was a member of the Chamber of Deputies.[8] In 1925, he was Minister of Marine in the cabinet of fellow mathematician Paul Painlev\u00e9. During the Second World War, he was a member of the French Resistance.\n Besides the Centre \u00c9mile Borel at the Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9 in Paris\nand a crater on the Moon, the following mathematical notions are named after him:\n Borel also described a poker model which he coins La Relance in his 1938 book Applications de la th\u00e9orie des probabilit\u00e9s aux Jeux de Hasard.[9]\n Borel was awarded the Resistance Medal in 1950.[4]\n \n ", "tags": ["1871 births", "1956 deaths", "People from Aveyron", "Politicians from Occitanie", "Radical Party (France) politicians", "Republican-Socialist Party politicians", "Ministers of Marine", "Members of the 13th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic", "Members of the 14th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic", "Members of the 15th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic", "19th-century French mathematicians", "20th-century French mathematicians", "Probability theorists", "Measure theorists", "Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand alumni", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni", "Lille University of Science and Technology faculty", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "French military personnel of World War I", "French Resistance members", "Grand Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Recipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)", "Recipients of the Resistance Medal", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with French-language sources (fr)", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "AC with 25 elements"], "raw": "French mathematician (1871\u20131956)\nNot to be confused with Armand Borel.\n\u00c9mile Borel\u00c9mile Borel (1932)Minister of MarineIn office17 April 1925\u00a0\u2013 28 November 1925Prime MinisterPaul Painlev\u00e9Preceded byJacques-Louis DumesnilSucceeded byGeorges LeyguesMember of the Chamber of DeputiesIn office15 June 1924\u00a0\u2013 4 June 1936\nPersonal detailsBornF\u00e9lix \u00c9douard Justin \u00c9mile Borel(1871-01-07)7 January 1871Saint-Affrique, FranceDied3 February 1956(1956-02-03) (aged\u00a085)Paris, FranceNationalityFrench\nAlma\u00a0mater\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure ParisKnown\u00a0forMeasure theory  Probability theoryScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of ParisThesisSur quelques points de la th\u00e9orie des fonctions\u00a0(1893)Doctoral advisorGaston DarbouxDoctoral studentsPaul DienesHenri LebesguePaul MontelGeorges Valiron\n\nF\u00e9lix \u00c9douard Justin \u00c9mile Borel (French:\u00a0[b\u0254\u0281\u025bl]; 7 January 1871 \u2013 3 February 1956)[1] was a French mathematician[2] and politician.
