They differed from each other in that von Neumann had added to Zermelo's theory a notion of classes, collections of mathematical objects that are defined by some property but do not necessarily form a set. (Often, intuitively, proper classes are \"too big\" to form sets; for instance, the collection of all sets cannot itself be a set, by Russell's paradox, but it can be a class.)
