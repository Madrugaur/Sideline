{"name": "Frei Otto", "content": "\n Frei Paul Otto (German: [\u02c8f\u0281a\u026a \u02c8\u0294\u0254to]; 31 May 1925 \u2013 9 March 2015) was a German architect and structural engineer noted for his use of lightweight structures, in particular tensile and membrane structures, including the roof of the Olympic Stadium in Munich for the 1972 Summer Olympics.\n Otto won the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 2006 and was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2015, shortly before his death.\n Otto was born in Siegmar, Germany, and grew up in Berlin. He studied architecture in Berlin before being drafted into the Luftwaffe as a fighter pilot in the last years of World War II.  He was interned in a prisoner of war camp near Chartres (France) and with his aviation engineering training and lack of material and an urgent need for housing, began experimenting with tents for shelter.[1] After the war he studied briefly in the US and visited Erich Mendelsohn, Mies van der Rohe, Richard Neutra, and Frank Lloyd Wright.\n He began a private practice in Germany in 1952. His saddle-shaped cable-net music pavilion at the Bundesgartenschau (Federal Garden Exposition) in Kassel brought him his first significant attention. He earned a doctorate in tensioned constructions in 1954.[1]\n Otto specialised in lightweight tensile and membrane structures, and pioneered advances in structural mathematics and civil engineering.[1] He founded the Institute for Lightweight Structures at the University of Stuttgart in 1964 and headed the institute until his retirement as university professor.[1] Major works include the West German Pavilion at the Montreal Expo in 1967 and the roof of the 1972 Munich Olympic Arena. He has lectured worldwide and taught at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, where he also designed some of the research facilities buildings of the school's forest campus in Hooke Park.[2]\n Until his death, Otto remained active as an architect and engineer, and as consultant to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Mahmoud Bodo Rasch for a number of projects in the Middle East. One of his more recent projects was his work with Shigeru Ban on the Japanese Pavilion at Expo 2000 with a roof structure made entirely of paper, and together with SL Rasch GmbH Special and Lightweight Structures he designed a convertible roof for the Venezuelan Pavilion.[2] In an effort to memorialise the September 11 attacks and its victims as early as 2002, Otto envisioned the two footprints of the World Trade Center buildings covered with water and surrounded by trees; his plan includes a world map embedded in the park with countries at war marked with lights and a continuously updated board announcing the number of people killed in war from 11 September 2001, onward.[3]\n On request of Christoph Ingenhoven, Otto designed the \"Light eyes\" for Stuttgart 21.[4] \u2013 drop-shaped overlights in the park, that descend onto the tracks to support the ceiling.[5][6] Otto remarked in 2010 that the construction should be stopped because of the difficult geology.[7][8]\n Otto died on 9 March 2015; he was to be publicly announced as the winner of the 2015 Pritzker Prize on 23 March but his death meant the committee announced his award on 10 March.[9][10] Otto himself had been told earlier that he had won the prize by the executive director of the Pritzker Prize, Martha Thorne. He was reported to have said, \"I\u2019ve never done anything to gain this prize. Prize winning is not the goal of my life. I try to help poor people, but what shall I say here \u2014 I'm very happy.\"[10]\n This is a partial list of buildings designed by Otto:[10]\n ", "tags": ["1925 births", "2015 deaths", "German World War II pilots", "People from Chemnitz", "Structural engineers", "Tensile architecture", "High-tech architecture", "Tensile membrane structures", "Washington University in St. Louis faculty", "Studienstiftung alumni", "Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "Recipients of the Order of Merit of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg", "Pritzker Architecture Prize winners", "Recipients of the Royal Gold Medal", "Wolf Prize in Arts laureates", "Recipients of the Praemium Imperiale", "Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin", "20th-century German architects", "Use dmy dates from March 2015", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nFrei OttoBornFrei Paul Otto(1925-05-31)31 May 1925Siegmar, GermanyDied9 March 2015(2015-03-09) (aged\u00a089)Warmbronn, GermanyNationalityGermanOccupationArchitect\nFrei Paul Otto (German: [\u02c8f\u0281a\u026a \u02c8\u0294\u0254to]; 31 May 1925 \u2013 9 March 2015) was a German architect and structural engineer noted for his use of lightweight structures, in particular tensile and membrane structures, including the roof of the Olympic Stadium in Munich for the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nOtto won the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 2006 and was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2015, shortly before his death.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 List of buildings\n4 Awards (selected)\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 Further reading\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nOtto was born in Siegmar, Germany, and grew up in Berlin.
