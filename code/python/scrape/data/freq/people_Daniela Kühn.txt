In these graphs the appropriate generalizations of cycles and spanning trees hinge on a proper treatment of the ends of the graph. Reviewer R. Bruce Richter writes that \"the results are extremely satisfactory, in the sense that standard theorems for finite graphs have perfect analogues\" but that \"there is nothing simple about any aspect of this work. It is a nice mix of graph-theoretic and topological ideas.\"[4]\n In 2011, K\u00fchn and her co-authors published a proof of Sumner's conjecture, that every n-vertex polytree forms a subgraph of every (2n\u00a0\u2212\u00a02)-vertex tournament, for all but finitely many values of\u00a0n. MathSciNet reviewer K. B. Reid wrote that their proof \"is an important and welcome development in tournament theory\".[5]\n In 2002, K\u00fchn won the Richard Rado Prize, a biennial best dissertation award given by the Section for Discrete Mathematics of the German Mathematical Society.[6] Together with Deryk Osthus and Alain Plagne, she was one of the first winners of the European Prize in Combinatorics in 2003.[7] Together with Osthus, she was a recipient of the 2014 Whitehead Prize of the London Mathematical Society for \"their many results in extremal graph theory and related areas.
