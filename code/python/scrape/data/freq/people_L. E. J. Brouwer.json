E. J. Brouwer but known to his friends as Bertus, was a Dutch mathematician and philosopher, who worked in topology, set theory, measure theory and complex analysis.[2][4][5] He is known as the founder of modern topology,[6] particularly for establishing his fixed-point theorem and the topological invariance of dimension.[7]\n Brouwer also became a major figure in the philosophy of intuitionism, a constructivist school of mathematics in which math is argued to be a cognitive construct rather than a type of objective truth. This position led to the Brouwer\u2013Hilbert controversy, in which Brouwer sparred with his formalist colleague David Hilbert. Brouwer's ideas were subsequently taken up by his student Arend Heyting and Hilbert's former student Hermann Weyl.\n Early in his career, Brouwer proved a number of theorems in the emerging field of topology. The most important were his fixed point theorem, the topological invariance of degree, and the topological invariance of dimension. Among mathematicians generally, the best known is the first one, usually referred to now as the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem. It is a simple corollary to the second, concerning the topological invariance of degree, which is the best known among algebraic topologists. The third theorem is perhaps the hardest.\n Brouwer also proved the simplicial approximation theorem in the foundations of algebraic topology, which justifies the reduction to combinatorial terms, after sufficient subdivision of simplicial complexes, of the treatment of general continuous mappings. In 1912, at age 31, he was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[8] He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1908 at Rome[9] and in 1912 at Cambridge, UK.[10]\n Brouwer founded intuitionism, a philosophy of mathematics that challenged the then-prevailing formalism of David Hilbert and his collaborators, who included Paul Bernays, Wilhelm Ackermann, and John von Neumann (cf. Kleene (1952), p.\u00a046\u201359). A variety of constructive mathematics, intuitionism is a philosophy of the foundations of mathematics.[11] It is sometimes and rather simplistically characterized by saying that its adherents refuse to use the law of excluded middle in mathematical reasoning.\n Brouwer was a member of the Significs Group. It formed part of the early history of semiotics\u2014the study of symbols\u2014around Victoria, Lady Welby in particular. The original meaning of his intuitionism probably can not be completely disentangled from the intellectual milieu of that group.\n In 1905, at the age of 24, Brouwer expressed his philosophy of life in a short tract Life, Art and Mysticism, which has been described by the mathematician Martin Davis as \"drenched in romantic pessimism\" (Davis (2002), p.\u00a094). Arthur Schopenhauer had a formative influence on Brouwer, not least because he insisted that all concepts be fundamentally based on sense intuitions.[12][13][14] Brouwer then \"embarked on a self-righteous campaign to reconstruct mathematical practice from the ground up so as to satisfy his philosophical convictions\"; indeed his thesis advisor refused to accept his Chapter II \"as it stands, ... all interwoven with some kind of pessimism and mystical attitude to life which is not mathematics, nor has anything to do with the foundations of mathematics\" (Davis, p.\u00a094 quoting van Stigt, p.\u00a041). Nevertheless, in 1908:\n \"After completing his dissertation, Brouwer made a conscious decision to temporarily keep his contentious ideas under wraps and to concentrate on demonstrating his mathematical prowess\" (Davis (2000), p.\u00a095); by 1910 he had published a number of important papers, in particular the Fixed Point Theorem. Hilbert\u2014the formalist with whom the intuitionist Brouwer would ultimately spend years in conflict\u2014admired the young man and helped him receive a regular academic appointment (1912) at the University of Amsterdam (Davis, p.\u00a096). It was then that \"Brouwer felt free to return to his revolutionary project which he was now calling intuitionism \" (ibid).\n He was combative as a young man. He was involved in a very public and eventually demeaning controversy in the later 1920s with Hilbert over editorial policy at Mathematische Annalen, at that time a leading learned journal. He became relatively isolated; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student Arend Heyting.\n Dutch mathematician and historian of mathematics, Bartel Leendert van der Waerden attended lectures given by Brouwer in later years, and commented: \"Even though his most important research contributions were in topology, Brouwer never gave courses in topology, but always on\u2014and only on\u2014the foundations of his intuitionism. It seemed that he was no longer convinced of his results in topology because they were not correct from the point of view of intuitionism, and he judged everything he had done before, his greatest output, false according to his philosophy.\"[15]\n About his last years, Davis (2002) remarks:\n ", "tags": ["1881 births", "1966 deaths", "20th-century Dutch mathematicians", "20th-century Dutch non-fiction writers", "20th-century Dutch philosophers", "20th-century essayists", "20th-century mathematicians", "20th-century philosophers", "Dutch essayists", "Dutch logicians", "Dutch male writers", "Dutch philosophers", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Intuitionism", "Mathematical analysts", "Mathematical logicians", "Members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences", "People from Rotterdam", "Philosophers of logic", "Philosophers of mathematics", "Road incident deaths in the Netherlands", "Set theorists", "Topologists", "University of Amsterdam alumni", "University of Amsterdam faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BPN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Dutch mathematician and logician\nL.

Nevertheless, in 1908:\n\n\"... Brouwer, in a paper entitled 'The untrustworthiness of the principles of logic', challenged the belief that the rules of the classical logic, which have come down to us essentially from Aristotle (384--322 B.C.) have an absolute validity, independent of the subject matter to which they are applied\" (Kleene (1952), p. 46).\n\"After completing his dissertation, Brouwer made a conscious decision to temporarily keep his contentious ideas under wraps and to concentrate on demonstrating his mathematical prowess\" (Davis (2000), p.\u00a095); by 1910 he had published a number of important papers, in particular the Fixed Point Theorem.

He was killed in 1966 at the age of 85, struck by a vehicle while crossing the street in front of his house.\" (Davis, p. 100 quoting van Stigt. p. 110.)\nBibliography[edit]\nIn English translation[edit]\nJean van Heijenoort, 1967 3rd printing 1976 with corrections, A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931.

Brouwer: \"On the significance of the principle of excluded middle in mathematics, especially in function theory.\" With two Addenda and corrigenda, 334-45. Brouwer gives brief synopsis of his belief that the law of excluded middle cannot be \"applied without reservation even in the mathematics of infinite systems\" and gives two examples of failures to illustrate his assertion.\n1925. A. N. Kolmogorov: \"On the principle of excluded middle\", pp.\u00a0414\u2013437. Kolmogorov supports most of Brouwer's results but disputes a few; he discusses the ramifications of intuitionism with respect to \"transfinite judgements\", e.g. transfinite induction.\n1927. L. E.

David Hilbert: \"The foundations of mathematics,\"  464-80\n1927. L. E. J. Brouwer: \"Intuitionistic reflections on formalism,\" 490-92. Brouwer lists four topics on which intuitionism and formalism might \"enter into a dialogue.\" Three of the topics involve the law of excluded middle.\n1927. Hermann Weyl: \"Comments on Hilbert's second lecture on the foundations of mathematics,\" 480-484. In 1920 Weyl, Hilbert's prize pupil, sided with Brouwer against Hilbert.
