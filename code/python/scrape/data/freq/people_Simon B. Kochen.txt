Since 1967 he has been a member of Princeton's Department of Mathematics.

Kochen and Ax also co-authored the Ax\u2013Kochen theorem, an application of model theory to algebra.[5]\n In 1967 Kochen and Ernst Specker proved the Kochen\u2013Specker theorem in quantum mechanics and quantum contextuality.[6]  In 2004 Kochen and John Horton Conway proved the free will theorem.
