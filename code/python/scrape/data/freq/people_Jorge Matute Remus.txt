{"name": "Jorge Matute Remus", "content": "Jorge Matute (February 17, 1912 \u2013 July 6, 2002) was a Mexican engineer.\n His movement of a 1700-ton Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico (Mexican telecommunications) building in 1950 to widen a main street (Avenue Juarez) in Guadalajara earned him a place in the city's history. The building was moved 12 meters away from its original position with all the communication operators working inside. At 23 he designed and built a bridge for a federal Mexican road over Coy river in the Huasteca during a professional internship that gained him respect among engineers at such early stage of his life. He dedicated much of his life to the pursuit of a better urban planning, the provision of water for the city and the improvement of higher education. Matute was dean of the Universidad de Guadalajara (1949\u20131953) and municipal president (1953\u20131955) of the same city. He was given several honors by the University of Guadalajara (Masters and Doctoral (2006) Honoris Causa), UNESCO, the National Prize for Engineering, the French Academic Palms, among others.\n Matute Remus was born in Guadalajara, the son of Juan Matute Gil and Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n Remus and second of five children. In his early years he had to work to help the household economy due to impoverishment caused by the Mexican revolution. In 1941 he married Esmeralda Villase\u00f1or y Villase\u00f1or and had four children: Juan Jorge, Elena, Esmeralda and Pedro.\n The city of Guadalajara needed several modernization works and the state governor of Jalisco at the time, Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Gallo, was dedicating plenty of attention to these changes. The broadening of Vallarta Avenue (a major avenue connecting Guadalajara's downtown to the west) was included. Buildings along the avenue were demolished, except for the telecommunications building, which would have left the city without telephone service for at least a week. At this situation, Jorge Matute, then dean of the city's university (Mexico's second-largest in student population), proposed to move the building 12 meters with all the workers inside and functioning as normal in order to keep the telephone service working. The works started with a budget of only $100,000 USD, only 17% of the cost of demolishing the building and constructing a new one. In order to gain the trust of the employees he asked his wife to enter the building while the movement was taking place. On October 28, 1950 the building was set on its final position, where it still stands with a statue of Matute pushing the building.\n Matute Remus Bridge\n ", "tags": ["1912 births", "2002 deaths", "Mexican civil engineers", "Municipal presidents of Guadalajara, Jalisco", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": " Statue of Jorge Matute Remus \"pushing\" back the Telmex building to save it from the widening of Avenida Juarez in Guadalajara.\nJorge Matute (February 17, 1912 \u2013 July 6, 2002) was a Mexican engineer.\nHis movement of a 1700-ton Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico (Mexican telecommunications) building in 1950 to widen a main street (Avenue Juarez) in Guadalajara earned him a place in the city's history.
