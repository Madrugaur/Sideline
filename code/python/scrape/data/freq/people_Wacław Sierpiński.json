{"name": "Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski", "content": "Wac\u0142aw Franciszek Sierpi\u0144ski (Polish:\u00a0[\u02c8vat\u0361swaf fra\u0272\u02c8t\u0361\u0255i\u0282\u025bk \u0255\u025br\u02c8pij\u0303sk\u02b2i] (listen); 14 March 1882 \u2013 21 October 1969) was a Polish mathematician. He was known for contributions to set theory (research on the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis), number theory, theory of functions and topology. He published over 700 papers and 50 books.\n Three well-known fractals are named after him (the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet and the Sierpi\u0144ski curve), as are Sierpi\u0144ski numbers and the associated Sierpi\u0144ski problem.\n Sierpi\u0144ski enrolled in the Department of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Warsaw in 1899 and graduated four years later. In 1903, while still at the University of Warsaw, the Department of Mathematics and Physics offered a prize for the best essay from a student on Voronoy's contribution to number theory. Sierpi\u0144ski was awarded a gold medal for his essay, thus laying the foundation for his first major mathematical contribution. Unwilling for his work to be published in Russian, he withheld it until 1907, when it was published in Samuel Dickstein's mathematical magazine 'Prace Matematyczno-Fizyczne' (Polish: 'The Works of Mathematics and Physics').\n After his graduation in 1904, Sierpi\u0144ski worked as a school teacher of mathematics and physics in Warsaw. However, when the school closed because of a strike, Sierpi\u0144ski decided to go to Krak\u00f3w to pursue a doctorate. At the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w he attended lectures by Stanis\u0142aw Zaremba on mathematics. He also studied astronomy and philosophy. He received his doctorate and was appointed to the University of Lw\u00f3w in 1908.\n In 1907 Sierpi\u0144ski first became interested in set theory when he came across a theorem which stated that points in the plane could be specified with a single coordinate. He wrote to Tadeusz Banachiewicz (then at G\u00f6ttingen), asking how such a result was possible. He received the one-word reply 'Cantor'. Sierpi\u0144ski began to study set theory and, in 1909, he gave the first ever lecture course devoted entirely to the subject.\n Sierpi\u0144ski maintained an output of research papers and books. During the years 1908 to 1914, when he taught at the University of Lw\u00f3w, he published three books in addition to many research papers. These books were  The Theory of Irrational Numbers (1910), Outline of Set Theory (1912), and The Theory of Numbers (1912).\n When World War I began in 1914, Sierpi\u0144ski and his family were in Russia. To avoid the persecution that was common for Polish foreigners, Sierpi\u0144ski spent the rest of the war years in Moscow working with Nikolai Luzin. Together they began the study of analytic sets. In 1916, Sierpi\u0144ski gave the first example of an absolutely normal number.\n When World War I ended in 1918, Sierpi\u0144ski returned to Lw\u00f3w. However shortly after taking up his appointment again in Lw\u00f3w he was offered a post at the University of Warsaw, which he accepted. In 1919 he was promoted to a professor. He spent the rest of his life in Warsaw.\n During the Polish\u2013Soviet War (1919\u20131921), Sierpi\u0144ski helped break Soviet Russian ciphers for the Polish General Staff's cryptological agency.\n In 1920, Sierpi\u0144ski, together with Zygmunt Janiszewski and his former student Stefan Mazurkiewicz, founded the mathematical journal Fundamenta Mathematicae. Sierpi\u0144ski edited the journal, which specialized in papers on set theory.\n During this period, Sierpi\u0144ski worked predominantly on set theory, but also on point set topology and functions of a real variable. In set theory he made contributions on the axiom of choice and on the continuum hypothesis. He proved that Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory together with the Generalized continuum hypothesis imply the Axiom of choice. He also worked on what is now known as the Sierpi\u0144ski curve. Sierpi\u0144ski continued to collaborate with Luzin on investigations of analytic and projective sets. His work on functions of a real variable includes results on functional series, differentiability of functions and Baire's classification.\n Sierpi\u0144ski retired in 1960 as professor at the University of Warsaw, but continued until 1967 to give a seminar on the Theory of Numbers at the Polish Academy of Sciences. He also continued editorial work as editor-in-chief of Acta Arithmetica, and as a member of the editorial board of Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo, Composito Matematica, and Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Mathematik.\n In 1964 he was one of the signatories of the so-called Letter of 34 to Prime Minister J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz regarding freedom of culture.\n Sierpi\u0144ski is interred at the Pow\u0105zki Cemetery in Warsaw, Poland.\n Honorary Degrees: Lw\u00f3w (1929), St. Marks of Lima (1930), Amsterdam (1931), Tarta (1931), Sofia (1939), Prague (1947), Wroc\u0142aw (1947), Lucknow (1949), and Moscow (1967).\n For high involvement with the development of mathematics in Poland, Sierpi\u0144ski was honored with election to the Polish Academy of Learning in 1921 and that same year was made dean of the faculty at the University of Warsaw. In 1928, he became vice-chairman of the Warsaw Scientific Society, and that same year was elected chairman of the Polish Mathematical Society.\n He was elected to the Geographic Society of Lima (1931), the Royal Scientific Society of Li\u00e8ge (1934), the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (1936), the National Academy of Lima (1939), the Royal Society of Sciences of Naples (1939), the Accademia dei Lincei of Rome (1947), the Germany Academy of Sciences (1950), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1959), the Paris Academy (1960), the Royal Dutch Academy (1961),[1] the Academy of Science of Brussels (1961), the London Mathematical Society (1964), the Romanian Academy (1965) and the Papal Academy of Sciences (1967).\n In 1949 Sierpi\u0144ski was awarded Poland's Scientific Prize, first degree.\n Sierpi\u0144ski authored 724 papers and 50 books, mostly in Polish. His book Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers was originally published in English in 1958. Two books, Introduction to General Topology (1934) and General Topology (1952) were translated into English by Canadian mathematician Cecilia Krieger.\nAnother book, Pythagorean Triangles (1954), was translated into English by Indian mathematician Ambikeshwar Sharma, published in 1962, and republished by Dover Books in 2003; it also has a Russian translation.[2] Another work of his published in English is the Elementary Theory of Numbers (translated by A.
