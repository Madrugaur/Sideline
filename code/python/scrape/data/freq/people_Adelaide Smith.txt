In 1894 she became a science teacher at the National Park Seminary in Maryland, while continuing to study mathematics through the Columbian University, now part of George Washington University.[7] In 1897, Smith took a position as the chair for modern languages at Alma College in Michigan.[8] By 1899, she was listed as \"acting professor of mathematics\" at the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts.[9]\n In 1899, funded by the Women's Education Association[10] and an Association of Collegiate Alumnae European Fellowship,[2] Smith traveled to the University of G\u00f6ttingen for advanced study in mathematics.[11] She stayed in G\u00f6ttingen for \u200b2\u00a01\u20442 years, and then moved to South Africa to teach at Huguenot College, at that time \"the only institution for women south of the equator\".[12] While \"teaching advanced mathematics\" at Huguenot College,[10] she earned a second bachelor's degree in 1905 at the University of the Cape of Good Hope.[4][13]\n She wrote about her travels in two books with a fellow American traveler, Jennie R.
