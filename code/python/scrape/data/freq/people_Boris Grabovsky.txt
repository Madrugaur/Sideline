A historian and ethnographer Boris Golender (\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440 in Russian) in his video lecture described in details where and how the inventor Boris Grabovsky demonstrated a first fully electronic TV set to committee and public in summer 1928.[3] Although this date of demonstration of the fully electronic TV set is the earliest known so far, most of the modern historians claim that either Vladimir Zworykin [4] or Philo Farnsworth [5] were supposedly first. Contribution made by Boris Grabovsky to the development of early television was acknowledged by the Government of the USSR and in 1964 he was awarded a prestigious degree 'Honorable Inventor of the UzSSR'.\n Boris Grabovsky was born in 1901 in Tobolsk, Siberia, where his father, a prominent Ukrainian poet Pavlo Hrabovsky was living in exile as a member of the Russian revolutionary movement Narodnaya Volya. After the death of his father the next year, the family moved to Odessa then to Kharkov. In 1917, they had to move to Central Asia, to Kyrgyz village Tokmak. He died in January 1966 in Frunze.\n Boris Grabovsky started his education in Tashkent special school. Then he entered preparational faculty of Central Asian University in Tashkent where he worked with Prof. G. Popov. In the university he read articles by Boris Rosing in the field of electronic telescopy. Being excited by the idea of the transmission of images over a distance, he invented the cathode commutator, which was the first prototype of his transmitting tube.\n ", "tags": ["Russian inventors", "Soviet engineers", "20th-century Russian engineers", "Television pioneers", "1901 births", "1966 deaths", "20th-century inventors", "Soviet inventors", "Articles needing additional references from September 2009", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.
