{"name": "Mary Lynn Reed", "content": "Mary Lynn Reed (born 1967)[1] is an American mathematician, intelligence researcher, and short fiction writer. She is Department Head in the School of Mathematical Sciences at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\n Reed is a 1988 graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology.[2] She earned a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1995 from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign. Her dissertation, supervised by William Haboush, was The Frobenius Direct Image of Line Bundles and the Structure of Representations, and concerned representation theory.[3]\n Reed writes that she was \"drawn to writing in one form or another since I was a child\", but that she began submitting her creative writing for publication in approximately 2005.[4]\nIn 2013, she completed a Master of Fine Arts in creative writing at the University of Maryland, College Park.[5] Her MFA thesis, Singularities, was directed by Maud Casey.[6]\n After completing her doctorate, Reed obtained a faculty position at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, but \"it was not her dream job\", and she soon began working with the National Security Agency. In approximately 2000, she left the agency and moved to San Diego to work in the software industry, but returned to work with the agency after the September 11 attacks in 2001. By 2016, she had become the chief of mathematics research at the agency.[5] She has also been president of the Crypto-Mathematics Institute, an association of agency mathematicians.[7]\n In 2019, she moved to the Rochester Institute of Technology as Head of the School of Mathematical Sciences.[8]\n In 2018, the University of Illinois Department of Mathematics Alumni gave Reed their Outstanding Professional Achievement Award.[5][7]\n ", "tags": ["1967 births", "Living people", "Georgia Tech alumni", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign alumni", "University of the Sciences faculty", "University of Maryland, College Park alumni", "National Security Agency people", "Rochester Institute of Technology faculty", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers"], "raw": "Mary Lynn Reed (born 1967)[1] is an American mathematician, intelligence researcher, and short fiction writer.
