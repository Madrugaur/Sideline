He was one of the most prolific mathematicians and producers of mathematical conjectures[2] of the 20th century.[3] He was known both for his social practice of mathematics (he engaged more than 500 collaborators) and for his eccentric lifestyle (Time magazine called him The Oddball's Oddball).[4] He devoted his waking hours to mathematics, even into his later years\u2014indeed, his death came only hours after he solved a geometry problem at a conference in Warsaw.\n Erd\u0151s pursued and proposed problems in discrete mathematics, graph theory, number theory, mathematical analysis, approximation theory, set theory, and probability theory.[5]  Much of his work centered around discrete mathematics, cracking many previously unsolved problems in the field. He championed and contributed to Ramsey theory, which studies the conditions in which order necessarily appears. Overall, his work leaned towards solving previously open problems, rather than developing or exploring new areas of mathematics.\n Erd\u0151s published around 1,500 mathematical papers during his lifetime, a figure that remains unsurpassed.[6] He firmly believed mathematics to be a social activity, living an itinerant lifestyle with the sole purpose of writing mathematical papers with other mathematicians. Erd\u0151s's prolific output with co-authors prompted the creation of the Erd\u0151s number, the number of steps in the shortest path between a mathematician and Erd\u0151s in terms of co-authorships.\n Paul Erd\u0151s was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, on 26 March 1913.[7] He was the only surviving child of Anna (n\u00e9e Wilhelm) and Lajos Erd\u0151s (born as Lajos Engl\u00e4nder).[8][9] His two sisters, aged 3 and 5, both died of scarlet fever a few days before he was born.[10] His parents were both Jewish mathematics teachers. His fascination with mathematics developed early\u2014he was often left home by himself because his father was held captive in Siberia as an Austro-Hungarian POW during 1914\u20131920,[9] causing his mother to have to work long hours to support their household. \n He taught himself to read through mathematics texts that his parents left around in their home. By the age of four, given a person's age, he could calculate in his head how many seconds they had lived.[11] Due to his sisters' deaths, he had a close relationship with his mother, with the two of them reportedly sharing the same bed until he left for college.[12]\n Both of Erd\u0151s's parents were high school mathematics teachers, and Erd\u0151s received much of his early education from them. Erd\u0151s always remembered his parents with great affection. At 16, his father introduced him to two of his lifetime favorite subjects\u2014infinite series and set theory. During high school, Erd\u0151s became an ardent solver of the problems proposed each month in K\u00f6MaL, the Mathematical and Physical Monthly for Secondary Schools.[13] Erd\u0151s entered the University of Budapest at the age of 17.[14] By the time he was 20, he had found a proof for Chebyshev's theorem.[14] In 1934, at the age of 21, he was awarded a doctorate in mathematics.[14] Erd\u0151s's thesis advisor was Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r, who was also the thesis advisor for John von Neumann, George P\u00f3lya, and Paul (P\u00e1l) Tur\u00e1n. Because he was Jewish, Erd\u0151s decided Hungary was dangerous and relocated to the United States.[14] Many members of Erd\u0151s' family, including two of his aunts, two of his uncles, and his father, died in Budapest during the Holocaust. His mother survived in hiding.[14] He was living in America and working at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study at the time.[14][15]\n Described by his biographer, Paul Hoffman, as \"probably the most eccentric mathematician in the world,\" Erd\u0151s spent most of his adult life living out of a suitcase.[16] Except for some years in the 1950s, when he was not allowed to enter the United States based on the pretense that he was a Communist sympathizer, his life was a continuous series of going from one meeting or seminar to another.[16] During his visits, Erd\u0151s expected his hosts to lodge him, feed him, and do his laundry, along with anything else he needed, as well as arrange for him to get to his next destination.[16]\n On 20 September 1996, at the age of 83, he had a heart attack and died while attending a conference in Warsaw.[17] These circumstances were close to the way he wanted to die. He once said,\n I want to be giving a lecture, finishing up an important proof on the blackboard, when someone in the audience shouts out, 'What about the general case?'. I'll turn to the audience and smile, 'I'll leave that to the next generation,' and then I'll keel over. Erd\u0151s never married and had no children.[8] He is buried next to his mother and father in grave 17A-6-29 at Kozma Street Cemetery in Budapest.[18] For his epitaph, he suggested \"I've finally stopped getting dumber.\" (Hungarian: \"V\u00e9gre nem butulok tov\u00e1bb\").[19] His life was documented in the film N is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erd\u0151s, made while he was still alive, and posthumously in the book The Man Who Loved Only Numbers (1998).\n Erd\u0151s' name contains the Hungarian letter \"\u0151\" (\"o\" with double acute accent), but is often incorrectly written as Erdos or Erd\u00f6s either \"by mistake or out of typographical necessity\".[20]\n \u2014 Paul Erd\u0151s[21]\n Possessions meant little to Erd\u0151s; most of his belongings would fit in a suitcase, as dictated by his itinerant lifestyle. Awards and other earnings were generally donated to people in need and various worthy causes. He spent most of his life traveling between scientific conferences, universities and the homes of colleagues all over the world. He earned enough in stipends from universities as a guest lecturer, and from various mathematical awards, to fund his travels and basic needs; money left over he used to fund cash prizes for proofs of \"Erd\u0151s problems\" (see below). He would typically show up at a colleague's doorstep and announce \"my brain is open\", staying long enough to collaborate on a few papers before moving on a few days later. In many cases, he would ask the current collaborator about whom to visit next.\n His colleague Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi said, \"a mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems\",[22] and Erd\u0151s drank copious quantities (this quotation is often attributed incorrectly to Erd\u0151s,[23] but Erd\u0151s himself ascribed it to R\u00e9nyi[24]). After 1971 he also took stimulants, despite the concern of his friends, one of whom (Ron Graham) bet him $500 that he could not stop taking them for a month.[25] Erd\u0151s won the bet, but complained that during his abstinence, mathematics had been set back by a month: \"Before, when I looked at a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas. Now all I see is a blank piece of paper.\"[citation needed] After he won the bet, he promptly resumed his use of Ritalin and Benzedrine.\n He had his own idiosyncratic vocabulary; although an agnostic atheist,[26][27] he spoke of \"The Book\", a visualization of a book in which God had written down the best and most elegant proofs for mathematical theorems.[28] Lecturing in 1985 he said, \"You don't have to believe in God, but you should believe in The Book.\" He himself doubted the existence of God, whom he called the \"Supreme Fascist\" (SF).[29][30] He accused SF of hiding his socks and Hungarian passports, and of keeping the most elegant mathematical proofs to Himself. When he saw a particularly beautiful mathematical proof he would exclaim, \"This one's from The Book!\" This later inspired a book titled Proofs from the Book.\n Other idiosyncratic elements of Erd\u0151s's vocabulary include:[31]\n He gave nicknames to many countries, examples being: the U.S. was \"samland\" (after Uncle Sam),[31] the Soviet Union was \"joedom\" (after Joseph Stalin),[31] and Israel was \"isreal\".[citation needed]\n In 1934, he moved to Manchester, England, to be a guest lecturer. In 1938, he accepted his first American position as a scholarship holder at Princeton University. At this time, he began to develop the habit of traveling from campus to campus. He would not stay long in one place and traveled back and forth among mathematical institutions until his death.\n \nIn 1954, the Immigration and Naturalization Service denied Erd\u0151s, a Hungarian citizen, a re-entry visa into the United States, for reasons that have never been fully explained.[32][failed verification] Teaching at the University of Notre Dame at the time, Erd\u0151s could have chosen to remain in the country. Instead, he packed up and left, albeit requesting reconsideration from the U.S. Immigration Services at periodic intervals.  Hungary at the time was under the Warsaw Pact with the Soviet Union. Although Hungary limited the freedom of its own citizens to enter and exit the country, it gave Erd\u0151s the exclusive privilege of being allowed to enter and exit the country as he pleased in 1956.\n In 1963, the U.S. Immigration Service granted Erd\u0151s a visa, and he resumed including American universities in his teaching and travels. Ten years later, in 1973, the 60-year-old Erd\u0151s voluntarily left Hungary.[33]\n During the last decades of his life, Erd\u0151s received at least fifteen honorary doctorates. He became a member of the scientific academies of eight countries, including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the UK Royal Society.[citation needed] He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977.[34] Shortly before his death, he renounced his honorary degree from the University of Waterloo over what he considered to be unfair treatment of colleague Adrian Bondy.[35][36]\n Erd\u0151s was one of the most prolific publishers of papers in mathematical history, comparable only with Leonhard Euler; Erd\u0151s published more papers, mostly in collaboration with other mathematicians, while Euler published more pages, mostly by himself.[37] Erd\u0151s wrote around 1,525 mathematical articles in his lifetime,[38] mostly with co-authors. He strongly believed in and practiced mathematics as a social activity,[39] having 511 different collaborators in his lifetime.[40]\n In his mathematical style, Erd\u0151s was much more of a \"problem solver\" than a \"theory developer\" (see \"The Two Cultures of Mathematics\"[41] by Timothy Gowers for an in-depth discussion of the two styles, and why problem solvers are perhaps less appreciated). Joel Spencer states that \"his place in the 20th-century mathematical pantheon is a matter of some controversy because he resolutely concentrated on particular theorems and conjectures throughout his illustrious career.\"[42] Erd\u0151s never won the highest mathematical prize, the Fields Medal, nor did he coauthor a paper with anyone who did,[43] a pattern that extends to other prizes.[44] He did win the Wolf Prize, where his contribution is described as \"for his numerous contributions to number theory, combinatorics, probability, set theory and mathematical analysis, and for personally stimulating mathematicians the world over\".[45] In contrast, the works of the three winners after were recognized as \"outstanding\", \"classic\", and \"profound\", and the three before as \"fundamental\" or \"seminal\".\n Of his contributions, the development of Ramsey theory and the application of the probabilistic method especially stand out. Extremal combinatorics owes to him a whole approach, derived in part from the tradition of analytic number theory. Erd\u0151s found a proof for Bertrand's postulate which proved to be far neater than Chebyshev's original one. He also discovered the first elementary proof for the prime number theorem, along with Atle Selberg. However, the circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between Erd\u0151s and Selberg.[46][47] Erd\u0151s also contributed to fields in which he had little real interest, such as topology, where he is credited as the first person to give an example of a totally disconnected topological space that is not zero-dimensional, the Erd\u0151s space.[48]\n Throughout his career, Erd\u0151s would offer payments for solutions to unresolved problems.[49] These ranged from $25 for problems that he felt were just out of the reach of the current mathematical thinking (both his and others), to several thousand dollars for problems that were both difficult to attack and mathematically significant. \n There are thought to be at least a thousand remaining unsolved problems, though there is no official or comprehensive list. The offers remained active despite Erd\u0151s's death; Ronald Graham was the (informal) administrator of solutions, and a solver could receive either an original check signed by Erd\u0151s before his death (for memento only, cannot be cashed) or a cashable check from Graham.[50]\n Perhaps the most mathematically notable of these problems is the Erd\u0151s conjecture on arithmetic progressions:\n If the sum of the reciprocals of a sequence of integers diverges, then the sequence contains arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length. If true, it would solve several other open problems in number theory (although one main implication of the conjecture, that the prime numbers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, has since been proved independently as the Green\u2013Tao theorem). The payment for the solution of the problem is currently worth US$5,000.[51]\n The most familiar problem with an Erd\u0151s prize is likely the Collatz conjecture, also called the 3N\u00a0+\u00a01 problem. Erd\u0151s offered $500 for a solution.\n His most frequent collaborators include Hungarian mathematicians Andr\u00e1s S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy (62 papers) and Andr\u00e1s Hajnal (56 papers), and American mathematician Ralph Faudree (50 papers). Other frequent collaborators were the following:[52]\n For other co-authors of Erd\u0151s, see the list of people with Erd\u0151s number 1 in List of people by Erd\u0151s number.\n Because of his prolific output, friends created the Erd\u0151s number as a tribute. An Erd\u0151s number describes a person's degree of separation from Erd\u0151s himself, based on their collaboration with him, or with another who has their own Erd\u0151s number. Erd\u0151s alone was assigned the Erd\u0151s number of 0 (for being himself), while his immediate collaborators could claim an Erd\u0151s number of 1, their collaborators have Erd\u0151s number at most 2, and so on. Approximately 200,000 mathematicians have an assigned Erd\u0151s number,[53]\nand some have estimated that 90 percent of the world's active mathematicians have an Erd\u0151s number smaller than 8 (not surprising in light of the small world phenomenon). Due to collaborations with mathematicians, many scientists in fields such as physics, engineering, biology, and economics have Erd\u0151s numbers as well.[54]\n Several studies have shown that leading mathematicians tend to have particularly low Erd\u0151s numbers.[55] For example, the roughly 268,000 mathematicians with a known Erd\u0151s number have a median value of 5.[56] In contrast, the median Erd\u0151s number of Fields Medalists is 3.[57] As of 2015, approximately 11,000 mathematicians have an Erd\u0151s number of 2 or less.[58][59] Collaboration distances will necessarily increase over long time scales, as mathematicians with low Erd\u0151s numbers die and become unavailable for collaboration. The American Mathematical Society provides a free online tool to determine the Erd\u0151s number of every mathematical author listed in the Mathematical Reviews catalogue.[60]\n The Erd\u0151s number was most likely first defined by Casper Goffman,[61] an analyst whose own Erd\u0151s number is 2.[62] Goffman published his observations about Erd\u0151s's prolific collaboration in a 1969 article titled \"And what is your Erd\u0151s number?\"[63]\n Jerry Grossman has written that it could be argued that Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron can be considered to have an Erd\u0151s number of 1 because they both autographed the same baseball (for Carl Pomerance) when Emory University awarded them honorary degrees on the same day.[64] Erd\u0151s numbers have also been proposed for an infant, a horse, and several actors.[65]\n Erd\u0151s signed his name \"Paul Erdos P.G.O.M.\" When he became 60, he added \"L.D.\", at 65 \"A.D.\", at 70 \"L.D.\" (again), and at 75 \"C.D.\"\n Erd\u0151s is the subject of at least three books: two biographies (Hoffman's The Man Who Loved Only Numbers and Schechter's My Brain is Open, both published in 1998) and a 2013 children's picture book by Deborah Heiligman (The Boy Who Loved Math: The Improbable Life of Paul Erd\u0151s).[68]\n He is also the subject of George Csicsery's biographical documentary N is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erd\u0151s.[69]\n ", "tags": ["Paul Erd\u0151s", "1913 births", "1996 deaths", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "Mental calculators", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Graph theorists", "Hungarian agnostics", "Hungarian atheists", "Hungarian Jews", "Set theorists", "Highly Cited Researchers", "Jewish atheists", "Jewish agnostics", "Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Number theorists", "Mathematicians from Budapest", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Academics of the Victoria University of Manchester", "Probability theorists", "University of Notre Dame faculty", "Purdue University faculty", "Wolf Prize in Mathematics laureates", "Princeton University faculty", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University alumni", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hungarian-language text", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from July 2017", "All articles with failed verification", "Articles with failed verification from February 2021", "Articles with unsourced statements from August 2020", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian mathematician (1913\u20131996)\nThe native form of this personal name is Erd\u0151s P\u00e1l.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nPaul Erd\u0151sPaul Erd\u0151s in 1992Born(1913-03-26)26 March 1913Budapest, Austria-HungaryDied20 September 1996(1996-09-20) (aged\u00a083)Warsaw, PolandNationalityHungarianAlma\u00a0materRoyal Hungarian P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter UniversityKnown\u00a0forA very large number of results and conjectures (more than 1,500 articles), and a very large number of coauthors (more than 500).AwardsWolf Prize (1983/84)AMS Cole Prize (1951)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsVictoria University of ManchesterPrinceton UniversityPurdue University University of Notre DameHebrew University of JerusalemTechnion \u2013 Israel Institute of TechnologyDoctoral advisorLip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9rDoctoral studentsJoseph KruskalGeorge B.

He would not stay long in one place and traveled back and forth among mathematical institutions until his death.\n\nIn 1954, the Immigration and Naturalization Service denied Erd\u0151s, a Hungarian citizen, a re-entry visa into the United States, for reasons that have never been fully explained.[32][failed verification] Teaching at the University of Notre Dame at the time, Erd\u0151s could have chosen to remain in the country. Instead, he packed up and left, albeit requesting reconsideration from the U.S. Immigration Services at periodic intervals.  Counter-clockwise from left: Erd\u0151s, Fan Chung, and her husband Ronald Graham, Japan 1986\nHungary at the time was under the Warsaw Pact with the Soviet Union. Although Hungary limited the freedom of its own citizens to enter and exit the country, it gave Erd\u0151s the exclusive privilege of being allowed to enter and exit the country as he pleased in 1956.\nIn 1963, the U.S. Immigration Service granted Erd\u0151s a visa, and he resumed including American universities in his teaching and travels. Ten years later, in 1973, the 60-year-old Erd\u0151s voluntarily left Hungary.[33]\nDuring the last decades of his life, Erd\u0151s received at least fifteen honorary doctorates. He became a member of the scientific academies of eight countries, including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the UK Royal Society.[citation needed] He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977.[34] Shortly before his death, he renounced his honorary degree from the University of Waterloo over what he considered to be unfair treatment of colleague Adrian Bondy.[35][36]\n\nMathematical work[edit]\nErd\u0151s was one of the most prolific publishers of papers in mathematical history, comparable only with Leonhard Euler; Erd\u0151s published more papers, mostly in collaboration with other mathematicians, while Euler published more pages, mostly by himself.[37] Erd\u0151s wrote around 1,525 mathematical articles in his lifetime,[38] mostly with co-authors. He strongly believed in and practiced mathematics as a social activity,[39] having 511 different collaborators in his lifetime.[40]\nIn his mathematical style, Erd\u0151s was much more of a \"problem solver\" than a \"theory developer\" (see \"The Two Cultures of Mathematics\"[41] by Timothy Gowers for an in-depth discussion of the two styles, and why problem solvers are perhaps less appreciated). Joel Spencer states that \"his place in the 20th-century mathematical pantheon is a matter of some controversy because he resolutely concentrated on particular theorems and conjectures throughout his illustrious career.\"[42] Erd\u0151s never won the highest mathematical prize, the Fields Medal, nor did he coauthor a paper with anyone who did,[43] a pattern that extends to other prizes.[44] He did win the Wolf Prize, where his contribution is described as \"for his numerous contributions to number theory, combinatorics, probability, set theory and mathematical analysis, and for personally stimulating mathematicians the world over\".[45] In contrast, the works of the three winners after were recognized as \"outstanding\", \"classic\", and \"profound\", and the three before as \"fundamental\" or \"seminal\".\nOf his contributions, the development of Ramsey theory and the application of the probabilistic method especially stand out. Extremal combinatorics owes to him a whole approach, derived in part from the tradition of analytic number theory. Erd\u0151s found a proof for Bertrand's postulate which proved to be far neater than Chebyshev's original one. He also discovered the first elementary proof for the prime number theorem, along with Atle Selberg. However, the circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between Erd\u0151s and Selberg.[46][47] Erd\u0151s also contributed to fields in which he had little real interest, such as topology, where he is credited as the first person to give an example of a totally disconnected topological space that is not zero-dimensional, the Erd\u0151s space.[48]\n\nErd\u0151s' problems[edit]\n Erd\u0151s influenced many young mathematicians. In this 1985 photo taken at the University of Adelaide, Erd\u0151s explains a problem to Terence Tao\u2014who was 10 years old at the time. Tao received the Fields Medal in 2006, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2007.\nThroughout his career, Erd\u0151s would offer payments for solutions to unresolved problems.[49] These ranged from $25 for problems that he felt were just out of the reach of the current mathematical thinking (both his and others), to several thousand dollars for problems that were both difficult to attack and mathematically significant. \nThere are thought to be at least a thousand remaining unsolved problems, though there is no official or comprehensive list. The offers remained active despite Erd\u0151s's death; Ronald Graham was the (informal) administrator of solutions, and a solver could receive either an original check signed by Erd\u0151s before his death (for memento only, cannot be cashed) or a cashable check from Graham.[50]\nPerhaps the most mathematically notable of these problems is the Erd\u0151s conjecture on arithmetic progressions:\n\nIf the sum of the reciprocals of a sequence of integers diverges, then the sequence contains arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length.\nIf true, it would solve several other open problems in number theory (although one main implication of the conjecture, that the prime numbers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, has since been proved independently as the Green\u2013Tao theorem). The payment for the solution of the problem is currently worth US$5,000.[51]\nThe most familiar problem with an Erd\u0151s prize is likely the Collatz conjecture, also called the 3N\u00a0+\u00a01 problem. Erd\u0151s offered $500 for a solution.\n\nCollaborators[edit]\nHis most frequent collaborators include Hungarian mathematicians Andr\u00e1s S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy (62 papers) and Andr\u00e1s Hajnal (56 papers), and American mathematician Ralph Faudree (50 papers).

An Erd\u0151s number describes a person's degree of separation from Erd\u0151s himself, based on their collaboration with him, or with another who has their own Erd\u0151s number. Erd\u0151s alone was assigned the Erd\u0151s number of 0 (for being himself), while his immediate collaborators could claim an Erd\u0151s number of 1, their collaborators have Erd\u0151s number at most 2, and so on. Approximately 200,000 mathematicians have an assigned Erd\u0151s number,[53]\nand some have estimated that 90 percent of the world's active mathematicians have an Erd\u0151s number smaller than 8 (not surprising in light of the small world phenomenon). Due to collaborations with mathematicians, many scientists in fields such as physics, engineering, biology, and economics have Erd\u0151s numbers as well.[54]\nSeveral studies have shown that leading mathematicians tend to have particularly low Erd\u0151s numbers.[55] For example, the roughly 268,000 mathematicians with a known Erd\u0151s number have a median value of 5.[56] In contrast, the median Erd\u0151s number of Fields Medalists is 3.[57] As of 2015, approximately 11,000 mathematicians have an Erd\u0151s number of 2 or less.[58][59] Collaboration distances will necessarily increase over long time scales, as mathematicians with low Erd\u0151s numbers die and become unavailable for collaboration. The American Mathematical Society provides a free online tool to determine the Erd\u0151s number of every mathematical author listed in the Mathematical Reviews catalogue.[60]\nThe Erd\u0151s number was most likely first defined by Casper Goffman,[61] an analyst whose own Erd\u0151s number is 2.[62] Goffman published his observations about Erd\u0151s's prolific collaboration in a 1969 article titled \"And what is your Erd\u0151s number?\"[63]\nJerry Grossman has written that it could be argued that Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron can be considered to have an Erd\u0151s number of 1 because they both autographed the same baseball (for Carl Pomerance) when Emory University awarded them honorary degrees on the same day.[64] Erd\u0151s numbers have also been proposed for an infant, a horse, and several actors.[65]\n\nSignature[edit]\nErd\u0151s signed his name \"Paul Erdos P.G.O.M.\" When he became 60, he added \"L.D.\", at 65 \"A.D.\", at 70 \"L.D.\" (again), and at 75 \"C.D.\"\n\nP.G.O.M. represented \"Poor Great Old Man\"\nThe first L.D. represented \"Living Dead\"\nA.D. represented \"Archaeological Discovery\"\nThe second L.D. represented \"Legally Dead\"\nC.D. represented \"Counts Dead\"[66][67]\nBooks and films about Erd\u0151s[edit]\nErd\u0151s is the subject of at least three books: two biographies (Hoffman's The Man Who Loved Only Numbers and Schechter's My Brain is Open, both published in 1998) and a 2013 children's picture book by Deborah Heiligman (The Boy Who Loved Math: The Improbable Life of Paul Erd\u0151s).[68]\nHe is also the subject of George Csicsery's biographical documentary N is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erd\u0151s.[69]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of topics named after Paul Erd\u0151s\u00a0\u2013 including conjectures, numbers, prizes, and theorems\nBox-making game\nCovering system\nDimension (graph theory)\nEven circuit theorem\nFriendship graph\nMinimum overlap problem\nProbabilistic method\nProbabilistic number theory\nThe Martians (scientists)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Mathematics Genealogy Project\".
