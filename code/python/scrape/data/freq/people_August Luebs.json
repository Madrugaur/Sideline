His early career was as a salesman for the International Harvester Company.\n In the 1930s he perfected a method of measuring fuel requirements in air-conditioning called a degree-day, which represents one degree of variation from a standard average daily temperature. He also developed ratings for oil-heating and gas-heating equipment.\n Luebs died in Lincoln, Nebraska, on September 8, 1989, at age 100.[1]\n \n This article about an American scientist is a stub.
