{"name": "William Arrol", "content": "\n Sir William Arrol (13 February 1839 \u2013 20 February 1913) was a Scottish civil engineer, bridge builder, and Liberal Unionist Party politician.\n The son of a spinner, Arrol was born in Houston, Renfrewshire, and started work in a cotton mill at only 9 years of age. He started training as a blacksmith by age 13, and went on to learn mechanics and hydraulics at night school. In 1863 he joined a company of bridge manufacturers in Glasgow, but by 1872 he had established his own business, the Dalmarnock Iron Works, in the east end of the city.[1] The business evolved to become Sir William Arrol & Co., a large international civil engineering business.[1]\n Projects undertaken by the business under his leadership included the replacement for the Tay Bridge (completed in 1887), the Forth Bridge (completed in 1890) and Tower Bridge (completed in 1894).[1] He was also contracted by the Harland and Wolff Shipyard, Belfast, to construct a large gantry (known as the Arrol Gantry) for the construction of three new super-liners, one of which was called the RMS Titanic.[2]\n Arrol was knighted in 1890,[1] and elected as the Liberal Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for South Ayrshire at the 1895 general election, serving the constituency until 1906.[3] He served as President of The Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland from 1895\u201397. He spent the latter years of his life on his estate at Seafield House, near Ayr,[4] where he died on 20 February 1913.[1] He is buried in Woodside Cemetery, Paisley, on the north side of the main-east west path on the crest of the hill.[5]\n In 2013 he was one of four inductees to the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame.[6] His image is also featured on the Clydesdale Bank \u00a35 note introduced in 2015.[7]\n ", "tags": ["1839 births", "1913 deaths", "People from Renfrewshire", "Bridgeton\u2013Calton\u2013Dalmarnock", "Knights Bachelor", "Presidents of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland", "Scottish engineers", "Scottish civil engineers", "Bridge engineers", "Liberal Unionist Party MPs for Scottish constituencies", "UK MPs 1895\u20131900", "UK MPs 1900\u20131906", "Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame inductees", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from September 2020", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "British politician\n\n\n Portrait of William Arrol\n Bust of William Arrol, People's Palace museum, Glasgow\n Memorial to Sir William Arrol, now on display in the Glasgow People's Palace\nSir William Arrol (13 February 1839 \u2013 20 February 1913) was a Scottish civil engineer, bridge builder, and Liberal Unionist Party politician.\n\nContents\n\n1 Career\n2 Legacy\n3 See also\n4 References\n5 Further reading\n6 External links\n\n\nCareer[edit]\nThe son of a spinner, Arrol was born in Houston, Renfrewshire, and started work in a cotton mill at only 9 years of age.
