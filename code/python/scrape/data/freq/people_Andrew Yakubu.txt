He was given the appointment by President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan in 2012.[1] He and the management team were relieved of their appointments to strengthen the on-going reforms in NNPC by ex-President Goodluck Jonathan on July, 2014 and Joseph Dawha was named as his successor in 2014.[1][2][3]\n Yakubu was born on 10th Sept, 1955 in Mawukili, Northern Region (now in southern Kaduna State), Nigeria. Yakubu is a philanthropist who has contributed to various charity projects in multiple churches and organizations across Nigeria. Over the years he has continually supported the needy by way of donations, sponsorship and scholarships for the poor using his foundation. He was given the chieftaincy title \u201cIya A\u0320tyap\u201d by the Atyap Chiefdom of\nKaduna State in 2004, and is a full member of the Atyap Council of Chiefs.[2][3]\n Yakubu attended the Government College in Keffi from 1969 to 1973, obtaining a West African School Certificate.[4] Thereafter, he attended the College of Arts and Science in Zaria until 1975, when he entered the Ahmadu Bello University there, studying chemical engineering.[1] After graduating with a BA in 1979, he served various roles in refineries before becoming executive director of operations at NETCO in March 2005. In addition to his education in chemistry, he received a certificate in Strategy and Organization from Stanford University's Graduate School of Business Studies. \n He left his NETCO role in December 2006 to work at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, first as general manager and ultimately as managing director and CEO. He assumed the role several months after a national fuel crisis in Nigeria, when the NNPC was widely perceived as a corrupt organization,[4] and oversaw changes within the national institution until he was removed during President Jonathan's regime on allegations of insubordination. Yakubu's intervention led to the gas supply to the Nigerian market growing from 300 million cubic feet per day (mcfpd) to 1500mcfpd, of which 70% was dedicated to support the power sector. He sustained stability in the supply and distribution of petroleum products across the country, with Nigeria's three refineries running efficiently during his tenure.
