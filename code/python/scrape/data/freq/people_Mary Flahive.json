Her dissertation, On The Minima Of Indefinite Binary Quadratic Forms, was supervised by Alan C. Woods,[6] and cites the mentorship of another Ohio State mathematician, Jill Yaqub.

Their study found small differences in hiring at doctorate-granting institutions between men and women, indicating that other points in the career are more critical in explaining the gender gap between men and women in mathematics.[8][9]\n ", "tags": ["1948 births", "Living people", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "St. Joseph's College (New York) alumni", "Ohio State University alumni", "Oregon State University faculty", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "CS1 maint: untitled periodical", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Professor of mathematics\nMary Elizabeth Flahive (born 1948)[1] is a professor of mathematics at Oregon State University.
