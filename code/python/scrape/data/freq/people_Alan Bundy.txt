{"name": "Alan Bundy", "content": "\n Alan Richard Bundy CBE FRS FRSE FREng[4] is a professor at the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh,[5] known for his contributions to automated reasoning, especially to proof planning, the use of meta-level reasoning to guide proof search.[2][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]\n Alan Bundy was educated as a mathematician, obtaining an honours degree in Mathematics in 1968 from the University of Leicester and a PhD in Mathematical Logic in 1971, also from Leicester.[13]\n Since 1971, Bundy has worked at the University of Edinburgh: initially in the 'Metamathematics' Unit, which in 1972 became the Department of Computational Logic, in 1974 was absorbed into the new Department of Artificial Intelligence, and in 1998 was absorbed into the new School of Informatics. From 1971\u201373, he was a research fellow on Prof. B. Meltzer's Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) grant Theorem Proving by Computer; in 1973 he was appointed a university lecturer; in 1984 he was promoted to reader; in 1987 he was promoted to professorial fellow; and in 1990 he was promoted to professor. From 1987\u201392 he held a SERC Senior Fellowship. From 1998\u20132001 he was Head of the newly formed Division (subsequently School) of Informatics at Edinburgh.\n From 2000\u20132005 he was a founder and convener of the UK Computing Research Committee, which plays an advocacy role for computing research in the UK. From 2010 he served as a Vice-President and Trustee of the British Computer Society with special responsibility for the Academy of Computing.[citation needed]\n Bundy was a founding AAAI Fellow in 1990, and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE)  in 1996, a founding fellow of SSAISB in 1997, a founding fellow of European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI) in 1999, a fellow of the British Computer Society in 2004, and a Fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 2005. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng) [4] in 2008. He was elected an ACM Fellow in 2014 \"For contributions to artificial intelligence, automated reasoning, and the formation and evolution of representations.\".[14]\n He is the winner of the 2007 IJCAI Award for Research Excellence and Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automated Deduction.\n He was one of the 41 professors selected worldwide to receive one of the Hewlett Packard Labs Innovation Research Awards 2008.[15]\n \nBundy was appointed CBE in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to computing science.[16] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2012,[17] his certificate of election reads Alan Bundy has made world-leading contributions to both automated reasoning and the automated formation and evolution of representations of knowledge. He has developed novel techniques with improved efficiency, range and behaviour. His work on automated reasoning has found application in hardware and software systems development, where it has increased the level of automation. It has decreased the skill level and development time required to verify computer programs and has been taken up by industry. His work on representation evolution facilitates communication between agencies with different representations of related knowledge.[17] \n ", "tags": ["Artificial intelligence researchers", "British computer scientists", "Fellows of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence", "Academics of the University of Edinburgh", "Alumni of the University of Leicester", "Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering", "Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Fellows of the British Computer Society", "Fellows of the Institution of Engineering and Technology", "Fellows of the SSAISB", "Living people", "1947 births", "Commanders of the Order of the British Empire", "Fellows of the European Association for Artificial Intelligence", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "Pages containing London Gazette template with parameter supp set to y", "EngvarB from September 2014", "Use dmy dates from September 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2019", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For the fictional character, see Al Bundy.\n\n\nAlan BundyCBE FRS FRSE FREngBornAlan Richard Bundy (1947-05-18) 18 May 1947 (age\u00a073)[1]IsleworthNationalityBritishAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Leicester (BSc, PhD)Awards\nAAAI Fellow (1990)\nACM Fellow (2014)\nIJCAI Award (2007)\nHerbrand Award (2007)\nScientific careerFields\nAutomated reasoning\nAutomated theorem proving\nArtificial intelligence\nFormal methods\nOntology evolution[2]\nInstitutionsUniversity of EdinburghThesisThe Metatheory of the Elementary Equation Calculus\u00a0(1971)Doctoral advisorReuben Goodstein[3]Doctoral students\nSimon Colton\nFrank van Harmelen\nLincoln Wallen\nToby Walsh[3]\n\nWebsitehomepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bundy\nAlan Richard Bundy CBE FRS FRSE FREng[4] is a professor at the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh,[5] known for his contributions to automated reasoning, especially to proof planning, the use of meta-level reasoning to guide proof search.[2][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]\n\nContents\n\n1 Education\n2 Career and research\n\n2.1 Honours and awards\n\n\n3 References\n\n\nEducation[edit]\nAlan Bundy was educated as a mathematician, obtaining an honours degree in Mathematics in 1968 from the University of Leicester and a PhD in Mathematical Logic in 1971, also from Leicester.[13]\n\nCareer and research[edit]\nSince 1971, Bundy has worked at the University of Edinburgh: initially in the 'Metamathematics' Unit, which in 1972 became the Department of Computational Logic, in 1974 was absorbed into the new Department of Artificial Intelligence, and in 1998 was absorbed into the new School of Informatics.
