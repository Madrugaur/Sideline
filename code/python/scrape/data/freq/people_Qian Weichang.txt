{"name": "Qian Weichang", "content": "\n Qian Weichang or Chien Wei-zang (simplified Chinese: \u94b1\u4f1f\u957f; traditional Chinese: \u9322\u5049\u9577; pinyin: Qi\u00e1n W\u011bich\u00e1ng; Wade\u2013Giles: Ch'ien Wei-ch'ang; 9 October 1912 \u2013 30 July 2010) was a Chinese physicist and applied mathematician, as well as academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He served as President of Shanghai University.[2]\n Qian was born in Wuxi, Jiangsu, Republic of China on 9 October 1912. His uncle was the famous historian Ch'ien Mu. After graduating from Tsinghua University in 1935, he entered its Graduate School and became an intern researcher at the National Central Research Institute under the guidance of Wu Youxun. He obtained a Ph.D. degree at the University of Toronto under the supervision of John Lighton Synge in 1942, and then worked as a research associate in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of Caltech.\n In 1946, Qian returned to China and served as professor of Tsinghua University, Peking University and Yanjing University. In 1950s, he was Dean of Studies and Vice President of Tsinghua University, Vice Director of the Institute of Mechanics of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Director of the Institute of Automation of CAS, and a member of the Standing Committee of All China Federation of Scientific Societies. He was elected a founding academician of the CAS in 1955 and a foreign academician of the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1956. During the Anti-Rightist Movement, he was denounced as a \"rightist.\"\n In 1982, Qian became President of Shanghai University of Technology, which had been turned into a shambles after the consolidation of 4 institutions of higher education in 1994.\n Qian was Editor-in-Chief of \"Applied Mathematics and Mechanics\", a member of the Editorial Boards of \"International Journal of Engineering Science\"(US), \"Advances in Applied Mechanics\"(US), \"Journal of Thin-walled Structure\"(Holland) and \"Journal of Finite Elements in Analysis and Design\". He had been Vice Chairman of the National Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference since 1987.\n Qian was a specialist in applied mathematics, mechanics, physics, engineering science and Chinese information processing. He was generally acknowledged as one of the pioneers and founders of modern mechanics undertakings in China. His major research activities include; the intrinsic theory of plates and shells, the analysis of large deflection of thin plates and shells, the analysis of corrugated pipes, mechanics of armour penetration, singular perturbation methods, variational principles and generalized variational principles, finite element methods as well as the measurements of atmospheric electricity, spectral analysis of rare-earth elements, wave guide theory, lubrication theory, the development of high-energy batteries, his macro-coding of Chinese characters, etc. The joint work with J. L. Synge on the intrinsic theory of plates and shells is considered as a pioneering classical work in solid mechanics and his successive approximation method of treating large deflection problem is now named as \"Chien's method\". And he initiated a novel singular perturbation method, the method of composite expansions.\n He had published in academic monographs and hundreds of scientific papers. Due to his work on the problems of large deflation of circular elastic plates and the generalized variational principles, he won the State Natural Science Award (Second Class) twice, in 1965 and 1982. He also made great contribution to the engineering applications of sciences, such as the fluttering of airplanes, the design of submarines, armour penetration, the design of instruments and panpipe systems.\n In the early 1980s, Qian worked with Zhou Youguang and Liu Zunqi on creating a Chinese-language edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.[3]\n During his presidency of Shanghai University (formerly Shanghai University of Technology), he devoted himself to the reconstruction of the University and to the accomplishment of reforms in higher education . He believed that the key role of higher education is to bring up excellent new generations with prefect personality and advanced expertise. For this purpose, he laid emphasis on raising the academic level of the University and shows great concerns to the publication of academic journals at the University.[citation needed]\n Qian also served as chairman of the Steering Committee of the Third International Conference on Linear Mechanics in Shanghai in 1998.\n He died in Shanghai at 6:20AM on 30 July 2010 precisely.[4][5]\n ", "tags": ["1912 births", "2010 deaths", "Academic journal editors", "Educators from Wuxi", "Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee members", "Mathematicians from Jiangsu", "Members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences", "People's Republic of China science writers", "Physicists from Jiangsu", "Presidents of universities and colleges in China", "Republic of China science writers", "Scientists from Wuxi", "Shanghai University of Technology faculty", "Tsinghua University faculty", "University of Toronto alumni", "Victims of the Cultural Revolution", "Victims of the Anti-Rightist Campaign", "Vice Chairpersons of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference", "Rare earth scientists", "CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh)", "CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles needing additional references from February 2010", "All articles needing additional references", "Use dmy dates from February 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing simplified Chinese-language text", "Articles containing traditional Chinese-language text", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2010", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.
