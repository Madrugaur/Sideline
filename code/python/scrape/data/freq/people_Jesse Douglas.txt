{"name": "Jesse Douglas", "content": "Jesse Douglas (3 July 1897\u00a0\u2013 7 September 1965) was an American mathematician and Fields Medalist known for his general solution to Plateau's problem.\n He was born to a Jewish family[1] in New York City, the son of Sarah (n\u00e9e Kommel) and Louis Douglas. He attended City College of New York as an undergraduate, graduating with honors in Mathematics in 1916.  He then moved to Columbia University as a graduate student, obtaining a PhD in mathematics in 1920.[2]\n Douglas was one of two winners of the first Fields Medals, awarded in 1936. He was honored for solving, in 1930, the problem of Plateau, which asks whether a minimal surface exists for a given boundary. The problem, open since 1760 when Lagrange raised it, is part of the calculus of variations and is also known as the soap bubble problem. Douglas also made significant contributions to the inverse problem of the calculus of variations. The American Mathematical Society awarded him the B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize in 1943.\n Douglas later became a full professor at the City College of New York (CCNY), where he taught until his death. At the time CCNY only offered undergraduate degrees and Professor Douglas taught the advanced calculus course. Sophomores (and freshmen with advanced placement) were privileged to get their introduction to real analysis from a Fields medalist.\n \n ", "tags": ["1897 births", "1965 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "City College of New York faculty", "Columbia University alumni", "Differential geometers", "Fields Medalists", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Jewish American scientists", "Mathematical analysts", "Mathematicians from New York (state)", "Scientists from New York City", "Variational analysts", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Use dmy dates from April 2017"], "raw": "American differential geometer\nFor the actress, see Jesse Douglas (actress).\nJesse DouglasDouglas in c.\u20091932Born(1897-07-03)July 3, 1897New York City, New York, United StatesDiedSeptember 7, 1965(1965-09-07) (aged\u00a068)New York City, New York, United StatesAlma\u00a0materCity College of New YorkColumbia UniversityKnown\u00a0forSolution to Plateau's problemSpouse(s)Jessie Nayler  \u200b(m.\u00a01940\u2060\u2013\u20601955)\u200bChildrenLewis Philip DouglasAwardsFields Medal (1936)B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize (1943)Scientific careerFieldsCalculus of variations  Differential geometryInstitutionsCity College of New York MITDoctoral advisorEdward Kasner\n\nJesse Douglas (3 July 1897\u00a0\u2013 7 September 1965) was an American mathematician and Fields Medalist known for his general solution to Plateau's problem.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and career\n2 Selected papers\n3 See also\n4 Notes\n5 References\n6 Further reading\n7 External links\n\n\nLife and career[edit]\nHe was born to a Jewish family[1] in New York City, the son of Sarah (n\u00e9e Kommel) and Louis Douglas.
