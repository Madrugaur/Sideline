{"name": "Marie-Louise Michelsohn", "content": "Marie-Louise Michelsohn (born October 8, 1941) is a professor of mathematics at State University of New York at Stony Brook.\n Michelsohn attended the Bronx High School of Science.  She attended the University of Chicago for her undergraduate and graduate studies, including her PhD.\n She spent a year as a visiting professor at University of California at San Diego.  She spent a year l'Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques outside of Paris, France.  She then joined the faculty of State University of New York at Stony Brook.\n Michelsohn's PhD was in the field of topology. As of 2020, she has published twenty articles, on topics including complex geometry, spin manifolds and the Dirac operator, and the theory of algebraic cycles. Half of her work has been in collaboration with Blaine Lawson. With Lawson, she wrote a textbook on spin geometry which has become the standard reference for the field.\n In her most widely-known work, published in 1982, Michelsohn introduced the notion of a balanced metric on a complex manifold. These are hermitian metrics for which the penultimate power of the associated K\u00e4hler form is closed, i.e.\n in which \u03c9 is the K\u00e4hler form and n is the complex dimension. It is trivial to see that every K\u00e4hler metric is a balanced metric. As for K\u00e4hler metrics, the above definition of a balanced metric automatically places cohomological restrictions on the underlying manifold; by Stokes' theorem, every codimension-one complex subvariety is homologically nontrivial. For instance, the Calabi-Eckmann complex manifolds do not support any balanced metrics. Michelsohn also recast the definition of a balanced metric in terms of the torsion tensor and in terms of the Dirac operator. In parallel to a work of Reese Harvey and Blaine Lawson's on K\u00e4hler metrics, Michelsohn obtained a full characterization, in terms of the cohomological theory of currents, of which complex manifolds admit balanced metrics.\n Balanced metrics are, in part, of interest due to their role in the Strominger system arising from string theory.\n Michelsohn is also an accomplished middle and long-distance runner.  She holds five masters athletics world records including through three age divisions of the 2000 metres steeplechase which she has held since 2002.[1]  In addition to the world records, she holds 6 more outdoor American records and 10 indoor American records, running the table of all official indoor distances 800 metres and above in both the W65 and W70 divisions.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1941 births", "American women mathematicians", "Living people", "21st-century American mathematicians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\n Michelsohn in 1982\nMarie-Louise Michelsohn (born October 8, 1941) is a professor of mathematics at State University of New York at Stony Brook.\n\nContents\n\n1 Education\n2 Mathematical work\n3 Masters athletics\n4 Notable publications\n5 Notes\n6 References\n\n\nEducation[edit]\nMichelsohn attended the Bronx High School of Science.
