He is Chairman of the Edinburgh and Lothian's Regional Equality Council. He is one of the founding directors and the Vice Chair of the Edinburgh Mela. He is also Chairman of the Bangladesh Samity Edinburgh.\n Choudhury was born in the village of Badardi, Bausha Union, Nabiganj, Habiganj, Sylhet District, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh),[1] and grew up in Edinburgh, Scotland.[2]\n Choudhury's parents are the late Al-Haj Gulam Rabbani Choudhury and Rukeya Rabbani Choudhury. He is eldest of six siblings, he has one brother and five sisters.[1] In 1982, his father came and settled in Edinburgh. Choudhury's uncle is businessman Wali Tasar Uddin.[3]\n During his time studying at the University of Edinburgh, Choudhury took responsibility for his ailing father's business. He expanded the business and is now an entrepreneur with interests in catering, hospitality, finance and real estate across the United Kingdom and Bangladesh.[1]\n Choudhury is a community activist in the UK. He has worked with the Scottish Government and various councils to improve community relations. He has played a leading role in several charities.[1]\n He has been involved with the Edinburgh and Lothian's Regional Equality Council (ELREC) since he was a teenager and has been an active campaigner for equality and good race and interfaith relations in Scotland. He has served the ELREC as a Trustee, company secretary, Vice Chair and he is currently its chairman. Choudhury has led the organisation through its transition from the race equality council to a pan-equalities regional council.[1][4][5][6] In 2013, he was re-elected for a fourth term.[3]\n In 1991,[3] Choudhury co-founded the Edinburgh Mela[3] and is currently its vice-chair.

However, he was not elected and finished in third place with 13,213 votes.[7]\n On 11 June 2019, an article in the Edinburgh Evening News reported criticism of Mr Choudhury by an employment tribunal. The tribunal, brought by former Mela director Chris Purnell, found that evidence given by Mr Choudhury was unsatisfactory. The tribunal said Mr Purnell had given his evidence \u201cin a straightforward and measured way\u201d and it was \u201centirely credible\u201d. It added: \u201cIn contrast, the manner in which Mr Khan and Mr Choudhury gave their evidence was often unsatisfactory. Both showed a reluctance to answer simple questions directly.\u201d\n The tribunal awarded Mr Purnell \u00a367,000 after it found he was unfairly dismissed from his role of director of the Mela festival, of which Mr Choudhury was vice-chair. Mr Purnell alleged that Mr Choudhury told him he should \u201cwatch himself\u201d and \u201cremember who pays his wages\u201d. And he said Mr Choudhury also criticised his body language and told him \u201cdirectors come and go\u201d and that he should not be taking credit for the success of the Mela and \u201cacting as if he was doing the board a favour\u201d.\n The 2016 Mela was cancelled but the festival went ahead in scaled-back form in 2017 and 2018. The council has invited tenders to run a multicultural event in the summer of 2019.\n In 2004, Choudhury was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2004 New Year Honours[3] for his services to the community.[1] In 2006, he was awarded from the Channel S Award for his outstanding role as community worker and leader.[3]\n Choudhury is married Tahmina (Moni) Choudhury[1]\n Choudhury is involved in fundraising campaigns, raising over a quarter of a million pounds for causes including Bangladesh Cyclone Appeal in Scotland, St Colombia's Hospice, Leukaemia and Cancer appeal, Sick Kids appeal, British Heart Foundation and many others. In addition to this he is also one of the organisers who built two shelter and 40 houses for the survivors of Cyclone Sidr Bangladesh in 2010.[1]\n ", "tags": ["1969 births", "Living people", "British Muslims", "Bangladeshi emigrants to England", "British people of Bangladeshi descent", "Naturalised citizens of the United Kingdom", "British activists", "British restaurateurs", "Scottish Labour Party parliamentary candidates", "People from Nabiganj Upazila", "Businesspeople from Edinburgh", "Alumni of the University of Edinburgh", "Members of the Order of the British Empire", "EngvarB from February 2017", "Use dmy dates from August 2019", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Bengali-language text"], "raw": "\n\nFoysol Hussain ChoudhuryMBE\u09ab\u09af\u09bc\u099b\u09b2 \u09b9\u09cb\u09b8\u09c7\u09a8 \u099a\u09cc\u09a7\u09c2\u09b0\u09c0Born (1969-01-05) 5 January 1969 (age\u00a052)Badardi, Bausha, Nabiganj, Habiganj, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh)NationalityBritishOccupationBusinessmanYears\u00a0active1991\u2013presentKnown\u00a0forPolitics and community relationsHeight5\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (168\u00a0cm)TitleChairman of Edinburgh and Lothian's Regional Equality CouncilPolitical partyLabourSpouse(s)Tahmina Choudhury (Moni)Children2Parent(s)Al-Haj Gulam Rabbani Choudhury (father)Rukeya Rabbani Choudhury (mother)RelativesRipa Kadir (sister)Muffazal Choudhury (brother)Rema Choudhury (sister)Sheema Rahman (sister)Eipa Choudhury (sister)Wali Tasar Uddin (uncle)\nFoysol Hussain Choudhury, MBE (Bengali: \u09ab\u09af\u09bc\u099b\u09b2 \u09b9\u09cb\u09b8\u09c7\u09a8 \u099a\u09cc\u09a7\u09c2\u09b0\u09c0; born 5 January 1969) is a Bangladeshi-born British businessman.
