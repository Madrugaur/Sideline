At the University of Alaska, she is a professor of mathematics, the head of the department of mathematics and statistics, and was the interim dean of the College of Natural Science and Mathematics.[1] She is also a member of the borough assembly of Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska.\n Berman's research involves discrete geometry, and in particular the geometry of configurations of points and lines. Her discoveries in this area have included the construction of the first known movable configurations with four points per line and four lines through each point.[2] With another mathematician at the University of Alaska, Jill Faudree, she has developed methods for constructing highly symmetric configurations with as many as six points per line and six lines through each point.[3]\n Berman was born in 1976 in St. Louis.[4] She is the daughter of Harry J.
