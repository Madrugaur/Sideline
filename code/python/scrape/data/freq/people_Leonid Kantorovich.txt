He is regarded as the founder of linear programming. He was the winner of the Stalin Prize in 1949 and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1975.\n Kantorovich was born on 19 January 1912, to a Russian Jewish family.[1] His father was a doctor practicing in Saint Petersburg.[2] In 1926, at the age of fourteen, he began his studies at the Leningrad University. He graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics in 1930, and began his graduate studies. In 1934, at the age of 22 years, he became a full professor.\n Later, Kantorovich worked for the Soviet government. He was given the task of optimizing production in a plywood industry. He came up with the mathematical technique now known as linear programming in 1939, some years before it was advanced by George Dantzig. He authored several books including The Mathematical Method of Production Planning and Organization (Russian original 1939), The Best Uses of Economic Resources (Russian original 1959), and, with Vladimir Ivanovich Krylov, Approximate methods of higher analysis (Russian original 1936).[3] For his work, Kantorovich was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1949.\n \nAfter 1939, he became the professor of Military Engineering-Technical University. During the Siege of Leningrad, Kantorovich was the professor of VITU of Navy and in charge of safety on the Road of Life. He calculated the optimal distance between cars on ice, depending on thickness of ice and temperature of the air. In December 1941 and January 1942, Kantorovich personally walked between cars driving on the ice of Lake Ladoga, on the Road of Life, to ensure the cars did not sink. However, many cars with food for survivors of the siege were destroyed by the German airstrikes. In 1948 Kantorovich was  assigned to the atomic project of the USSR. For his feat and courage Kantorovich was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War, and was decorated with the medal For Defense of Leningrad.  After 1960, Kantorovich lived and worked in Novosibirsk, where he created and took charge of the Department of Computational Mathematics in Novosibirsk State University.[4]\n The Nobel Memorial Prize, which he shared with Tjalling Koopmans, was given \"for their contributions to the theory of optimum allocation of resources.\"\n In mathematical analysis, Kantorovich had important results in functional analysis, approximation theory, and operator theory.\n In particular, Kantorovich formulated fundamental results in the theory of normed vector lattices, which are called \"K-spaces\" in his honor.\n Kantorovich showed that functional analysis could be used in the analysis of iterative methods, obtaining the Kantorovich inequalities on the convergence rate of the gradient method and of Newton's method (see the Kantorovich theorem).\n Kantorovich considered infinite-dimensional optimization problems, such as the Kantorovich-Monge problem in transportation theory. His analysis proposed the Kantorovich metric, which is used in probability theory, in the theory of the weak convergence of probability measures.\n Portrait by Petrov-Vodkin. 1938.\n 1976\n Original CIA file on Kantorovich, seized from the former US Embassy in Tehran.\n ", "tags": ["1912 births", "1986 deaths", "Nobel laureates in Economics", "Soviet Nobel laureates", "Jewish Nobel laureates", "People from Saint Petersburg", "People from Saint Petersburg Governorate", "Soviet Jews", "Soviet economists", "Soviet mathematicians", "Functional analysts", "Approximation theorists", "Operator theorists", "Operations researchers", "Mathematical economists", "General equilibrium theorists", "Variational analysts", "Saint Petersburg State University alumni", "Military Engineering-Technical University faculty", "Novosibirsk State University faculty", "Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Fellows of the Econometric Society", "Recipients of the Order of Lenin", "Lenin Prize winners", "Stalin Prize winners", "Burials at Novodevichy Cemetery", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox economist as a module", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Articles with hAudio microformats", "Articles with Russian-language sources (ru)", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Russian mathematician\nLeonid KantorovichLeonid Kantorovich in 1975Born(1912-01-19)19 January 1912Saint Petersburg, Russian EmpireDied7 April 1986(1986-04-07) (aged\u00a074)Moscow, Russian SFSR, USSRResting placeNovodevichy Cemetery, MoscowNationalitySovietAlma\u00a0materLeningrad State UniversityKnown\u00a0forLinear programmingKantorovich theorem  normed vector lattice (Kantorovich space)Kantorovich metricKantorovich inequality approximation theoryiterative methodsfunctional analysisnumerical analysisscientific computingAwardsSveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (1975)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUSSR Academy of SciencesLeningrad State UniversityDoctoral advisorGrigorii Fichtenholz  Vladimir SmirnovDoctoral studentsSvetlozar Rachev\nAcademic careerInformation at IDEAS\u00a0/\u00a0RePEc\n\nLeonid Vitaliyevich Kantorovich (Russian: \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0301\u0434 \u0412\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0301\u0432\u0438\u0447, IPA:\u00a0[l\u02b2\u026a\u0250\u02c8n\u02b2it v\u02b2\u026a\u02c8tal\u02b2j\u026av\u02b2\u026at\u0255 k\u0259nt\u0250\u02c8rov\u02b2\u026at\u0255] (listen); 19 January 1912\u00a0\u2013 7 April 1986) was a Soviet mathematician and economist, known for his theory and development of techniques for the optimal allocation of resources.
