Eventually, he studied Fine Arts and Architecture at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France from where he returned to Mexico City in 1879 to practise as an architect and teach at the Schools of Engineering and Architecture (today part of the National Autonomous University of Mexico).\n Among Rivas Mercado's various projects figure the house that eventually became the Wax Museum of Mexico City (1883); the restoration of haciendas of historical importance such as the Hacienda of Tecajete in the State of Hidalgo (1884), and Chapingo in the State of Mexico (1900); the customs building in Tlatelolco, (1884); the restoration of several government buildings including the facade of the Town Hall in Mexico City (1887); and his own house (1898) in Mexico City, now preserved as a historical building.\n The Teatro Ju\u00e1rez in Guanajuato, which Rivas Mercado built between 1892 and 1903, is considered to be one of the finest buildings of the period. The neoclassical exterior and neo-moorish interior are a clear reflection of his eclectic architectural style. In 1902 he was commissioned by President Porfirio D\u00edaz to design and build the Independence Column on occasion of the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence. The project, which he realised in collaboration with sculptor Enrique Alciati, was finished in 1910, the same year as the anniversary.\n Rivas Mercado was Director of the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes in Mexico City from 1903 to 1912. He instituted new methods of study and design and is said to have modified the curriculum of the \"Architecture and Civil Engineering\" major in order to make two different ones out of it. During his tenure he managed to raise enough money to fund Diego Rivera's scholarship to study painting in Europe. He moved back to Paris shortly after his tenure ended. However, he returned to Mexico in 1926 and died a few months later in Mexico City, aged 74.\n On 26 February 2019, Google celebrated what would have been Mercado's 166th birthday with a Google doodle.[1]\n ", "tags": ["1853 births", "1927 deaths", "Mexican architects", "Mexican civil engineers", "Articles needing additional references from August 2018", "All articles needing additional references", "CS1 maint: extra text: authors list", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.
