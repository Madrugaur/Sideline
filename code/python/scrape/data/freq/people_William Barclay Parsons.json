{"name": "William Barclay Parsons", "content": "\n William Barclay Parsons (April 15, 1859 \u2013 May 9, 1932) was an American civil engineer. He founded Parsons Brinckerhoff, one of the largest American civil engineering firms.\n Parsons was the son of William Barclay Parsons (1828\u20131887)[1] and Eliza Glass Livingston Parsons (1831\u20131922).[2]  His siblings included Schuyler (1852\u20131917), Harry (1862\u20131935), and George (1863\u20131939).[3][4] His maternal grandparents were Ann Eliza (n\u00e9e Hosie) Livingston (1805\u20131838) and Schuyler Livingston (1804\u20131861), a descendant of Walter Livingston[5] who ran a line of clipper ships from the New York harbor named Barclay & Livingston.[2]  His paternal grandparents were William Burrington Parsons (1794\u20131869) and Anne Barclay Parsons (1788\u20131869).[6]  He was the great-grandson of Henry Barclay, second Rector of Trinity Church in Manhattan.[5]\n In 1871, he went to school in Torquay, England, and studied under private tutors for four years while traveling in France, Germany, and Italy.[7]  He received a bachelor's degree from Columbia College of Columbia University in 1879, and a second from the Columbia University School of Mines in 1882.  He served as class president and president of the Philolexian Society, and he co-founded the Columbia Daily Spectator in 1877.[8] He later served as chairman of the university's board of trustees.[9]\n Parsons married Anna Dewitt Reed (1858\u20131958) on May 20, 1884. (She was the daughter of Rev. Sylvanus Reed (1821\u20131870) and Caroline Gallup Reed (1821\u20131914).[5] Her brother Sylvanus was the aerospace engineer who developed the modern metal aircraft propeller.)[10] Their children were Sylvia (1885\u20131962), who married Rudolph Weld (1883\u20131941)[11] in 1908,[12] and William (1888\u20131973),[13] who married Rose Peabody (1891\u20131985), daughter of Endicott Peabody (1857\u20131944).[14]\n Parsons died on May 9, 1932, in New York City.[9]\n Parsons worked for the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad from 1882 through 1885. He wrote Turnouts; Exact Formulae for Their Determination (1884) and Track, A Complete Manual of Maintenance of Way (1886) which both addressed railroad problems, and this interest in rail transportation continued throughout his life.[15]\n Parsons designed the Cape Cod Canal as Chief Engineer.  He was also Chief Engineer of the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners[16] and was responsible for the construction of the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT) subway line.[17][18] He left New York in October 1886 to serve as Chief Engineer for the Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railroad, although he retained his affiliation with the District Railway Company. In 1887, he became the Chief Engineer and General Manager of the Denver Railroad and Land and Coal Company. He returned to New York in 1891 upon the completion of these railway projects and a number of water-work ventures in Mississippi.[19]\n Parsons was appointed to the Isthmian Canal Commission in 1904 by President Theodore Roosevelt.[9] He was also appointed to the Advisory Board which provided technical advice to the Royal Commission on London Traffic in 1904, along with Sir Benjamin Baker and Sir John Wolfe-Barry, both British civil engineers.[20] In early 1905, he traveled to Panama as a member of the committee of engineers which favored a sea-level canal.\n Parsons was the Colonel of the 11th Engineers of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in France during World War I.[21] He was with a team of engineers in Cambrai that was suddenly attacked by Germans while making railroad repairs, and the engineers fought back with picks and shovels. He was cited for \"specially meritorious services\" and received decorations from the United States, Great Britain, France, Belgium, and the state of New York.[22]\n ", "tags": ["1859 births", "1932 deaths", "Livingston family", "Schuyler family", "American civil engineers", "Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science alumni", "History of the New York City Subway", "Columbia College (New York) alumni", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from December 2020", "Marriage template deprecations", "Biography with signature", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American civil engineer\n\n\nWilliam Barclay ParsonsBorn(1859-04-15)April 15, 1859Manhattan, New York City, New York, U.S.DiedMay 9, 1932(1932-05-09) (aged\u00a073)New York City, New York, U.S.NationalityUnited StatesAlma\u00a0materColumbia UniversitySpouse(s)Anna Dewitt Reed\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01884; his death\u00a01932)\u200b\nParent(s)William Barclay ParsonsEliza Glass LivingstonEngineering careerDisciplineCivil engineerPractice nameParsons BrinckerhoffProjectsFirst subway in New York City, Cape Cod Canal\nSignature\nWilliam Barclay Parsons (April 15, 1859 \u2013 May 9, 1932) was an American civil engineer.
