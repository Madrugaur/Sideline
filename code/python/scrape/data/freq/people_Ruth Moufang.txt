{"name": "Ruth Moufang", "content": "Ruth Moufang (January 10, 1905 \u2013 November 26, 1977) was a German mathematician.\n Born to a German chemist Dr. Eduard Moufang and Else Fecht Moufang, she studied mathematics at the University of Frankfurt. In 1931 she received her Ph.D. on projective geometry under the direction of Max Dehn, and in 1932 spent a fellowship year in Rome. After her year in Rome, she returned to Germany to lecture at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg and the University of Frankfurt.\n Denied permission to teach by the minister of education of Nazi Germany, she worked in private industry until 1946, when she became the first woman professor at the University of Frankfurt.\n Moufang's research in projective geometry built upon the work of David Hilbert. She was responsible for ground-breaking work on non-associative algebraic structures, including the Moufang loops named after her.\n In 1933, Moufang  showed Desargues's theorem does not hold in the  Cayley plane. The Cayley plane uses octonion coordinates which do not satisfy the associative law. Such connections between geometry and algebra had been previously noted by  Karl von Staudt and David Hilbert. Ruth Moufang thus initiated a new branch of geometry called Moufang planes.\n ", "tags": ["1905 births", "1977 deaths", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Algebraists", "Goethe University Frankfurt alumni", "University of K\u00f6nigsberg faculty", "Goethe University Frankfurt faculty", "People from Darmstadt", "German women academics", "20th-century women mathematicians", "German women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\nRuth MoufangBorn(1905-01-10)January 10, 1905Darmstadt, GermanyDiedNovember 26, 1977(1977-11-26) (aged\u00a072)Frankfurt am Main, GermanyNationality\u00a0GermanAlma\u00a0materGoethe University FrankfurtKnown\u00a0forMoufang planeMoufang polygonMoufang\u2013Lie algebraMoufang loopScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsGoethe University FrankfurtDoctoral advisorMax Dehn\n\nRuth Moufang (January 10, 1905 \u2013 November 26, 1977) was a German mathematician.\n\nEducation and career[edit]\nBorn to a German chemist Dr. Eduard Moufang and Else Fecht Moufang, she studied mathematics at the University of Frankfurt.
