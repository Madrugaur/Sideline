He is said to have been recognized and perhaps protected by a fascist guard, who, as a mathematics student, had admired Tur\u00e1n's work.[5]\n Tur\u00e1n became associate professor at the University of Budapest in 1945 and full professor in 1949.[1]:272 Tur\u00e1n married twice. He married Edit (Klein) K\u00f3bor in 1939; they had one son, R\u00f3bert. His second marriage was to Vera S\u00f3s, a mathematician, in 1952; they had two children, Gy\u00f6rgy and Tam\u00e1s.[6]:20\n Tur\u00e1n died in Budapest on 26 September 1976[1]:271 of leukemia, aged 66.[7]:8\n Tur\u00e1n worked primarily in number theory,[7]:4 but also did much work in analysis and graph theory.[citation needed]\n In 1934, Tur\u00e1n used the Tur\u00e1n sieve to give a new and very simple proof of a 1917 result of G.
