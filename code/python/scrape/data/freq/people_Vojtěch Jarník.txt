{"name": "Vojt\u011bch Jarn\u00edk", "content": "\n Vojt\u011bch Jarn\u00edk (Czech pronunciation: [\u02c8vojc\u025bx \u02c8jar\u0272i\u02d0k]; 1897\u20131970) was a Czech mathematician who worked for many years as a professor and administrator at Charles University, and helped found the  Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. He is the namesake of Jarn\u00edk's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.\n Jarn\u00edk worked in number theory, mathematical analysis, and graph algorithms. He has been called \"probably the first Czechoslovak mathematician whose scientific works received wide and lasting international response\".[1] As well as developing Jarn\u00edk's algorithm, he found tight bounds on the number of lattice points on convex curves, studied the relationship between the Hausdorff dimension of sets of real numbers and how well they can be approximated by rational numbers, and investigated the properties of nowhere-differentiable functions.\n Jarn\u00edk was born December 22, 1897. He was the son of Jan Urban Jarn\u00edk\u00a0[cs], a professor of Romance language philology at Charles University,[2] and his older brother, Hertv\u00edk Jarn\u00edk, also became a professor of linguistics.[3] Despite this background, Jarn\u00edk learned no Latin at his gymnasium (the C.K. \u010desk\u00e9 vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed re\u00e1ln\u00e9 gymnasium, Je\u010dn\u00e1, Prague), so when he entered Charles University in 1915 he had to do so as an extraordinary student until he could pass a Latin examination three semesters later.[3]\n He studied mathematics and physics at Charles University from 1915 to 1919, with Karel Petr as a mentor. After completing his studies, he became an assistant to Jan Vojt\u011bch at the  Brno University of Technology, where he also met Mathias Lerch.[3] In 1921 he completed a doctoral degree (RNDr.) at Charles University with a dissertation on Bessel functions supervised by Petr,[3] then returned to Charles University as Petr's assistant.[3][1][4]\n While keeping his position at Charles University, he studied with Edmund Landau at the University of G\u00f6ttingen from 1923 to 1925 and again from 1927 to 1929.[5] On his first return to Charles University he defended his habilitation,[1] and on his return from the second visit, he was given a chair in mathematics as an extraordinary professor.[1][4] He was promoted to full professor in 1935 and later served as Dean of Sciences (1947\u20131948) and Vice-Rector (1950\u20131953).[1]\nHe retired in 1968.[1][4]\n Jarn\u00edk supervised the dissertations of 16 doctoral students.\nNotable among these are Miroslav Kat\u011btov, a chess master who became rector of Charles University, Jaroslav Kurzweil, known for the Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral,\nand Slovak mathematician Tibor \u0160al\u00e1t.[3][6]\n He died September 22, 1970.[1]\n Although Jarn\u00edk's 1921 dissertation,[1] like some of his later publications, was in mathematical analysis, his main area of work was in number theory. He studied the Gauss circle problem and proved a number of results on Diophantine approximation, lattice point problems, and the geometry of numbers.[4] He also made pioneering, but long-neglected, contributions to combinatorial optimization.[7]\n The Gauss circle problem asks for the number of points of the integer lattice enclosed by a given circle.\nOne of Jarn\u00edk's theorems (1926), related to this problem, is that any convex curve with length L passes through\nat most\n points of the integer lattice. The \n\n\n\nO\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O}\n\n in this formula is an instance of Big O notation. Neither the exponent of L nor the leading constant of this bound can be improved, as there exist convex curves with this many grid points.[8][9]\n Another theorem of Jarn\u00edk in this area shows that, for any closed convex curve in the plane with a well-defined length, the absolute difference between the area it encloses and the number of integer points it encloses is at most its length.[10]\n Jarn\u00edk also published several results in Diophantine approximation, the study of the approximation of real numbers by rational numbers.\nHe proved (1928\u20131929) that the badly approximable real numbers (the ones with bounded terms in their continued fractions) have Hausdorff dimension one. This is the same dimension as the set of all real numbers, intuitively suggesting that the set of badly approximable numbers is large. He also considered the numbers x\nfor which there exist infinitely many good rational approximations p/q, with\n for a given exponent k > 2, and proved (1929) that these have the smaller Hausdorff dimension 2/k. The second of these results was later rediscovered by Besicovitch.[11] Besicovitch used different methods than Jarn\u00edk to prove it, and the result has come to be known as the Jarn\u00edk\u2013Besicovitch theorem.[12]\n Jarn\u00edk's work in real analysis was sparked by finding, in the unpublished works of Bernard Bolzano, a definition of a continuous function that was nowhere differentiable. Bolzano's 1830 discovery predated the 1872 publication of the Weierstrass function, previously considered to be the first example of such a function. Based on his study of Bolzano's function, Jarn\u00edk was led to a more general theorem: If a real-valued function of a closed interval does not have bounded variation in any subinterval, then there is a dense subset of its domain on which at least one of its Dini derivatives is infinite. This applies in particular to the nowhere-differentiable functions, as they must have unbounded variation in all intervals. Later, after learning of a result by Stefan Banach and Stefan Mazurkiewicz that generic functions (that is, the members of a residual set of functions) are nowhere differentiable, Jarn\u00edk proved that at almost all points, all four Dini derivatives of such a function are infinite. Much of his later work in this area concerned extensions of these results to approximate derivatives.[13]\n In computer science and combinatorial optimization, Jarn\u00edk is known for an algorithm for constructing minimum spanning trees that he published in 1930, in response to the publication of Bor\u016fvka's algorithm by another Czech mathematician, Otakar Bor\u016fvka.[14] Jarn\u00edk's algorithm builds a tree from a single starting vertex of a given weighted graph by repeatedly adding the cheapest connection to any other vertex, until all vertices have been connected.\nThe same algorithm was later rediscovered in the late 1950s by Robert C. Prim and Edsger W. Dijkstra. It is also known as Prim's algorithm or the Prim\u2013Dijkstra algorithm.[15]\n He also published a second, related, paper with Milo\u0161 K\u00f6ssler\u00a0[cs] (1934) on the Euclidean Steiner tree problem. In this problem, one must again form a tree connecting a given set of points, with edge costs given by the Euclidean distance. However, additional points that are not part of the input may be added to make the overall tree shorter. This paper is the first serious treatment of the general Steiner tree problem (although it appears earlier in a letter by  Gauss), and it already contains \"virtually all general properties of Steiner trees\" later attributed to other researchers.[7]\n Jarn\u00edk was a member of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts, from 1934 as an extraordinary member and from 1946 as a regular member.[1] In 1952 he became one of the founding members of  Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.[1][4] He was also awarded the Czechoslovak State Prize in 1952.[1]\n The Vojt\u011bch Jarn\u00edk International Mathematical Competition, held each year since 1991 in Ostrava, is named in his honor,[16] as is Jarn\u00edkova Street in the Chodov district of Prague.
