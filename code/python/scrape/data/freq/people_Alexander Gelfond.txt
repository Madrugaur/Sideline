Gelfond proved a special case of the theorem in 1929, when he was a postgraduate student and fully proved it in 1934. The same theorem was independently proven by Theodor Schneider, and so the theorem is often known as the Gelfond\u2013Schneider theorem.

After his works an infinite number of transcendentals could be easily obtained. Some of them are named in Gelfond's honor:\n\n2\u221a2 is known as the Gelfond\u2013Schneider constant\ne\u03c0 is known as Gelfond's constant.\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Yandell, Ben (2001).
