{"name": "Heinrich Hertz", "content": "\n Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (/h\u025c\u02d0rts/ HURTS; German: [\u02c8ha\u026an\u0281\u026a\u00e7 \u02c8h\u025b\u0281ts];[1][2] 22 February 1857\u00a0\u2013 1 January 1894) was a German physicist who first conclusively proved the existence of the electromagnetic waves predicted by James Clerk Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. The unit of frequency, cycle per second, was named the \"hertz\" in his honor.[3]\n Heinrich Rudolf Hertz was born in 1857 in Hamburg, then a sovereign state of the German Confederation, into a prosperous and cultured Hanseatic family. His father was Gustav Ferdinand Hertz.[4] His mother was Anna Elisabeth Pfefferkorn.\n While studying at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums in Hamburg, Hertz showed an aptitude for sciences as well as languages, learning Arabic and Sanskrit. He studied sciences and engineering in the German cities of Dresden, Munich and Berlin, where he studied under Gustav R. Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz. In 1880, Hertz obtained his PhD from the University of Berlin, and for the next three years remained for post-doctoral study under Helmholtz, serving as his assistant. In 1883, Hertz took a post as a lecturer in theoretical physics at the University of Kiel. In 1885, Hertz became a full professor at the University of Karlsruhe.\n In 1886, Hertz married Elisabeth Doll, the daughter of Max Doll, a lecturer in geometry at Karlsruhe. They had two daughters: Johanna, born on 20 October 1887 and Mathilde, born on 14 January 1891, who went on to become a notable biologist. During this time Hertz conducted his landmark research into electromagnetic waves.\n Hertz took a position of Professor of Physics and Director of the Physics Institute in Bonn on 3 April 1889, a position he held until his death. During this time he worked on theoretical mechanics with his work published in the book Die Prinzipien der Mechanik in neuem Zusammenhange dargestellt (The Principles of Mechanics Presented in a New Form), published posthumously in 1894.\n In 1892, Hertz was diagnosed with an infection (after a bout of severe migraines) and underwent operations to treat the illness. He died after complications in surgery in attempts to fix his condition that was causing these migraines, which some consider to have been a malignant bone condition.[5] He died at the age of 36 in Bonn, Germany in 1894, and was buried in the Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg.[6][7][8]\n Hertz's wife, Elisabeth Hertz (n\u00e9e Doll; 1864\u20131941), did not remarry. Hertz left two daughters, Johanna (1887\u20131967) and Mathilde (1891\u20131975). Hertz's daughters never married and he has no descendants.[9]\n In 1864 Scottish mathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell proposed a comprehensive theory of electromagnetism, now called Maxwell's equations.  Maxwell's theory predicted that coupled electric and magnetic fields could travel through space as an \"electromagnetic wave\".  Maxwell proposed that light consisted of electromagnetic waves of short wavelength, but no one had been able to prove this, or generate or detect electromagnetic waves of other wavelengths.\n During Hertz's studies in 1879 Helmholtz suggested that Hertz's doctoral dissertation be on testing Maxwell's theory. Helmholtz had also proposed the \"Berlin Prize\" problem that year at the Prussian Academy of Sciences for anyone who could experimentally prove an electromagnetic effect in the polarization and depolarization of insulators, something predicted by Maxwell's theory.[11][12] Helmholtz was sure Hertz was the most likely candidate to win it.[12] Not seeing any way to build an apparatus to experimentally test this, Hertz thought it was too difficult, and worked on electromagnetic induction instead. Hertz did produce an analysis of Maxwell's equations during his time at Kiel, showing they did have more validity than the then prevalent \"action at a distance\" theories.[13]\n After Hertz received his professorship at Karlsruhe he was experimenting with a pair of Riess spirals in the autumn of 1886 when he noticed that discharging a Leyden jar into one of these coils produced a spark in the other coil. With an idea on how to build an apparatus, Hertz now had a way to proceed with the \"Berlin Prize\" problem of 1879 on proving Maxwell's theory (although the actual prize had expired uncollected in 1882).[14][15] He used a Ruhmkorff coil-driven spark gap and one-meter wire pair as a radiator. Capacity spheres were present at the ends for circuit resonance adjustments. His receiver was a loop antenna with a micrometer spark gap between the elements. This experiment produced and received what are now called radio waves in the very high frequency range.\n Between 1886 and 1889 Hertz conducted a series of experiments that would prove the effects he was observing were results of Maxwell's predicted electromagnetic waves. Starting in November 1887 with his paper \"On Electromagnetic Effects Produced by Electrical Disturbances in Insulators\", Hertz sent a series of papers to Helmholtz at the Berlin Academy, including papers in 1888 that showed transverse free space electromagnetic waves traveling at a finite speed over a distance.[15][16] In the apparatus Hertz used, the electric and magnetic fields radiated away from the wires as transverse waves. Hertz had positioned the oscillator about 12 meters from a zinc reflecting plate to produce standing waves. Each wave was about 4 meters long.[citation needed] Using the ring detector, he recorded how the wave's magnitude and component direction varied. Hertz measured Maxwell's waves and demonstrated that the velocity of these waves was equal to the velocity of light. The electric field intensity, polarization and reflection of the waves were also measured by Hertz. These experiments established that light and these waves were both a form of electromagnetic radiation obeying the Maxwell equations.\n Hertz did not realize the practical importance of his radio wave experiments. He stated that,[18][19][20]\n Asked about the applications of his discoveries, Hertz replied,[18][21]\n Hertz's proof of the existence of airborne electromagnetic waves led to an explosion of experimentation with this new form of electromagnetic radiation, which was called \"Hertzian waves\" until around 1910 when the term \"radio waves\" became current.  Within 10 years researchers such as Oliver Lodge, Ferdinand Braun, and Guglielmo Marconi employed radio waves in the first wireless telegraphy radio communication systems, leading to radio broadcasting, and later television. In 1909, Braun and Marconi received the Nobel Prize in physics for their \"contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy\".[22] Today radio is an essential technology in global telecommunication networks, and the transmission medium underlying modern wireless devices.\"Heinrich Hertz\". Retrieved 3 February 2020.[23]\n In 1892, Hertz began experimenting and demonstrated that cathode rays could penetrate very thin metal foil (such as aluminium). Philipp Lenard, a student of Heinrich Hertz, further researched this \"ray effect\". He developed a version of the cathode tube and studied the penetration by X-rays of various materials. Philipp Lenard, though, did not realize that he was producing X-rays. Hermann von Helmholtz formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before R\u00f6ntgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light (Wiedmann's Annalen, Vol. XLVIII). However, he did not work with actual X-rays.\n Hertz helped establish the photoelectric effect (which was later explained by Albert Einstein) when he noticed that a charged object loses its charge more readily when illuminated by ultraviolet radiation (UV). In 1887, he made observations of the photoelectric effect and of the production and reception of electromagnetic (EM) waves, published in the journal Annalen der Physik. His receiver consisted of a coil with a spark gap, whereby a spark would be seen upon detection of EM waves. He placed the apparatus in a darkened box to see the spark better. He observed that the maximum spark length was reduced when in the box. A glass panel placed between the source of EM waves and the receiver absorbed UV that assisted the electrons in jumping across the gap. When removed, the spark length would increase. He observed no decrease in spark length when he substituted quartz for glass, as quartz does not absorb UV radiation. Hertz concluded his months of investigation and reported the results obtained. He did not further pursue investigation of this effect, nor did he make any attempt at explaining how the observed phenomenon was brought about.\n In 1886\u20131889, Hertz published two articles on what was to become known as the field of contact mechanics, which proved to be an important basis for later theories in the field.   Joseph Valentin Boussinesq published some critically important observations on Hertz's work, nevertheless establishing this work on contact mechanics to be of immense importance. His work basically summarises how two axi-symmetric objects placed in contact will behave under loading, he obtained results based upon the classical theory of elasticity and continuum mechanics. The most significant flaw of his theory was the neglect of any nature of adhesion between the two solids, which proves to be important as the materials composing the solids start to assume high elasticity. It was natural to neglect adhesion at the time, however, as there were no experimental methods of testing for it.\n To develop his theory Hertz used his observation of elliptical Newton's rings formed upon placing a glass sphere upon a lens as the basis of assuming that the pressure exerted by the sphere follows an elliptical distribution. He used the formation of Newton's rings again while validating his theory with experiments in calculating the displacement which the sphere has into the lens. Kenneth L. Johnson, K. Kendall and A. D. Roberts (JKR) used this theory as a basis while calculating the theoretical displacement or indentation depth in the presence of adhesion in 1971.[24] Hertz's theory is recovered from their formulation if the adhesion of the materials is assumed to be zero. Similar to this theory, however using different assumptions, B. V. Derjaguin, V. M. Muller and Y. P. Toporov published another theory in 1975, which came to be known as the DMT theory in the research community, which also recovered Hertz's formulations under the assumption of zero adhesion. This DMT theory proved to be premature and needed several revisions before it came to be accepted as another material contact theory in addition to the JKR theory. Both the DMT and the JKR theories form the basis of contact mechanics upon which all transition contact models are based and used in material parameter prediction in nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy. These models are central to the field of tribology and he was named as one of the 23 \"Men of Tribology\" by Duncan Dowson.[25] Hertz's research from his days as a lecturer, which preceded his great work on electromagnetism, which he himself considered with his characteristic soberness to be trivial, has facilitated the age of nanotechnology.\n Hertz also described the \"Hertzian cone\", a type of fracture mode in brittle solids caused by the transmission of stress waves.\n Hertz always had a deep interest in meteorology, probably derived from his contacts with Wilhelm von Bezold (who was his professor in a laboratory course at the Munich Polytechnic in the summer of 1878).  As an assistant to Helmholtz in Berlin, he contributed a few minor articles in the field, including research on the evaporation of liquids,[26] a new kind of hygrometer, and a graphical means of determining the properties of moist air when subjected to adiabatic changes.[27]\n Heinrich Hertz was a Lutheran throughout his life and would not have considered himself Jewish, as his father's family had all converted to Lutheranism[28] when his father was still in his childhood (aged seven) in 1834.[29]\n Nevertheless, when the Nazi regime gained power decades after Hertz's death, its officials removed his portrait from its prominent position of honor in Hamburg's City Hall (Rathaus) because of his partly Jewish ancestry. (The painting has since been returned to public display.[30])\n Hertz's widow and daughters left Germany in the 1930s and settled in England.\n Heinrich Hertz's nephew Gustav Ludwig Hertz was a Nobel Prize winner, and Gustav's son Carl Helmut Hertz invented medical ultrasonography. His daughter Mathilde Carmen Hertz was a well-known biologist and comparative psychologist. Hertz's grandnephew Hermann Gerhard Hertz, professor at the University of Karlsruhe, was a pioneer of NMR-spectroscopy and in 1995 published Hertz's laboratory notes.[31]\n The SI unit hertz (Hz) was established in his honor by the International Electrotechnical Commission in 1930 for frequency, an expression of the number of times that a repeated event occurs per second. It was adopted by the CGPM (Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures) in 1960, officially replacing the previous name, \"cycles per second\" (cps).\n In 1928 the Heinrich-Hertz Institute for Oscillation Research was founded in Berlin. Today known as the Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, HHI.\n In 1969, in East Germany, a Heinrich Hertz memorial medal[32] was cast. The IEEE Heinrich Hertz Medal, established in 1987, is \"for outstanding achievements in Hertzian waves [...] presented annually to an individual for achievements which are theoretical or experimental in nature\".\n In 1980, in Italy a High School called \"Istituto Tecnico Industriale Statale Heinrich Hertz\" was founded in the neighborhood of Cinecitt\u00e0 Est, in Rome.\n A crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, just behind the eastern limb, is named in his honor. The Hertz market for radio electronics products in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, is named after him. The Heinrich-Hertz-Turm radio telecommunication tower in Hamburg is named after the city's famous son.\n Hertz is honored by Japan with a membership in the Order of the Sacred Treasure, which has multiple layers of honor for prominent people, including scientists.[33]\n Heinrich Hertz has been honored by a number of countries around the world in their postage issues, and in post-World War II times has appeared on various German stamp issues as well.\n On his birthday in 2012, Google honored Hertz with a Google doodle, inspired by his life's work, on its home page.[34][35]\n \n \n  Media related to Heinrich Rudolf Hertz at Wikimedia Commons\n Quotations related to Heinrich Hertz at Wikiquote\n ", "tags": ["Heinrich Hertz", "1857 births", "1894 deaths", "German inventors", "German people of Jewish descent", "German Lutherans", "German philosophers", "German physicists", "Humboldt University of Berlin alumni", "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology faculty", "Scientists from Hamburg", "Radio pioneers", "Technical University of Munich alumni", "University of Bonn faculty", "University of Kiel faculty", "German male writers", "People educated at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums", "Burials at the Ohlsdorf Cemetery", "19th-century German scientists", "19th-century physicists", "People from Hamburg", "Tribologists", "Recipients of the Matteucci Medal", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 maint: bot: original URL status unknown", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from February 2021", "Biography with signature", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2020", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "German physicist, namesake of the SI unit of frequency\n\n\nHeinrich HertzBornHeinrich Rudolf Hertz(1857-02-22)22 February 1857Hamburg, German ConfederationDied1 January 1894(1894-01-01) (aged\u00a036)Bonn, German EmpireAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Munich University of BerlinKnown\u00a0forContact mechanicsElectromagnetic radiationEmagramParabolic antennaPhotoelectric effectHertzian coneHertzian dipole antennaHertz vectorHertz-Knudsen equationHertz's principle of least curvatureAwardsMatteucci Medal (1888)Rumford Medal (1890)Scientific careerFieldsElectromagnetism  Electrical engineering  Contact mechanicsInstitutionsUniversity of KielUniversity of KarlsruheUniversity of BonnDoctoral advisorHermann von HelmholtzDoctoral studentsVilhelm Bjerknes\nSignature\nHeinrich Rudolf Hertz (/h\u025c\u02d0rts/ HURTS; German: [\u02c8ha\u026an\u0281\u026a\u00e7 \u02c8h\u025b\u0281ts];[1][2] 22 February 1857\u00a0\u2013 1 January 1894) was a German physicist who first conclusively proved the existence of the electromagnetic waves predicted by James Clerk Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism.

Hertz left two daughters, Johanna (1887\u20131967) and Mathilde (1891\u20131975). Hertz's daughters never married and he has no descendants.[9]\n\n\nScientific work[edit]\nElectromagnetic waves[edit]\nHertz's 1887 apparatus for generating and detecting radio waves: a spark-gap transmitter (left) consisting of a dipole antenna with a spark gap (S) powered by high voltage pulses from a Ruhmkorff coil (T), and a receiver (right) consisting of a loop antenna and spark gap.One of Hertz's radio wave receivers: a loop antenna with an adjustable spark micrometer (bottom).[10]\nIn 1864 Scottish mathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell proposed a comprehensive theory of electromagnetism, now called Maxwell's equations.  Maxwell's theory predicted that coupled electric and magnetic fields could travel through space as an \"electromagnetic wave\".

Capacity spheres were present at the ends for circuit resonance adjustments. His receiver was a loop antenna with a micrometer spark gap between the elements. This experiment produced and received what are now called radio waves in the very high frequency range.\n\n\n Hertz's first radio transmitter: a capacitance loaded dipole resonator consisting of a pair of one meter copper wires with a 7.5\u00a0mm spark gap between them, ending in 30 cm zinc spheres.[10] When an induction coil applied a high voltage between the two sides, sparks across the spark gap created standing waves of radio frequency current in the wires, which radiated radio waves. The frequency of the waves was roughly 50 MHz, about that used in modern television transmitters.\nBetween 1886 and 1889 Hertz conducted a series of experiments that would prove the effects he was observing were results of Maxwell's predicted electromagnetic waves. Starting in November 1887 with his paper \"On Electromagnetic Effects Produced by Electrical Disturbances in Insulators\", Hertz sent a series of papers to Helmholtz at the Berlin Academy, including papers in 1888 that showed transverse free space electromagnetic waves traveling at a finite speed over a distance.[15][16] In the apparatus Hertz used, the electric and magnetic fields radiated away from the wires as transverse waves.

The electric field intensity, polarization and reflection of the waves were also measured by Hertz. These experiments established that light and these waves were both a form of electromagnetic radiation obeying the Maxwell equations.\n\nHertz's directional spark transmitter (center), a half-wave dipole antenna made of two 13 cm brass rods with spark gap at center (closeup left) powered by a Ruhmkorff coil, on focal line of a 1.2 m x 2 m cylindrical sheet metal parabolic reflector.[17] It radiated a beam of 66 cm waves with frequency of about 450\u00a0MHz.  Receiver (right) is similar parabolic dipole antenna with micrometer spark gap.Hertz's demonstration of polarization of radio waves: the receiver does not respond when antennas are perpendicular as shown, but as receiver is rotated the received signal grows stronger (as shown by length of sparks) until it reaches a maximum when dipoles are parallel.[17]Another demonstration of polarization: waves pass through polarizing filter to the receiver only when the wires are perpendicular to dipoles (A), not when parallel (B).[17]Demonstration of refraction: radio waves bend when passing through a prism made of pitch, similarly to light waves when passing through a glass prism.[17]Hertz' plot of standing waves created when radio waves are reflected from a sheet of metal\nHertz did not realize the practical importance of his radio wave experiments. He stated that,[18][19][20]\n\n\"It's of no use whatsoever[...] this is just an experiment that proves Maestro Maxwell was right\u2014we just have these mysterious electromagnetic waves that we cannot see with the naked eye. But they are there.\"\nAsked about the applications of his discoveries, Hertz replied,[18][21]\n\n\"Nothing, I guess.\"\nHertz's proof of the existence of airborne electromagnetic waves led to an explosion of experimentation with this new form of electromagnetic radiation, which was called \"Hertzian waves\" until around 1910 when the term \"radio waves\" became current.

The Heinrich-Hertz-Turm radio telecommunication tower in Hamburg is named after the city's famous son.\nHertz is honored by Japan with a membership in the Order of the Sacred Treasure, which has multiple layers of honor for prominent people, including scientists.[33]\nHeinrich Hertz has been honored by a number of countries around the world in their postage issues, and in post-World War II times has appeared on various German stamp issues as well.\nOn his birthday in 2012, Google honored Hertz with a Google doodle, inspired by his life's work, on its home page.[34][35]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n\nLists and histories\nFraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute\nHistory of radio\nInvention of radio\nList of people on stamps of Germany\nList of physicists\nOutline of physics\nTimeline of mechanics and physics\nElectromagnetism timeline\nWireless telegraphy\n\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic radiation\nMicrowave\nOther\nList of German inventors and discoverers\n\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Krech, Eva-Maria; Stock, Eberhard; Hirschfeld, Ursula; Anders, Lutz Christian (2009).
