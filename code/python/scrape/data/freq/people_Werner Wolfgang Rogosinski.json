{"name": "Werner Wolfgang Rogosinski", "content": "\n Werner Wolfgang Rogosinski FRS[1] (24 September 1894 \u2013 23 July 1964) was a German (later British) mathematician.[3][4]\n Rogosinski was born in Breslau, into a Jewish family.[5] His father, Hermann Rogosinski was Counsel in Wroclaw. Rogosinski studied at Mary Magdalen School from 1900 until 1913. He attended the University of Breslau, University of Freiburg and University of G\u00f6ttingen, with Edmund Landau.  His studies were interrupted by World War I, in which Rogosinski served as a medic.\n Rogosinski focused his studies on pure mathematics, physics and philosophy. His interest was analytical problems, especially in series. His dissertation, \"New Application of Pfeiffer's method for Dirichlet's divisor problem\", caused a stir in 1922.\n In 1923, he went to Koenigsberg, first as a lecturer, becoming an associate professor in 1928.\nHe worked for five years with Richard Brauer, G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151 and Kurt Reidemeister.\nRogosinski and Szeg\u0151 families became friends.\nHis first book Fouriersche Reihen was published in 1930. It provided a student's introduction to Fourier series.[6]\nThe original was translated into English in 1950 and is still used.\n Rogosinski married in 1928 in K\u00f6nigsberg. In 1932, his son Peter was born. After the Nazi takeover, his fortunes changed. In 1936, his teaching credentials were withdrawn. He was allowed only in some Jewish schools in Berlin. The Cambridge professors G. H. Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood invited him to come to the United Kingdom.\nHe moved with his wife and child to Cambridge in 1937, with support from the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning.\n He published five papers with Hardy from 1943 to 1949, under the title Notes on Fourier series. In 1944 Rogisinski and Hardy published their book Fourier Series,[7] which might be said to be a rewrite, using Lebesgue integral methods, of Rogosinski's 1930 book. \nHe was a teacher in Aberdeen in 1941.\nIn 1945, he became a lecturer at Newcastle University (prior to 1963, King's College, University of Durham). In 1947 he was appointed professor and in 1948 Head of Department.\n In 1959, Rogosinski resigned his position at Newcastle.\nSvend Bundgaard brought him into the Mathematical Institute at Aarhus.\nIn 1954, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society.[1]\nIn 1962, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences.\nHis intention was to go to the new University of Sussex. He died after a long illness, aged 69, in Aarhus.\n ", "tags": ["1894 births", "1964 deaths", "German Jews", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Scientists from Wroc\u0142aw", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "German military personnel of World War I", "People from the Province of Silesia", "20th-century British mathematicians", "Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United Kingdom", "CS1 maint: uses authors parameter", "EngvarB from August 2017", "Use dmy dates from August 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nWerner W.
