He was member of the parliament and former Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey responsible for the Economy. He first served as the Minister of State in charge of economic affairs in the 58th cabinet from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party). He retained this position throughout the 58th and 59th Governments of the Republic of Turkey. On 29 August 2007 he was appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the 60th Government of the Republic of Turkey.[1] During 2009\u20132015 he served as the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs of Turkey. He is married with three children.[2] In 2019, Babacan left the AKP, citing \"deep differences\" over the party's direction as a reason and founded the Democracy and Progress Party (DEVA) in 2020.\n Ali Babacan graduated from TED Ankara College ranking first among the class of 1985.[3] He attended the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara and in 1989 was awarded a BSc in Industrial Engineering with the highest marks (4.00 point out of 4.00).[3]\n Babacan went to the U.S. on a Fulbright Scholarship to do postgraduate studies and in 1992 received an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, with majors in marketing, organizational behavior and international business.[3]\n Babacan worked then for two years as an associate at QRM, Inc. in Chicago, Illinois, a company doing financial consulting to the top executives of major banks in the United States.[3] He returned to Turkey in 1994 and, served as chief advisor to the mayor of Ankara the same year. He was the chairman of his family owned textile company between 1994 and 2002.[4]\n He entered politics in 2001 as a co-founder and a Board member of the Justice and Development Party [5] and was elected to parliament as deputy for Ankara on 3 November 2002. He was appointed Minister of Economy on 18 November 2002 and became the youngest member of the cabinet, then at the age of 35.[6]\n Ali Babacan had the duty to steer a painful economic reform program, which was backed by multibillion-dollar IMF loans; with its help Turkish economy achieved a remarkable recovery after two severe crises. He stayed always away from the rough-and-tumble of the Turkish political arena and focused solely on the economic reform, acting rather as a technocrat without indulging into populism.\n On 24 May 2005 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan announced his appointment as chief negotiator in Turkey's accession talks with the European Union,[7] which started on 3 October 2005.[8] As government minister Babacan attended several international meetings including the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and the Bilderberg Group.\n In 2019, Babacan left the ruling AKP, citing \"deep differences\" over the party's direction as a reason.[9]\n Babacan confirmed his intent to form this party in a late 2019 interview with journalist \u015eirin Payz\u0131n of T24, and expects his party to be a \"mainstream party\" with particular focuses on minority rights, a return to Turkey's parliamentary system, fair processes in courts and legislation, and restoring freedom of speech and expression. Babacan is quoted as saying that \"the nation will give our party its name\".[10]\n On 9 March 2020, he founded Democracy and Progress Party, abbreviated as \"DEVA\" or \"remedy\" in Turkish.[11] The DEVA Party held its first meeting of the Board of Founders on 10 March 2020,\u00a0where Ali Babacan was unanimously elected Chairman.[12]\n ", "tags": ["1967 births", "Living people", "Deputies of Ankara", "Deputy Prime Ministers of Turkey", "Kellogg School of Management alumni", "Fulbright Scholars", "Justice and Development Party (Turkey) politicians", "Democracy and Progress Party politicians", "Middle East Technical University alumni", "Ministers of Economic Affairs of Turkey", "Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Turkey", "People from Ankara", "TED Ankara College Foundation Schools alumni", "Members of the 24th Parliament of Turkey", "Members of the 23rd Parliament of Turkey", "Members of the 22nd Parliament of Turkey", "Members of the 26th Parliament of Turkey", "Ministers of State of Turkey", "Members of the 60th government of Turkey", "CS1 Turkish-language sources (tr)", "CS1 errors: generic title", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "Turkish politician\nAli BabacanBabacan 2020Leader of the Democracy and Progress PartyIncumbentAssumed office 10 March 2020Preceded byPosition establishedDeputy Prime Minister of TurkeyIn office1 May 2009\u00a0\u2013 28 August 2015Prime MinisterRecep Tayyip Erdo\u011fanAhmet Davuto\u011fluServing withB\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7Be\u015fir AtalayBekir Bozda\u011fEmrullah \u0130\u015flerYal\u00e7\u0131n Akdo\u011fanNuman Kurtulmu\u015fPreceded byNaz\u0131m EkrenSucceeded byCevdet Y\u0131lmaz41st Minister of Foreign AffairsIn office29 August 2007\u00a0\u2013 1 May 2009Prime MinisterRecep Tayyip Erdo\u011fanPreceded byAbdullah G\u00fclSucceeded byAhmet Davuto\u011fluChief Negotiator for Turkish Accession to the European UnionIn office17 January 2005\u00a0\u2013 11 January 2009Prime MinisterRecep Tayyip Erdo\u011fanPreceded byPosition establishedSucceeded byEgemen Ba\u011f\u0131\u015fMinister of State Responsible for EconomyIn office18 November 2002\u00a0\u2013 29 August 2007Prime MinisterAbdullah G\u00fclRecep Tayyip Erdo\u011fanPreceded byMasum T\u00fcrkerSucceeded byMehmet \u015eim\u015fekMember of the Grand National AssemblyIn office1 November 2015\u00a0\u2013 9 July 2018ConstituencyAnkara (I) (Nov 2015)In office19 November 2002\u00a0\u2013 7 June 2015ConstituencyAnkara (I) (2002, 2007, 2011)\nPersonal detailsBorn (1967-04-04) 4 April 1967 (age\u00a054)Ankara, TurkeyPolitical partyJustice and Development Party (2001\u20132019)Democracy and Progress Party (2020\u2013present)Spouse(s)\u00dclk\u00fc Zeynep Yurter \u200b(m.\u00a01995)\u200bChildren3Alma materMiddle East Technical UniversityNorthwestern University\nAli Babacan (Turkish pronunciation:\u00a0[a\u02c8li baba\u02c8d\u0292an]; born 4 April 1967) is a Turkish politician.
