{"name": "William Lescaze", "content": "William Edmond Lescaze (27 March 1896 \u2013 9 February 1969) was a Swiss-born American architect, city planner and industrial designer. He ranked among the pioneers of modernism in American architecture.\n William Lescaze was born in Onex, Switzerland. He studied at the Coll\u00e8ge Calvin and at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, before completing his formal education at the \u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Zurich in Zurich where Karl Moser was a teacher,[1] receiving his degree in 1919.\n He contributed to the post-war reconstruction effort of Arras,[1] and then immigrated to the US in 1920. He worked for some time at the architectural firm of Hubbell & Benes in Cleveland, Ohio, and taught French during night classes at the YMCA.[2]\n In 1923, he was offered a modeling job and moved to New York City where he set up his business. His first major work was the design of the Oak Lane Country Day School outside Philadelphia.[2]\n In 1929, Philadelphia architect George Howe invited William Lescaze to form a partnership, Howe & Lescaze. Within just a few weeks after joining forces, the duo began work on a large project for downtown Philadelphia. The resulting structure, completed in 1932, was the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (PSFS) Building, which is today generally considered the first International Modernist skyscraper, and the first International Style building of wide significance in the United States. It was also the first building with full air conditioning.[2] Lescaze is generally given credit for the design: letters from Howe to Lescaze quote the former insisting to the latter that \"the design is definitely yours.\" The structure replaced the bank's former headquarters in Philadelphia, a classicist structure near Washington Square built in 1897.\n In 1930, Howe & Lescaze submitted a design for the new building of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.[3]  The wood and metal model was donated to the MOMA in 1994. In 1935, William Lescaze established his own architecture firm, Lescaze & associates.[2]\n His 1937 Alfred Loomis house in Tuxedo Park, NY is regarded as an early experiment in double-skin facade construction.[4] In 1939 he designed a futuristic \"House for 2089\" which included a helipad on the roof.[5]\n Lescaze was also the design lead for the 1937 Williamsburg Houses in Brooklyn, a pioneering 20-building modernist housing project modeled on European examples.  He later taught industrial design at the Pratt Institute (1943\u20131945). Among his built works were the CBS West Coast studios Columbia Square on Sunset Boulevard (1938).\n William Lescaze also designed the office building at 711 Third Street, the city and municipal courts building in the Civic Center in Manhattan, and the High School of Art and Design. From 1949 to 1959, he served at the State Building Code Commission[2]\n William Lescaze died on 9 February 1969 of a heart attack at his New York home. He was a proponent of modern architecture, stating it was the only architecture that could solve the housing problem.[2]\n He was married to Mary Hughes. His son Lee Adrien Lescaze (1938\u20131996) was an editor for The Washington Post.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1896 births", "1969 deaths", "20th-century American architects", "Swiss architects", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American architect\nWilliam Edmond Lescaze (27 March 1896 \u2013 9 February 1969) was a Swiss-born American architect, city planner and industrial designer.
