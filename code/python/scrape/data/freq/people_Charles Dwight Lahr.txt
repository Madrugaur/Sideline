Lahr became an associate professor in 1981, served as associate dean of faculty for sciences and dean of graduate studies, and became full professor and dean of the faculty in 1984.[4] In 1994, he was the founder and director of \"CLIPP, a Dartmouth Summer Institute to develop computer literacy for inner city public school teachers\" and to provide them computer equipment.[4] He retired in 2014,[2] and in 2021 Dartmouth College inaugurated the C. Dwight Lahr Lecture series.[4]\n His area of specialization was functional analysis, and he published 12 papers in the field.
