He is credited with writing the first modern and high-level text on group theory, his The Theory of Groups published in 1944.\n He was born in Yartsevo, in the Dukhovshchinsky Uyezd of the Smolensk Governorate of the Russian Empire and died in Moscow. He received his doctorate from the Moscow State University in 1936 under the direction of Pavel Alexandrov. In 1937 he became a professor there, and from 1949 until his death he held the Chair of Higher Algebra at Moscow State University.  In 1938, he was the PhD thesis adviser to his fellow group theory scholar Sergei Chernikov, with whom he would develop important relationships between finite and infinite groups, discover the Kurosh-Chernikov class of groups, and publish several influential papers over the next decades.
