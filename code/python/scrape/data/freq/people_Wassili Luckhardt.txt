He studied at the Technical University of Berlin (Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin) and Dresden. Luckhardt and his brother Hans worked closely together for most of their lives. Both were members of the November Group (Novembergruppe), the Arbeitsrat f\u00fcr Kunst, the Glass Chain and, from 1926, the progressive architecture group Der Ring.

It quickly became apparent however that the new regime required a different architectural language. They were professionally disqualified and could only build three single-family houses in this time, the exterior of which was made to blend in with the preferred style of the regime.\n After World War II they tried to return to their pre-war work. After the death of his brother Hans, Wassili ran the office alone.
