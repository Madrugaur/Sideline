{"name": "Murray Gerstenhaber", "content": "Murray Gerstenhaber (born June 5, 1927) is an American mathematician and professor of mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania, best known for his contributions to theoretical physics with his discovery of Gerstenhaber algebra. He is also a lawyer and a lecturer in law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n \nGerstenhaber was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Pauline (n\u00e9e Rosenzweig; who was born in Romania; died in 1978) and Joseph Gerstenhaber (who was born in 1892 in Romania; died in 1975), and is Jewish.[citation needed] His father was trained as a jeweler, \"but being unable to find work in this line he [took] employment in a factory making airplane precision instruments\u201d.[1] As to his mother, in 2015 he noted:  \"For someone born into a minority family without means, I have been exceedingly lucky. The problems faced by talented but disadvantaged children today are preventing many who could be important contributors to the sciences, arts, and society in general, from achieving their potential. They don\u2019t all have mothers like mine, who fought to find a path to education for her child. We have to seek them out but are not doing enough to find them, bring them out of isolation, and give them the opportunities I was so fortunate to have enjoyed.\"[1] He was a child prodigy who was profiled in Leta Hollingworth's book Children Above 180 IQ (1942).[2][1] In this book, Gerstenhaber was dubbed \"Child L,\" and his prodigious abilities and personality traits were described in great detail.[1] At age 9 years 5 months, a Stanford-Binet test showed him to have a mental age of between 17 and 18 and an IQ between 195 and 198. A second revised Stanford-Binet given a year later found him to have a mental age of 19 years 11 months and an IQ of 199+.\n He attended the now-defunct Speyer School, a school for rapid learners in New York City. After graduating from Speyer School, Gerstenhaber entered the Bronx High School of Science in 1940.[3] From 1945 to 1947 he served in the infantry in the United States Army as a corporal assigned to the Office of Military Government for Germany.[4]\n Gerstenhaber finished his B.S. in mathematics at Yale University (1948).[5] At Yale, he participated in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition and was on the team representing Yale University (along with Murray Gell-Mann and Henry O. Pollak) that won the second prize in 1947; each of them received a monetary prize of $30 ($340 in current dollar terms).[6] His 1948 participation in the competition earned him a Top 10 ranking.\n He earned an M.A. and a Ph.D. (1951) in mathematics from the University of Chicago, under the instruction of Abraham Adrian Albert.[7] Gerstenhaber's dissertation was entitled \"Rings of Derivations.\"[7]\n Gerstenhaber earned a J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1973, and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1974.[citation needed]\n Gerstenhaber was an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania from 1953 to 1958, rising to associate professor (1958\u201361), and full professor (1961\u2013present) and chairman.[8][5] His research interests include: Algebraic Deformation Theory, Universal Algebra, Quantum Groups, and Statistics for Law. He is best known for his contributions to theoretical physics with his discovery of Gerstenhaber algebra.\n Among his writings have been \"Algebraic cohomology and deformation theory,\" with SD Schack, Deformation theory of algebras and structures and applications, 11\u2013264 (1988), \"On the deformation of rings and algebras,\" Annals of Mathematics, Second Series, Vol. 79, No. 1 (Jan., 1964), pp.\u00a059\u2013103, and \"The cohomology structure of an associative ring,\" Annals of Mathematics, Second Series, Vol. 78, 267\u2013288 (1963).[9][10] For these last two papers he received in 2021 the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research.[11] Gerstenhaber noted in 1990:  \u201cThe ability to hang in there has a lot to do with scientific productivity, I am convinced. And in mathematics \u2026 hanging in there is a solitary accomplishment.\u201d[1]\n Gerstenhaber was chairman of the faculty senate at the University of Pennsylvania from 1982 to 1983.[5]\n He is also a lecturer in law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, teaching a seminar on statistics for law.[12][5]\n In 2012 he became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society, and was a member of its council.[13] Gerstenhaber was the managing editor of the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society.[5] Gerstenhaber is also a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[citation needed]\n Gerstenhaber married Dr. Ruth Priscilla Zager on June 3, 1956, in the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in New York City.[14][15] They have lived in Merion Station, Pennsylvania, and Haverford, Pennsylvania, and have three children: Jeremy M. Gerstenhaber, David Ezra Gerstenhaber (now founder, president, and portfolio manager at Argonaut Management), and Rachel Rebecca Stern (now general counsel and head of strategic resources of FactSet).[16][17][18][19] His son David, a hedge fund manager and Tiger Management alumnus, is married to financier Steven Posner's daughter Kelly.[20]\n ", "tags": ["American people of Romanian-Jewish descent", "Jewish American scientists", "Jewish physicists", "Jewish American academics", "Jewish American attorneys", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Mathematical physicists", "Theoretical physicists", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Yale University alumni", "University of Chicago alumni", "University of Pennsylvania Law School alumni", "University of Pennsylvania Law School faculty", "University of Pennsylvania faculty", "1927 births", "Living people", "The Bronx High School of Science alumni", "Scientists from New York City", "Lawyers from New York City", "Mathematicians from New York (state)", "Mathematicians from Philadelphia", "People from Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania", "People from Haverford Township, Pennsylvania", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from May 2019", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nProfessorMurray GerstenhaberMurray Gerstenhaber at Oberwolfach in 2010Born (1927-06-05) June 5, 1927 (age\u00a093)Brooklyn, New York, USCitizenshipAmericanOccupationmathematician, professor of mathematics, lawyer, lecturer in lawKnown\u00a0forhis contributions to theoretical physics with his discovery of Gerstenhaber algebraSpouse(s)Ruth Priscilla ZagerChildren3Parent(s)Pauline (n\u00e9e Rosenzweig) and Joseph GerstenhaberAwardsFellow of the American Mathematical SocietyAcademic backgroundAlma mater\nYale University (B.S. in mathematics, 1948)\nUniversity of Chicago (M.A. and Ph.D. in mathematics, 1951)\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Law School (J.D., 1973)\nThesis\"Rings of Derivations\"\u00a0(1951)Doctoral advisorAbraham Adrian AlbertAcademic workInstitutionsthe University of Pennsylvania and the University of Pennsylvania Law SchoolMain interestsAlgebraic Deformation Theory, Universal Algebra, Quantum Groups, and Statistics for Law.\n\nMurray Gerstenhaber (born June 5, 1927) is an American mathematician and professor of mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania, best known for his contributions to theoretical physics with his discovery of Gerstenhaber algebra.
