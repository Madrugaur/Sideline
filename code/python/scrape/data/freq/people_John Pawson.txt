On his return to England he enrolled at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, leaving to establish his own practice in 1981.[4]\n Pawson's work focuses on ways of approaching fundamental problems of space, proportion, light and materials.[4]\n Whilst private houses have remained at the core of the work, projects have spanned a wide range of scales and building typologies, from the Sackler Crossing across the lake at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, a flagship store for Calvin Klein and major commissions for Ian Schrager, to ballet sets, yacht interiors, a new Cistercian monastery in Bohemia and a Second World War telecommunications bunker in Berlin.
