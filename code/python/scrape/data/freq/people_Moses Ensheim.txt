{"name": "Moses Ensheim", "content": "Moses Ensheim (1750\u20139 April 1839), also known as Brisac and Moses Metz, was a French-Jewish mathematician and Hebrew poet.\n Destined for the rabbinate by his parents, Ensheim left his native Metz against his father's will, and for many years led a wandering life. From 1782 to 1785 he was tutor in the family of Moses Mendelssohn in Berlin, having special charge over the education of Abraham Mendelssohn.[1] On leaving Mendelssohn's house he returned to Metz, where he struggled hard to make a living by teaching mathematics. Being a Jew, he was rejected for the position of professor of mathematics at the newly founded \u00c9cole centrale de Metz.\n Ensheim was a prominent member of the movement instituted by the Me'assefim. In 178[clarification needed], he published a volume of Hebrew riddles. In 1790, Ensheim published Shalosh \u1e24idot, a satire against billiards card card games, and two hymns: Al-ha-Va'ad ha-Gadol asher bi-medinat \u1e92arefat, addressed to the National Assembly in Versailles, and the triumphal song La-Mena\u1e93e'a\u1e25 Shir, which was sung in 1793 in the synagogue at Metz to the tune of La Marseillaise.[2]\n He was an intimate friend of Abb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire, and helped him with the preparation of his 1788 essay in defense of the Jews. His Recherches sur les calculs diff\u00e9rentiels et int\u00e9grals (1799) was highly praised by Lagrange and Laplace, with whom he was personally associated.\n His last years were passed at Bayonne as a tutor in the home of Abraham Furtado, his leisure being devoted to Talmudical studies. Before his death in 1839 he gave 12,000 francs, one-fourth of his fortune, to the Jewish elementary school of Metz.[1]\n ", "tags": ["1750 births", "1839 deaths", "Jewish French scientists", "18th-century French mathematicians", "19th-century French mathematicians", "French Jews", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia without a Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from August 2018", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Moses Ensheim (1750\u20139 April 1839), also known as Brisac and Moses Metz, was a French-Jewish mathematician and Hebrew poet.\n\nBiography[edit]\nDestined for the rabbinate by his parents, Ensheim left his native Metz against his father's will, and for many years led a wandering life.
