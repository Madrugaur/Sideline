{"name": "John Alexander Brodie", "content": "\n John Alexander Brodie (1858 \u2013 1934) was a British civil engineer.[1]\n Brodie began his professional career in 1875 working in the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board engineering department under Chief Engineer George Fosbery Lyster, following this he set up a private consultancy and spent some time working in Spain.[1] In 1889 he invented the goal net for use in football matches and he said that this was the invention of which he was the most proud.[2][3] Brodie returned to Liverpool in 1898 as the city engineer suggesting several improvements for the town such as the UK's first ring road, electric trams and the East Lancashire Road, the UK's first intercity highway.[1]\n He was at the fore front of pre-fabricated housing technology promoting the use of pre-cast reinforced concrete slabs as a means of building houses quickly and cheaply, he presented an example of this technique to the Cheap Cottages Exhibition at Letchworth Garden City. The design attracted attention from across the world and he is known to have influenced Grosvenor Atterbury who used a similar technique to build the houses at Forest Hills Gardens.[1]\n Brodie was also interested in town planning and this was recognised in 1912 when he was asked to help select the site of and plan New Delhi. He visited India twice for this purpose and in 1931 was invited to the official opening ceremony by the Viceroy owing to the high regard that Edwin Lutyens, the chief planner had for him.[1]\n He served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers between 1920 and 1921,[4] becoming the first local authority engineer to receive the accolade.[1] He was also an Associate Professor of Engineering at Liverpool University and vice-president of the Liverpool Self-Propelled Traffic Association which would later become a constituent of the Royal Automobile Club.[1]\n But Brodie's greatest engineering achievement was undoubtedly the Mersey Tunnel completed in 1934 following nine years in the making. At the time of its construction it was the world's longest underwater road tunnel, a title it held for 24 years, and remains to this day the UK's largest municipal engineering project.\n After his death in 1934 Liverpool City Council named Brodie Avenue in his honour.[5]  Brodie's former Liverpool home, 28 Ullet Road, where he lived from 1858 to 1934 is commemorated with an English Heritage blue plaque.[6]\n \n ", "tags": ["British civil engineers", "1858 births", "1934 deaths", "Presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers", "Harbour engineers", "English people of Scottish descent", "Engineers from Liverpool", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Use dmy dates from April 2018", "Use British English from April 2018", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from January 2018", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "For other people named John Brodie, see John Brodie (disambiguation).\n\n\nJohn Alexander BrodieBorn1858Died1934NationalityBritishOccupationEngineerEngineering careerDisciplineCivilInstitutionsInstitution of Civil Engineers (president),\n\nJohn Alexander Brodie (1858 \u2013 1934) was a British civil engineer.[1]\nBrodie began his professional career in 1875 working in the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board engineering department under Chief Engineer George Fosbery Lyster, following this he set up a private consultancy and spent some time working in Spain.[1] In 1889 he invented the goal net for use in football matches and he said that this was the invention of which he was the most proud.[2][3] Brodie returned to Liverpool in 1898 as the city engineer suggesting several improvements for the town such as the UK's first ring road, electric trams and the East Lancashire Road, the UK's first intercity highway.[1]\nHe was at the fore front of pre-fabricated housing technology promoting the use of pre-cast reinforced concrete slabs as a means of building houses quickly and cheaply, he presented an example of this technique to the Cheap Cottages Exhibition at Letchworth Garden City.
