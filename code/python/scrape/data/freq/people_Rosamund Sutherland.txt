After she and her family moved to Hertfordshire, she taught for The Open University and the Borehamwood College of Further Education. Through her position at The Open University she came to work with Celia Hoyles, who encouraged her to become an academic researcher in a project combining mathematics education with computer programming in the Logo programming language. She worked at the University of London from 1983 until 1995, when she was given a Chair in Education at the University of Bristol.[1][2]\n At Bristol, in 1997, she chaired a national committee that helped bring algebra to a more prominent position in secondary-school mathematics education.[1][3] She was the head of the school from 2003 to 2006, and again in 2014.
