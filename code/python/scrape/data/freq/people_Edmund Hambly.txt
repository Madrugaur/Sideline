{"name": "Edmund Hambly", "content": "\n Dr Edmund Cadbury Hambly (28 September 1942 \u2013 28 March 1995) was a British structural engineer.\n Edmund Hambly was born in Seer Green, near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire in 1942.[2] He went to Eton College prior to studying the engineering tripos at Cambridge University. He excelled there gaining a first class honours degree and claiming the prize in structural engineering. Staying at Cambridge as a fellow of Emmanuel College[1] he completed his doctorate following work on soil deformation models. It was here that he met and married Elizabeth Gorham with whom he would have three daughters and a son.[citation needed]\n Hambly left academia to spend five years working with Ove Arup and Partners in the design of structures and Gifford and Partners in bridge building. He devised new models and work methods for the approximation of structural behaviour which he published in 1976 in his first book, Bridge Deck Behaviour.[2] In 1974 he set up his own consultancy and worked from his home in Hertfordshire, writing more than 40 technical papers to supplement his income. One of his first contracts was to investigate the design of bridge foundations for the Building Research Establishment, publishing some of his findings in Bridge Foundations and Substructures in 1979. He was asked by the oil and gas extraction industries to advise upon offshore platforms damaged by wave fatigue and collisions.[citation needed]\n His expertise in the industry was widely recognized and he was created a fellow of the Institution of Structural Engineers in 1982, of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1984 and of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1991. He also served as chairman of the Offshore Engineering Society between 1989 and 1990.[3]\n He worked as a visiting professor at Oxford University from 1989 to 1992 lecturing in structural analysis, he wrote his third book, Structural Analysis by Example (1994) to provide examples of calculations for students.\n Hambly had a keen interest in the provision of better social housing and encouraging community spirit as well as a quaker upbringing, he united these beliefs in his service as a trustee to the Bournville Village Trust between 1979 and 1988.[2]\n He was created a fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1990 and was keen to use this to promote engineering to young people and society as a whole. He was elected vice-president in 1991 and President in 1994.[4] He used his inaugural address to show the need to attract students into engineering degrees and to provide more sustainable solutions to engineering problems.[2] However he died in London on 28 March 1995, just five months into his one-year presidency. A prize in his honour is awarded annually by the Institution of Civil Engineers for contributions to sustainability in the industry. He was posthumously awarded an honorary doctorate of science by Nottingham University in 1996.[5]\n \n ", "tags": ["English civil engineers", "People educated at Eton College", "Presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers", "British structural engineers", "1942 births", "1995 deaths", "People from Beaconsfield", "Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering", "Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge", "Fellows of Emmanuel College, Cambridge", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from May 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Use dmy dates from February 2015", "Use British English from February 2015", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2021", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nFor the British politician and surgeon, see Edmund Henry Hambly.\nEdmund Cadbury HamblyBorn28 September 1942Seer Green, BeaconsfieldDied28 March 1995(1995-03-28) (aged\u00a052)NationalityBritishEducationEton College and Trinity College, Cambridge[1]OccupationEngineerEngineering careerDisciplineCivil,InstitutionsInstitution of Civil Engineers (president),Offshore Engineering Society (chairman),Institution of Structural Engineers (fellow),Institution of Mechanical Engineers (fellow),Royal Academy of Engineering (fellow),\n\nDr Edmund Cadbury Hambly (28 September 1942 \u2013 28 March 1995) was a British structural engineer.\nEdmund Hambly was born in Seer Green, near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire in 1942.[2] He went to Eton College prior to studying the engineering tripos at Cambridge University.
