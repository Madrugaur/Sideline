He is the founder, chief executive officer, Co-chief investment officer, and 85% owner of Citadel LLC,[3][4] which had $38 billion of assets under management as of March 2021.[5] Citadel Securities, a market maker, handles 40% of the stock trades in the United States.[6][7]\n Frequently one of the highest earning hedge fund managers, earning in excess of $1 billion per year, Griffin has an estimated net worth of either US$16 billion[1] or US$22.4 billion[2], making him the 2nd richest person in Illinois and the 45th richest person in America.[1][8]\n Griffin has contributed tens of millions of dollars to political candidates and causes, primarily those of the Republican Party. He owns an art collection valued at $800 million and personal residences valued in total at over $1 billion. His purchases of residences in London and New York City, for $122 million and $238 million, respectively, broke records for the highest prices paid for residences in those cities. He guards his private life and often buys the rights to photos of him to keep them out of circulation. His divorce with Anne Dias-Griffin in 2015 was highly publicized.\n Griffin is known for his incendiary temper and aggressive personality, which has resulted in turnover at Citadel.[9]\n Griffin was born in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida, the son of a building supplies executive.[10] Griffin's father was a project manager for General Electric.[11] Griffin's grandmother, Genevieve Huebsch Gratz, inherited an oil business, three farms, and a seed business.[12]\n Griffin grew up in Boca Raton, Florida, with some time in Texas, and Wisconsin.[13] He went to middle school in Boca Raton[11] followed by Boca Raton Community High School, where he was the president of the math club.[13][14] In high school, Griffin ran a discount mail-order education software firm out of his bedroom called EDCOM.[14] In a 1986 article in the Sun-Sentinel, Griffin stated that he thinks he will become a businessman or lawyer and that he believes the job market for computer programmers will significantly decrease over the coming decade.[14]\n Griffin started at Harvard College in the fall of 1986.[13] That year, one of his first investments was to buy put options on Home Shopping Network, making a $5,000 profit.[15] He also invested in convertible arbitrage opportunities in convertible bonds, convertible into stock.[13] Despite a ban on running businesses from campus, Griffin convinced school administrators to allow him to install a satellite dish on the roof of the Cabot House dormitory to receive stock quotes.[15][13] He also asked Terrence J. O\u2019Connor, the manager of convertible bonds at Merrill Lynch in Boston, to open a brokerage account for him with $100,000 that Griffin had gotten from his grandmother, his dentist, and others.[11][13] His first fund launched in 1987 with $265,000, days after his 19th birthday.[13] The fund launched in time to profit from short positions on Black Monday (1987).[13] Griffin graduated in 1989 with a degree in economics.[16]\n After graduating in 1989, Griffin moved to Chicago to work with Frank Meyer, founder of Glenwood Capital Investments.[17] Meyer allotted $1 million of Glenwood capital for Griffin to trade[17] and Griffin made 70% in a year.[13]\n A year later, in 1990, Griffin founded Citadel LLC, with assets under management of $4.6 million, aided by contributions from Meyer.[17] His funds made 43% in 1991 and 40% in 1992.[15]\n In 2003, aged 34, Griffin was the youngest self-made individual on the Forbes 400 with an estimated net worth of $650 million.[18]\n From the time of his marriage in 2003 until late 2009, Griffin was the lead investor in Aragon Global Management, a hedge fund run by his then-wife Anne Dias-Griffin. The fund was also seeded with money from Julian Robertson. Ken lost 20% of his investment in the fund.[19]\n In 2006, Citadel acquired the positions of Amaranth Advisors at a steep discount.[13]\n During the financial crisis of 2007-2008, for 10 months, Griffin barred his investors from withdrawing money, attracting criticism.[4][20] At the peak of the crisis, the firm was losing \"hundreds of millions of dollars each week\".[21] It was leveraged 7:1 and the biggest funds at Citadel finished 2008 down 55%. However, they rebounded with a 62% return in 2009.[13]\n In 2008, Griffin's Citadel indirectly received $200 million in U.S. taxpayer money as a result of the American International Group bailout.[22][23]\n From Citadel LLC, Griffin earned $900 million in 2009,[24] $1.4 billion in 2014[25] $600 million in 2016,[26] $1.4 billion in 2017,[27][28] $870 million in 2018,[29] $1.5 billion in 2019,[30] and $1.8 billion in 2020.[31]\n In November 2020, according to Bloomberg News Griffin's net worth surpassed $20 billion due to an increase the value of Citadel, of which Griffin's stake was worth $11.2 billion.[3] Citadel Securities, a market maker, increased its profit to $2.36 billion during the first half of 2020 compared to $982 million for the same period in 2019 due to increased volatility, volume and retail trader engagement.[32][33]\n In January 2021, Griffin attracted criticism for the role played by Citadel in the GameStop short squeeze.[34] On January 25, it was announced that Griffin's Citadel would invest $2 billion into Melvin Capital, which had suffered losses of more than 30% on account of its short positions, particularly on GameStop.[35][36][37] On January 28, Robinhood, an electronic trading platform favored by many traders involved in buying GameStop stock and options, abruptly announced that it would halt all purchases of GameStop securities except to cover shorts and would only allow these securities to be sold if already held (but not sold short); the price of GME stock declined steeply shortly thereafter.[38] Because Robinhood receives a substantial portion of its revenue through a payment for order flow relationship with Citadel Securities LLC, 85% of which is owned by Griffin, many commentators criticized the potential for a conflict of interest when the same entity both plays the role of market-maker and also participates in the market that it makes; Griffin personally has been at the center of much discussion on this controversy.[39][40][41][42][43] On February 18, 2021, Griffin testified before the House Financial Services Committee to address his role in the GameStop controversy;[43][44] Griffin has donated money directly to four congresspeople on the committee, including Republicans French Hill, Andy Barr, Ann Wagner, and Bill Huizenga.[43]\n In 2012, Griffin identified as a Reagan Republican in an interview with the Chicago Tribune. He said the belief \"that a larger government is what creates prosperity, that a larger government is what creates good\" is wrong.[45]\n In April 2016, because Citadel owned over 1 million shares of McDonald's, Griffin was the target of protestors supporting the Fight for $15.[46]\n During an interview with David Rubenstein Griffin criticized Elizabeth Warren's proposals saying \"soaking the rich doesn't work\".[47] Griffin has been criticized by Elizabeth Warren for his real estate purchases.[48]\n In September 2020, Griffin wrote an op-ed published in the Chicago Tribune stating his opposition to Governor of Illinois J. B. Pritzker's \"Fair Tax\" proposal that would change Illinois income tax from a flat tax to a graduated tax.[49][50]\n In an October 2020 email to Citadel LLC's Chicago employees, Griffin criticized Pritzker's tax plan and alluded to the possibility of moving his company out of Illinois.[51][52]\n In October 2017, Griffin's charitable fund donated $1 million to the Obama Foundation.[53][54]\n Griffin did not attend a signing ceremony for the phase-one trade deal with China at the White House, for which he was criticized by President Donald Trump.[55][56][57][58]\n Griffin criticized Donald Trump's tweets berating Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell calling the tweets \"completely inappropriate for the president of the United States\".[59][60][61][57]\n While being interviewed by Paul Tudor Jones at the Robin Hood Foundation investor conference in October 2020, Griffin criticized Joe Biden's plans to raise the long-term capital gains tax rate.[62][63]\n In a 2012 interview, Griffin said that people should be able to make unlimited contributions to politicians, but that these contributions should be public.[64]\n During the 2010 United States elections, Griffin donated $721,600 to federal candidates and political committees. Except for a $2,400 contribution to then United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Chairman Chris Dodd, all of the contributions were to Republicans.[65]\n Griffin has made political donations to conservative political candidates, parties, and organizations such as American Crossroads and the Republican Governors Association.[64]\n In 2015, Griffin donated $5.855 million to Conservative Solutions Project, Freedom Partners Action Fund, Right to Rise, and Future45.[66]\n In December 2015, Griffin endorsed Marco Rubio for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and stated that he planned to donate millions to a pro-Rubio super PAC.[67] Before this endorsement, Griffin had donated $100,000 each to three super PACs supporting Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker for the GOP nomination.[68]\n In March 2020, Griffin contributed $1 million to the 1820 PAC created to support the re-election bid of U. S. Senator Susan Collins in Maine.[69] In late 2020, Griffin donated another $500,000 to the 1820 PAC.[70]\n Griffin supported Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in the 2020\u201321 United States Senate election in Georgia.[71] In October 2020, He was criticized for a $2 million contribution to a Super PAC supporting Loeffler and funded by her husband, New York Stock Exchange Chairman Jeffrey Sprecher, just after one of Citadel LLC's companies needed approval from Sprecher for a merger.[72]\n \nGriffin has individually supported many candidates including:[74] In 2020, Griffin donated $20 million to the Coalition To Stop The Proposed Tax Hike Amendment, a group opposing the Illinois Fair Tax in its 2020 referendum.[50][75] Weeks later, he donated another $26.75 million to the coalition.[76][77] Griffin later donated another $7 million to the group bringing his total contributions to $53.75 million.[78][79]\n In 2020, Griffin donated $2 million to an anti-retention effort for Justice Thomas L. Kilbride, a democrat on the Supreme Court of Illinois.[80][81]\n In October 2009, Griffin and his wife founded the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation. The foundation is particularly focused on donations to public education and libraries.[10]\n The Griffins have previously worked with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in the promotion of charter schools in the US.[13] The couple have worked with University of Chicago economics professor John A. List to test whether investment in teachers or in parents produces better student performance outcomes.[82]\n At the beginning of 2014, Griffin made a $150 million donation to the financial aid program at Harvard University, his alma mater, the largest single donation ever made to the institution at the time.[83]\n In 2014, he was elected to a five-year term on the University of Chicago's board of trustees. He is also a member several organizations including the Economic Club of Chicago, and the civic committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago.[84] Griffin is the vice chairman of the Chicago Public Education Fund.[83]\n In November 2017, the Kenneth C. Griffin Charitable Fund announced that it intends to make a $125 million gift to support the Department of Economics of the University of Chicago, which will be renamed the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics.[85]\n In April 2021, he donated $5 million to an initiative to provide Internet access to students in Miami.[86]\n Griffin donated $21.5 million to the Field Museum of Natural History and its dinosaur exhibit is named the Griffin Dinosaur Experience.[87]\n In October 2019, the Kenneth C. Griffin Charitable fund announced a $125 million gift to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, the largest gift in the museum's history. The museum will be renamed the Kenneth C. Griffin Museum of Science and Industry.[88][89]\n In 2010, Griffin contributed to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's productions at Millennium Park.[10] He supported the University of Chicago's Center for Urban School Improvement, a program encouraging the construction of an inner-city charter high school.[10] That same year, Griffin contributed to the Lurie Children's Hospital.[90]\n In 2017, Griffin contributed $15 million to the Robin Hood Foundation.[91]\n In March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Griffin contributed $2.5 million to \"the fund to support food services for Chicago Public School families\". $1 million of that donation went to Chicago Public Schools and the rest was directed to the Greater Chicago Food Depository.[92]\n Griffin is an active modern and contemporary art buyer.[98] He buys art from mainstream artists.[99] His portfolio is valued at close to $800 million.[100]\n Griffin's collection of modern paintings include his purchase in 1999, of Paul C\u00e9zanne's painting Curtain, Jug and Fruit Bowl for a record $60 million at the time.[13] Griffin's 2016 purchases from David Geffen of Willem de Kooning's 1955 oil painting, Interchange for $300\u00a0million, and Jackson Pollock's 1948 painting, Number 17A, for $200\u00a0million.[101]\n In terms of contemporary art, Griffin purchased False Start by artist Jasper Johns for $80\u00a0million in October 2006 from David Geffen.[102] In 2015, he purchased Gerhard Richter's 1986 painting Abstract Picture, 599 for $46 million.[99]\n Griffin has donated money to multiple art museums, beginning primarily in the 2000s. He has been on the Board of Trustees of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago since 2000 and regularly supports its exhibitions.[103]\n In July 2007, Griffin donated a $19 million addition to the Art Institute of Chicago that was designed by Renzo Piano and named Kenneth and Anne Griffin Court.[104] The Paul C\u00e9zanne paintings have also been loaned to the institute.[10]\n As of 2010, Griffin had contributed to the Art Institute of Chicago.[13] He serves on the Board of Trustees at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York as of 2010, whose lobby bears his name: Kenneth C. Griffin Hall.[98] In February 2015, Griffin donated $10 million to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and used to create the Griffin Galleries of Contemporary Art.[103][105]\n In December 2015, he donated an unrestricted $40 million to the Museum of Modern Art in New York.[98]\n In June 2020, it was reported that Griffin purchased Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump (1982) by Jean-Michel Basquiat for upwards of $100 million.[106] It is among the most expensive paintings ever purchased. Griffin announced the artwork would be put on public display.[107] He loaned the painting to the Art Institute of Chicago.[108]\n Griffin owns personal residences valued in total at around $1 billion.[109]\n In 2011, Griffin purchased two oceanfront homes at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai for $28 million.[109][110][111][112]\n In 2019, Griffin purchased 3 Carlton Gardens, a Georgian mansion in London for $122 million. The purchase broke several records.[113][114][115][116]\n In 2019 Griffin set the record for the most expensive residential sale ever closed in the US when he purchased roughly 24,000 square feet across three floors at 220 Central Park South for $238 million. The space was \"raw space\" meaning Griffin had to build it out.[109][117][118][119][120] Several New York real estate experts have said that the purchase helped fuel legislation that increased taxes on luxury homes in New York.[109][121][122][123] During an interview with David Rubenstein Griffin said that the purchase represented the possibility of making New York City his home in the future.[124]\n In 2009 Griffin purchased a full floor apartment at 820 Fifth Avenue in New York City for $40 million.[109][125][126]\n In 2015 Griffin purchased two apartments at the top of the Faena House, a condominium in Miami Beach for $60 million. Griffin later put the two apartments on the market for $73 million but they didn't attract a buyer and were taken off the market.[109][127][128][129]\n For a decade Griffin has been buying large parcels of land in Palm Beach to assemble one of the largest private waterfront sites in the county with plans to build a grand estate. As of October 2020, these purchases total to $350 million.[109][130][131][132][133]\n In 2017, Griffin who is a resident of Chicago, purchased a penthouse apartment atop the No. 9 Walton a luxury condo tower. The purchase broke the record for the most expensive sale in Chicago's history. The condo was delivered as \"raw space\" so that Griffin could build it out to his liking.[109][134][135][136] Griffin also owns a full floor penthouse at the Waldorf Astoria private residences across the street from No. 9 Walton. Records show he purchased the penthouse for $6.884 million in 2010.[109]\n In early 2020, Griffin purchased a oceanfront compound in The Hamptons from fashion designer Calvin Klein in an off-market deal that reportedly closed at close to $100 million.[137][138][139][140][141][142][143]\n In 2013 and 2015, Griffin purchased homes in Aspen, Colorado for $10 million and $12.8 million respectively.[109][144][145][146]\n In August 2020, Griffin purchased three properties on Miami's Star Island for $60 million.[147][148][149]\n Griffin's first wife was Katherine Weingartt, his high school sweetheart. The couple divorced in 1996.[150][151]\n In 2002, Griffin met his second wife Anne Dias-Griffin after being setup on a blind date by a mutual friend.[152] She is a French-born graduate of Harvard Business School who worked at Goldman Sachs, Soros Fund Management, and Viking Global prior to starting Chicago-based $55 million firm[153] Aragon Global Management.[154] The couple married in July 2003[19] and had three children.[154] A 2007 profile of the couple states \"Anne Dias Griffin is the champagne to Ken Griffin\u2019s Budweiser.\"[155]\n In July 2014, Mr. Griffin filled a divorce petition in Cook County, Illinois citing \"irreconcilable differences\" with his wife.[156][157][158] According to the divorce petition filled by Mr. Griffin, the couple had entered into a prenuptial agreement which governed the split of their assets in the event of a divorce.[154][159][160][161] As part of the prenuptial agreement, Ms. Anne Griffin received $22.5 million at the beginning of their marriage and received an additional $1 million each year they were married.[156][159] During the marriage, she received $37 million in cash payments and 50% ownership of their Chicago penthouse.[162] In court fillings, Ms. Dias Griffin claimed that she was forced to sign the prenuptial agreement.[163][164][165] In later court filings Ms. Anne Griffin requested $1 million per month in child support payments.[166] Griffin paid $11.75 million to buy out his wife's interest in their Chicago penthouse.[167] The breakdown included $300,000 per month for private jet travel, $160k per month for vacation rentals and $60,000 per month for office space and staff.[168][169][170] Mr. Griffin claimed that Ms. Anne Griffin was attempting to use child support to fund her \"opulent lifestyle\".[171] During the divorce, Ms. Anne Griffin requested $450,000 for a 10-day vacation to St. Barts over winter break with their 3 children. Mr. Griffin denied her request but agreed to pay $45,000 for a winter vacation.[172][173][152] Mr. Griffin and Ms. Anne Griffin finalized their divorce in October 2015.[174] The divorce was settled out of court just hours before a public trial over the prenup agreement was set to begin.[156] Mr. Griffin maintains joint custody of his children with his ex-wife.[156][175][176][177][178][163] In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Griffin called the experience \"a chapter I wish I could edit out\".[179][180]\n Griffin is a member of the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago.[181] In 2011, Griffin donated $11 million of the $38.2 million needed to build a new chapel at the church.[181] The modern building is called \"The Gratz Center\" in honor of Griffin's grandparents.[181]\n Griffin is very media-shy and rarely gives interviews.[57][182][183] Griffin often buys the rights to photos of him to keep them out of circulation.[155] During a 2007 interview, he said \"We zealously guard our private life\".[155]\n ", "tags": ["1968 births", "20th-century American businesspeople", "21st-century American businesspeople", "American billionaires", "American financial
