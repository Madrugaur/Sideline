After earning an AB from Harvard College, he continued at Harvard to study for a PhD under Phillip Griffiths.\n During the 1980s, he was on the faculty of Brown University, moving to Harvard around 1988.[citation needed] He served as chair of the department at Harvard from 2002 to 2005.  His work is characterized by its classical geometric flavor: he has claimed that nothing he thinks about could not have been imagined by the Italian geometers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and that if he has had greater success than them, it is because he has access to better tools.[citation needed]\n Harris is well known for several of his books on algebraic geometry, notable for their informal presentations:\n As of 2018, Harris has supervised 50 PhD students, including Brendan Hassett, James McKernan, Rahul Pandharipande, Zvezdelina Stankova, and Ravi Vakil.[4]\n ", "tags": ["1951 births", "Living people", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Algebraic geometers", "Brown University faculty", "Central High School (Philadelphia) alumni", "Harvard University alumni", "Harvard University faculty", "CS1 maint: untitled periodical", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from September 2008", "Articles with unsourced statements from September 2009", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nThis article is about Joe Harris, the mathematician.
