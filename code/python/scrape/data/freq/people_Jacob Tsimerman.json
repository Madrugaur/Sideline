He obtained his PhD degree from Princeton University in 2011 under the guidance of Peter Clive Sarnak.[1] He was awarded the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize in the year 2015 in recognition for his work on the Andr\u00e9\u2013Oort conjecture and for his work in both analytic number theory and algebraic geometry.[2]\n Jacob Tsimerman was born in Kazan, Russia, on April 26, 1988. In 1990 his family first moved to Israel and then in 1996 to Canada.  In  2003 and 2004 he represented Canada in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and won gold medals both years, with a perfect score in 2004.[3]\n Following his PhD, he had a post-doctoral position at Harvard University as a Junior Fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows. In July 2014 he was awarded a Sloan Fellowship and he started his term as assistant professor at the University of Toronto. As of 2019, he is an associate professor.[4]  He was awarded the 2016 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize.[5]\n Tsimerman has worked at Radix Trading LLC developing quantitative trading models [6]\n Together with Jonathan Pila, Tsimerman demonstrated the Andr\u00e9\u2013Oort conjecture for Siegel modular varieties.
