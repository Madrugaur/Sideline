A major focus of his research has been to identify mechanisms that regulate neuronal connectivity and the effects of neuronal activity on brain development.[2] He served as the Global Head of Neuroscience Discovery at F. Hoffmann-La Roche from 2011 to 2016 and as founding CSO of E-Scape Bio from 2016-2017. He was the Head of Research and Early Development at Biogen from 2017-2020 and is currently the CEO of Unity Biotechnology.[3][4][5]\n Anirvan Ghosh was born in 1964 in Bloomington, Indiana and grew up in Kanpur, India. After completing high school at Central School (Kendriya Vidyalaya) IIT Kanpur, he moved to the U.S. to pursue his undergraduate education at the California Institute of Technology. He graduated with a B.S. with honors in Physics from Caltech in 1985.  From 1985 to 1990 he was a graduate student in the Stanford University Neurosciences Graduate Program, where he worked on the role of subplate neurons in establishing cortical connections in the laboratory of Carla J. Shatz. He received his Ph.D. in Neurobiology from Stanford University in 1991. His postdoctoral training was with Michael E. Greenberg at Harvard Medical School where he worked on regulation of differentiation by extracellular signals and calcium regulation of BDNF expression. From 1995 to 2003 he was on the faculty in the Department of Neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.[1]  While at Johns Hopkins he cloned CREST as a calcium-regulated transcription factor and showed that it plays a critical role in brain development.[6] In 2003 he moved to  UCSD as the Stephen Kuffler Professor and served as Chair of Neurobiology in the Division of Biological Sciences. Ghosh served as the Global Head of Neuroscience Discovery at Roche from 2011-2016 [3] and as the Head of Research and Early Development at Biogen from 2017-2020.[4] Since 2020 he has served as CEO of UNITY Biotechnology, a company focused on developing therapies to slow, halt, or reverse diseases of aging.\n ", "tags": ["1964 births", "Bengali scientists", "American people of Bengali descent", "American neuroscientists", "People from Kanpur", "California Institute of Technology alumni", "Stanford University alumni", "Harvard Medical School alumni", "Johns Hopkins University faculty", "University of California, San Diego faculty", "Living people", "Kendriya Vidyalaya alumni", "Bengali people", "American academics of Indian descent", "Scientists from California", "BLP articles lacking sources from January 2008", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Articles containing Bengali-language text", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "This biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.
