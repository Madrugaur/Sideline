He developed an easily recognizable style of Late Baroque, both sumptuous and majestic. His major works, including the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg and the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo, are famed for extravagant luxury and opulence of decoration.[1]\n In 1716, Bartolomeo moved to Saint Petersburg, which became a new Russian capital just a four years before, accompanying his father, Italian sculptor Carlo Bartolomeo Rastrelli (1675\u20131744).[1] His ambition was to combine the latest Italian architectural fashion with traditions of the Muscovite Baroque style. The first important commission came in 1721 when he was asked to build a palace for Prince Demetre Cantemir, former ruler of Moldavia.\n He was appointed to the post of senior court architect in 1730. His works found favour with female monarchs of his time, and he retained this post throughout the reigns of Empresses Anna (1730\u20131740) and Elizabeth (1741\u20131762).\n Rastrelli's last and most ambitious project was the Smolny Convent in St. Petersburg where Empress Elizabeth was to spend the rest of her life. The projected bell-tower was to become the tallest building in St Petersburg and all of Russia. Elizabeth's death in 1762 prevented Rastrelli from completing this grand design.[1]\n The new empress, Catherine II, dismissed Baroque architecture as an old-fashioned \"whipped cream\", and the aged architect retired to Courland, where he supervised the completion and decoration of the ducal palaces.\n His last years were spent in obscure commerce with Italian art-dealers. He was elected to the Imperial Academy of Arts several months before his death.[1] A square in front of the Smolny Convent has borne Rastrelli's name since 1923. He is the subject of a composition, Rastrelli in Saint Petersburg, written in 2000 by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero.\n Boris Vipper has speculated that Rastrelli's last (and unfinished) design was for the Neoclassical Za\u013cenieki Manor near Mitava.\n ", "tags": ["Italian Baroque architects", "Russian Baroque architects", "Rococo architects", "18th-century Italian architects", "18th-century Russian architects", "Italian emigrants to the Russian Empire", "1700 births", "1771 deaths", "Court of Elizabeth of Russia", "Bartolomeo Rastrelli buildings", "Use dmy dates from April 2012", "Commons link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with IEU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "\"Bartolomeo Rastrelli\" redirects here.
