His work on the research of this disease won him the Royal Society's 1952 Buchanan Medal for \"outstanding research\" on the Anopheles mosquito that transmitted malaria. In his career he also contributed to the taxonomy of other parasites.\n ", "tags": ["1873 births", "1978 deaths", "People educated at Liverpool Institute High School for Boys", "Medical doctors from Liverpool", "British zoologists", "British entomologists", "English centenarians", "Malariologists", "Manson medal winners", "British parasitologists", "Scientists from Liverpool", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Naturalists of British India", "Indian Medical Service officers", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from April 2018", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Use dmy dates from March 2021", "Use British English from April 2012", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nRickard ChristophersBornSamuel Rickard Christophers(1873-11-27)27 November 1873Died19 February 1978(1978-02-19) (aged\u00a0104)AwardsManson Medal (1944)Buchanan Medal (1952)Fellow of the Royal Society[1]\nBrevet Colonel Sir (Samuel) Rickard Christophers CIE OBE FRS[1] (27 November 1873 \u2013 19 February 1978[2]) was a British protozoologist and medical entomologist specialising in mosquitoes.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Education\n2 Career\n3 Personal life\n4 Awards\n5 Works\n6 References\n\n\nEducation[edit]\nChristophers was born and raised in Liverpool, the son of Samuel Hunt Christophers and Mary Selina Christophers n\u00e9e Rickard and educated at the Liverpool Institute and University of Liverpool, graduating MB in 1896.\n\nCareer[edit]\nIn 1897, he took part in an Amazonian expedition and in 1898 went to Italy as part of the Malaria Commission, followed by a trip to Africa to study malaria.
