She administered Polio vaccine to children as part of the trip.[68]\nAs a celebrity ambassador for the British Red Cross,[69] Huq appeared in the 2009 video \"If I had HIV, would you kiss me?\" which was part of a campaign against the stigmatisation of people living with HIV and AIDS.[70][71] She was an ambassador for Gold Challenge, part of the official mass participation legacy programme for the London 2012 Olympic Games.[72][73]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nOn 26 July 2010, Huq married writer and satirist Charlie Brooker at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas after a nine-month relationship.[74][75] They have two sons.[76] Huq has said that she reduced her television commitments so that she could focus on her children.[77]\nHuq supported the Labour Party at the 2010 general election.[78] Her sister, Rupa, was elected as the Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton at the 2015 general election.[79]\nOn 6 April 2008, Huq participated in the London leg of the Summer Olympics torch relay as one of 80 torch carriers on the torch's journey to Beijing. In Ladbroke Grove, a protester tried to grab the torch from her as she was about to hand it to the next runner. She was not hurt in the incident, though police wrestled the protester to the ground and arrested him.[80]\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\n\nYear\nTitle\nRole\nRef.\n\n\n1991\nTVFM\nPresenter\n[12]\n\n\n1992\nBlockbusters\nContestant\n[10]\n\n\n2point4 Children\nExtra\n[11]\n\n\n1993\nEat Your Words\nMain presenter alongside Simon Parkin\n[13]\n\n\n1997\nThe Mag\nPresenter for Channel 5's youth show\n[81]\n\n\nMilkshake!\nMain presenter alongside Lucy Alexander\n[14]\n\n\n1997\u20132008\nBlue Peter\nMain presenter alongside various co-presenters\n[23]\n\n\n2001\nThe Kumars at No 42\nHerself\n[45]\n\n\n2002\u20132004\nUK Top 40\nMain presenter alongside Adrian Dickson\n[24]\n\n\n2005\nComic Relief Does Fame Academy\nContestant (out third)\n[64]\n\n\n2006\nThe Tube\nMain presenter alongside Tony Wilson, Alex James and Emily Rose\n[40]\n\n\n2007\nThe Sarah Jane Adventures\nCameo appearance in the episode Invasion of the Bane\n[46]\n\n\nM.I.High\nMinor character\n[47]\n\n\n8 out of 10 Cats\nPanellist\n[27]\n\n\nNew York Fashion Week\nMain presenter for GMTV coverage\n[26]\n\n\nLondon Talking\nMain presenter alongside Vanessa Feltz and Nick Ferrari\n[26]\n\n\nRobin Hood\nA servant called Konnie\n[49]\n\n\n2008\nYour News\nMain presenter alongside Laura Jones, Manish Bhasin and Adam Parsons\n[29]\n\n\nThe Weakest Link\nContestant on Blue Peter special\n[82]\n\n\nUK School Games\nMain presenter alongside Nigel Clarke\n[45]\n\n\nWhen Beauty Goes Wrong\nMain presenter\n[45]\n\n\nCharlie Brooker's Screenwipe\nPresenter of the mock documentary in Episode 4 \"Konnie's Great British Wee\"\n[33]\n\n\nAre You Smarter Than A 10 Year Old?\nContestant\n[83]\n\n\n2008\u20132009\nZoo Days\nPresenter of the Colchester edition of the show\n[30]\n\n\n2009\nNoel's HQ\nReporter\n[84]\n\n\nGuinness World Records Smashed\nMain presenter alongside Steve Jones\n[35]\n\n\nHannah-Oke\nMain presenter alongside Duncan James\n[36]\n\n\nThe Wright Stuff\nPanellist for the Week\n[45]\n\n\nThe Daily Politics\nGuest reporter\n[85]\n\n\nJack Osbourne: Adrenaline Junkie\nCelebrity participant\n[86]\n\n\n2010\nThe Archive Hour: Open Sesame\nGuest reporter\n[43]\n\n\nThe Xtra Factor\nMain presenter from Series 7\n[37]\n\n\nMind Your Language\nMain presenter\n[87]\n\n\n71 Degrees North\nContestant Series 1\n[45]\n\n\nThis Week\nGuest reporter\n[34]\n\n\nShocked Britain\nMain presenter\n[7]\n\n\n2011\nLonely Planet\nReporter\n[88]\n\n\nWould I Lie to You?\nGuest panellist\n[89]\n\n\nUnder Pressure\nHerself\n[38]\n\n\n2012\nThe Real Hustle: Celebrity Chancers\nCelebrity Hustler\n[90]\n\n\nPointless Celebrities\nContestant paired with Angellica Bell\n[91]\n\n\nCelebrity Blockbusters\nContestant\n[92]\n\n\nThis Week\nGuest reporter\n[34]\n\n\n2013\nDaybreak\nGuest reporter\n[93]\n\n\nA Touch of Cloth Series II\nHerself\n[50]\n\n\nGreat Lives\nEpisode 31: Ada Lovelace\n[44]\n\n\n2015\nKing of the Nerds\nMain Presenter\n[62]\n\n\nThis Morning\nGuest\n[94]\n\n\nSunday Brunch\nGuest\n[95]\n\n\n2016\nThe One Show\nPresenter\n[62]\n\n\nThe Penguin Podcast\nPodcast interview with James Oswald\n[96]\n\n\n2017\nThe Penguin Podcast\nPodcast interviews with Tom Fletcher, Harriet Harman, Jo Nesbo and Carlo Rovelli\n[97][98][99][100]\n\n\n2019\nGood Omens\nPam\n[51]\n\n\nSunday Brunch\nHerself\n[95]\n\n\n2020\nGreat British Menu\nHerself\n[101]\n\n\nCharlie Brooker's Antiviral Wipe\nHerself (also Autocue Op and Hair and Make-up)\n[102]\n\nBibliography[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nPublisher\n\nISBN\n\n\n2020\n\nCookie and the Most Annoying Boy in the World\n\nPiccadilly Press\n\nISBN\u00a0978-1-8481-2809-5\n\n\n2020\n\nCookie and the Most Annoying Girl in the World\n\nPiccadilly Press\n\nISBN\u00a0978-1-8481-2893-4\n\n\n2020\n\nFearless Fairy Tales\n\nPiccadilly Press\n\nISBN\u00a0978-1-8481-2811-8\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of British Bangladeshis\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Ella Joynes (August 2018).
