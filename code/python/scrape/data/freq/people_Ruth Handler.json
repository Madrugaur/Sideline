{"name": "Ruth Handler", "content": "Ruth Marianna Handler (n\u00e9e Mosko; November 4, 1916 \u2013 April 27, 2002) was an American businesswoman and inventor. She served as the president of the toy manufacturer Mattel Inc., In 1959, she invented the Barbie doll, which sold over a billion worldwide. She was the founder and president of the world's largest toy company, which at its peak had 18,000 employees and annual sales of over $300 million. In 1974, the Handlers were forced to resign from Mattel, and in 1978 Ruth Handler was convicted of false reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission.[2]\n Handler was born Ruth Marianna Mosko in Denver, Colorado, to Polish-Jewish immigrants Ida Mosko (n\u00e9e Rubenstein) and Jacob Mosko.[3] She married her high school boyfriend, Elliot Handler, and moved to Los Angeles in 1938.[4]  Her husband decided to make their furniture out of two newfound types of plastics, Lucite and Plexiglas. Ruth Handler suggested that he start doing this commercially and they began a furniture business. Ruth Handler worked as the sales force for the new business, landing contracts with Douglas Aircraft Company and others.[4]\n Her husband Elliot Handler and his business partner Harold \"Matt\" Matson formed a small company to manufacture picture frames, calling it \"Mattel\" by combining part of their names (\"Matt\" and \"Elliot\"). Later, they began using scraps from the manufacturing process to make dollhouse furniture. The furniture was more profitable than the picture frames and it was decided to concentrate on toy manufacturing. The company's first big-seller was the \"Uke-a-doodle\", a toy ukulele.\n Ruth Handler claimed her daughter Barbara, who was becoming a pre-teen, played with paper dolls by pretending they were adults. Handler noticed that in such play, children would act out future events, rather than the present. Handler noted the limitations of the paper dolls, including how the paper clothing failed to attach well. She wanted to produce a three-dimensional plastic \"paper doll\" with an adult body and a wardrobe of fabric clothing, but her husband and Mr. Matson thought parents would not buy their children a doll with a voluptuous figure. While the Handler family was vacationing in Europe, Ruth Handler saw the West German Bild Lilli doll (which was not a children's toy, but rather an adult gag gift) in a Swiss shop and brought it home. The Lilli doll was a representation of the same concept Ruth had been trying to sell to other Mattel executives. This doll was different than the baby-like dolls the girls would play with during this time, and Ruth was inspired.[3] Up until that point, there was a lack of dolls for girls who were old enough to comprehend the basic concepts of being a teenager and adulthood. Barbie aimed to directly fill that gap in the industry. \n Once home, she reworked the design of the doll and named her Barbie after the Handlers' daughter, Barbara.[5] Barbie debuted at the New York toy fair on March 9, 1959, but was not an immediate success. When Disney introduced The Mickey Mouse Club children's television show, Mattel invested heavily in television advertising. The TV commercials for the Barbie doll paid off and Barbie rocketed Mattel and the Handlers to fame and fortune. Subsequently, they would add a boyfriend for Barbie named Ken, after the Handlers' son, and many other \"friends and family\" to Barbie's world.\n Handler was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1970. She had a modified radical mastectomy, which was often used at the time to combat the disease, and because of difficulties in finding a good breast prosthesis, she decided to make her own. With Peyton Massey, Ruth founded, Ruthton Corp., which manufactured a more realistic version of a woman's breast, called \"Nearly Me\". She personally fitted one for the then first lady, Betty Ford.\n In 1974, Handler resigned from Mattel after investigations of producing fraudulent financial reports.[6] In 1978, Handler was charged with fraud and false reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission. She pleaded no contest, was fined $57,000 and sentenced to 2,500 hours of community service.[7] She blamed her illness for making her \"unfocused\" on her business.\n Though the Handlers took a more hands-off approach to their company's business practice after resigning, they continued to create new ideas. One project Handler took in the 1980s was Barbie and the Rockers. She was credited as a writer of the 1987 film Barbie and the Rockers: Out of this World. Handler was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1997. Barbie is still alive and prominent in today's youth as children around the US adore the set of dolls. Advertisements are still played by channels with a younger audience and the impact Barbie has had is immeasurable.\n She died in California from complications of surgery for colon cancer on April 27, 2002, aged 85.[8] Her husband Elliot died nine years later at the age of 95.\n ", "tags": ["1916 births", "2002 deaths", "20th-century American inventors", "American chief executives of manufacturing companies", "American inventors", "American people of Polish-Jewish descent", "American retail chief executives", "American toy industry businesspeople", "American women chief executives", "Barbie", "Breast cancer survivors", "Businesspeople from Denver", "Businesspeople from Los Angeles", "Jewish inventors", "Mattel people", "Toy inventors", "Women inventors", "Burials at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery", "Articles needing additional references from April 2021", "All articles needing additional references", "Marriage template deprecations", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.
