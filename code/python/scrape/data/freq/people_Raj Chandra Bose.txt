{"name": "Raj Chandra Bose", "content": "\n Raj Chandra Bose (19 June 1901 \u2013 31 October 1987) was an Indian American mathematician and statistician best known for his work in design theory, finite geometry and the theory of error-correcting codes in which the class of BCH codes is partly named after him. He also invented the notions of partial geometry, association scheme, and strongly regular graph and started a systematic study of difference sets to construct symmetric block designs. \nHe was notable for his work along with S. S. Shrikhande and E. T. Parker in their disproof of the famous conjecture made by Leonhard Euler dated 1782 that there do not exist two mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order 4n\u00a0+\u00a02 for every\u00a0n.\n Bose was born in Hoshangabad. When he was 2 months, his family moved to Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. His family moved to Amritsar, Punjab, India, in 1906 and to Calcutta in 1910. His father was a physician and life was good until 1918 when his mother died in the influenza pandemic. His father died of a stroke the following year. Despite difficult circumstances, Bose continued to study securing first class in both the Masters examinations in Pure and Applied mathematics in 1925 and 1927 respectively at the renowned Rajabazar Science College campus of University of Calcutta. His research was performed under the supervision of the geometry Professor Syamadas Mukhopadhyaya from Calcutta. Bose worked as a lecturer at Asutosh College, Calcutta. He published his work on the differential geometry of convex curves. He did college from 1920 to 1926\n Bose's course changed in December 1932 when P. C. Mahalanobis, director of the new (1931) Indian Statistical Institute, offered Bose a part-time job. Mahalanobis had seen Bose's geometrical work and wanted him to work on statistics. The day after Bose moved in, the secretary brought him all the volumes of Biometrika with a list of 50 papers to read and also Fisher's Statistical Methods for Research Workers. Mahalanobis told him, \"You were saying that you do not know much statistics. You master the 50 papers ... and Fisher's book. This will suffice for your statistical education for the present.\" With Samarendra Nath Roy, who joined the ISI a little later, Bose was the chief mathematician at the Institute.\n He first worked with multivariate analysis where he collaborated with Mahalanobis and Roy. In 1932, Ronald Fisher visited India and talked about the design of experiments. Roy had the idea of using the theory of finite fields and finite geometry to solve problems in design. The development of a mathematical theory of design would be Bose's main preoccupation until the mid-1950s. Especially, Fisher went to India to help Bose find his job.\n In 1930, Bose moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut and worked at the University of Bridgeport for 3 years.\n In 1933, Raj immigrated to Raleigh, North Carolina. He worked in Permanent Professorships in North Carolina State University in Raleigh. He lived there from 1933 to 1970.\n In 1935 Bose had become full-time at the Institute. In 1940 joined the University of Calcutta where C. R. Rao and H. K. Nandi were in the first group of students he taught. In 1945 Bose became Head of the Department of Statistics. Then he came back to USA. the university authorities told him he needed to have a doctorate. So he submitted his published papers on multivariate analysis and the design of experiments and was awarded a D. Litt. in 1947. \n In 1947 Bose went to the Chapel Hill as a visiting professor at Columbia University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He received offers from American universities and he was also offered positions in India. The Indian jobs involved very heavy administration, which he saw as the end of his research work and in March 1949 he joined the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as Professor of Statistics.\n In the years at Chapel Hill Bose made important discoveries on coding theory (with D.K. Ray-Chaudhuri) and constructed (with S. S. Shrikhande and E. T. Parker) a Graeco-Latin square of size 10, a counterexample to Euler's conjecture that no Graeco-Latin square of size 4k\u00a0+\u00a02 exists. In 1971, he retired at the age of 70. He then accepted a chair at Colorado State University of Fort Collins from which he retired in 1980. His final doctoral student finished after this second retirement.\n Bose died in Colorado, aged 86, in 1987.\n This has a chapter in which Bose tells the story of his life.\n ", "tags": ["1901 births", "1987 deaths", "Indian emigrants to the United States", "Indian statisticians", "Information theorists", "Bengali mathematicians", "Colorado State University faculty", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faculty", "Latin squares", "University of Calcutta alumni", "University of Calcutta faculty", "Presidents of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics", "People from Hoshangabad", "Fellows of the American Statistical Association", "Indian Statistical Institute faculty", "American academics of Indian descent", "20th-century Indian mathematicians", "Scientists from Kolkata", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "EngvarB from September 2014", "Use dmy dates from September 2014", "Articles needing additional references from June 2012", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
