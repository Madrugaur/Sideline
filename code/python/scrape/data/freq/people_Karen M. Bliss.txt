{"name": "Karen M. Bliss", "content": "Karen M. Bliss is an American applied mathematician currently at Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia who specializes in biomedical applications and materials science. She has co-authored many modeling handbooks, most notably, Math Modeling: Getting Started and Getting Solutions, for Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in 2014 which is used by teachers and students learning the basics along with those participating in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling.[1][2]\n For her undergraduate degree, Bliss attended the University of Missouri \u2013 Rolla (Missouri University of Science and Technology) from 1994 to 1998 and graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in applied mathematics. She attended North Carolina State University for her graduate studies, earning her Master of Science in applied mathematics in May 2000. From 2000 to 2004, Bliss served in the US Navy as a mathematics instructor for machinery operators. Under supervision of  Harvey Banks and Hien Tran, she earned her PhD in Applied Mathematics in 2011 from North Carolina State University, with her dissertation on modeling red blood cells in kidney disease patients.[3]\n After postdoctoral research at the National Academy of Sciences as a Davies Fellow and teaching at the United States Military Academy, Bliss became an associate professor of Mathematics at Quinnipiac University. There, she was a mentor for the mathematics club and a mentor for undergraduate research.[4] As of 2018, Bliss is an associate professor in the department of Applied Mathematics and VCUR Programs Coordinator at Virginia Military Institute.[5]\n With Kathleen Fowler and Benjamin J. Galluzzo, Bliss published Math Modeling: Getting Started and Getting Solutions for the MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge.[1] In 2018, Bliss published a more advanced handbook titled, Math Modeling: Computing and Communicating with Benjamin J.
