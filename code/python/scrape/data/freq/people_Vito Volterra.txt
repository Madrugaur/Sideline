{"name": "Vito Volterra", "content": "\n Professor Vito Volterra KBE FRS(For) HFRSE (/vo\u028al\u02c8t\u025br\u0259/, Italian:\u00a0[\u02c8vi\u02d0to vol\u02c8t\u025brra]; 3 May 1860 \u2013 11 October 1940) was an Italian mathematician and physicist, known for his contributions to mathematical biology and integral equations,[2][3] being one of the founders of functional analysis.[4]\n Born in Ancona, then part of the Papal States, into a very poor Jewish family: his father was Abramo Volterra and mother, Angelica Almagia.[5]\n Volterra showed early promise in mathematics before attending the University of Pisa, where he fell under the influence of Enrico Betti, and where he became professor of rational mechanics in 1883. He immediately started work developing his theory of functionals which led to his interest and later contributions in integral and integro-differential equations. His work is summarised in his book Theory of functionals and of Integral and Integro-Differential Equations (1930).\n In 1892, he became professor of mechanics at the University of Turin and then, in 1900, professor of mathematical physics at the University of Rome La Sapienza. Volterra had grown up during the final stages of the Risorgimento when the Papal States were finally annexed by Italy and, like his mentor Betti, he was an enthusiastic patriot, being named by the king Victor Emmanuel III as a senator of the Kingdom of Italy in 1905. In the same year, he began to develop the theory of dislocations in crystals that was later to become important in the understanding of the behaviour of ductile materials. On the outbreak of World War I, already well into his 50s, he joined the Italian Army and worked on the development of airships under Giulio Douhet. He originated the idea of using inert helium rather than flammable hydrogen and made use of his leadership abilities in organising its manufacture.\n After World War I, Volterra turned his attention to the application of his mathematical ideas to biology, principally reiterating and developing the work of Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Verhulst. An outcome of this period is the Lotka\u2013Volterra equations.\n Volterra is the only person who was a plenary speaker in the International Congress of Mathematicians four times (1900, 1908, 1920, 1928).[6][7][8][9][10]\n In 1922, he joined the opposition to the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini and in 1931 he was one of only 12 out of 1,250 professors who refused to take a mandatory oath of loyalty. His political philosophy can be seen from a postcard he sent in the 1930s, on which he wrote what can be seen as an epitaph for Mussolini's Italy: Empires die, but Euclid\u2019s theorems keep their youth forever. However, Volterra was no radical firebrand; he might have been equally appalled if the leftist opposition to Mussolini had come to power, since he was a lifelong royalist and nationalist. As a result of his refusal to sign the oath of allegiance to the fascist government he was compelled to resign his university post and his membership of scientific academies, and, during the following years, he lived largely abroad, returning to Rome just before his death.\n In 1936, he had been appointed a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, on the initiative of founder Agostino Gemelli.\n He died in Rome on 11 October 1940. He is buried in the Ariccia Cemetery. The Academy organised his funeral.\n In 1900 he married Virginia Almagia, a cousin.[11] Their son Edoardo Volterra (1904\u20131984) was a famous historian of Roman law.[12]\n Volterra also had a daughter, Luisa Volterra, who married Umberto d'Ancona. D'Ancona piqued his father-in-law's interest in biomathematics when he showed Vito a set of data regarding populations of different species of fish on the Adriatic Sea, where decreased fishing activity from the war had led to an increase in the populations of predatory fish species. Vito published an analysis of the dynamics of interacting species of fish the next year.\n ", "tags": ["1860 births", "1940 deaths", "People from Ancona", "20th-century Italian Jews", "Jewish physicists", "Italian physicists", "Mathematical analysts", "Mathematical physicists", "Functional analysts", "Mathematical and theoretical biology", "University of Pisa alumni", "Sapienza University of Rome faculty", "Members of the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy", "19th-century Italian mathematicians", "20th-century Italian mathematicians", "Members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences", "Corresponding Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1917\u20131925)", "Corresponding Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Honorary Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "University of Turin faculty", "20th-century Italian politicians", "University of Pisa faculty", "19th-century Italian Jews", "CS1: long volume value", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from July 2018", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 Italian-language sources (it)", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Italian mathematician\n\n\nVito VolterraVito VolterraBorn(1860-05-03)3 May 1860Ancona, Papal StatesDied11 October 1940(1940-10-11) (aged\u00a080)Rome, Kingdom of ItalyNationalityItalianAlma\u00a0materUniversity of PisaKnown\u00a0forTheory of integral equations The Lotka\u2013Volterra equationsAwardsForMemRS[1]Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of TurinDoctoral advisorEnrico BettiDoctoral studentsPaul L\u00e9vyJoseph P\u00e9r\u00e8s\n\nProfessor Vito Volterra KBE FRS(For) HFRSE (/vo\u028al\u02c8t\u025br\u0259/, Italian:\u00a0[\u02c8vi\u02d0to vol\u02c8t\u025brra]; 3 May 1860 \u2013 11 October 1940) was an Italian mathematician and physicist, known for his contributions to mathematical biology and integral equations,[2][3] being one of the founders of functional analysis.[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Family\n3 Selected writings by Volterra\n4 See also\n5 Notes\n6 Biographical references\n7 General references\n8 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nBorn in Ancona, then part of the Papal States, into a very poor Jewish family: his father was Abramo Volterra and mother, Angelica Almagia.[5]\nVolterra showed early promise in mathematics before attending the University of Pisa, where he fell under the influence of Enrico Betti, and where he became professor of rational mechanics in 1883.
