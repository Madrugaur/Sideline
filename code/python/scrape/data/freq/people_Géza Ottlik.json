{"name": "G\u00e9za Ottlik", "content": "\n G\u00e9za Ottlik (9 May 1912 \u2013 9 October 1990) was a Hungarian writer, translator, mathematician, and bridge theorist. According to an American obituary bridge column, he was known in Hungary as \"the ultimate authority on Hungarian prose\".[1]\n Ottlik was born and died in Budapest. He attended the military school at K\u0151szeg and Budapest, and studied mathematics and physics at Budapest University 1931\u20131935. After a brief career on Hungarian radio, he was a secretary of Hungarian PEN Club from 1945 to 1957. As he was unable to publish his works for political reasons, he earned his living translating. He translated mainly from English (Charles Dickens, George Bernard Shaw, John Osborne, Evelyn Waugh); and German (Thomas Mann, G. Keller, Stefan Zweig).\n He was a passionate bridge player and advanced theoretician. In a bridge column three months after Ottlik's death, Alan Truscott placed him \"among the strongest candidates\" for \"the bridge writer with the greatest creativity in terms of card-play theory\".[1] His 1979 book Adventures in Card Play, written with Hugh Kelsey, introduced and developed many new concepts[2] (such as Backwash squeeze and Entry-shifting squeeze). According to Truscott it \"opened new frontiers\" in defence as well as declarer play.[1] In his 1995 obituary of Kelsey, Truscott wrote that it \"broke new ground in many technical areas and is still considered the most advanced book on the play of the cards.\"[3] An American survey of bridge experts in 2007 ranked it third on a list of their all-time favourites, nearly thirty years after its first publication.[4]\n From October 1944 to February 1945, Ottlik and his wife Gy\u00f6ngyi Debreczeni hid the writer Istv\u00e1n Vas\u00a0[hu], a Jew, in their apartment and shared their food rations with him. G\u00e9za personally intervened to obtain the release of Vas' mother from arrest; if he had not done so, she would have been sent on a death march towards Germany. Gy\u00f6ngyi faced down a group of Arrow Cross Party members who had broken into the apartment to search for the Jew allegedly hiding there; they left without discovering Vas, who survived World War II. For this, the couple were honoured on 4 June 1998 by Yad Vashem as people Righteous Among the Nations.[5]\n ", "tags": ["Hungarian writers", "Hungarian contract bridge players", "Contract bridge writers", "Writers from Budapest", "Hungarian noble families", "1912 births", "1990 deaths", "Burials at Farkasr\u00e9ti Cemetery", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "Hungarian Righteous Among the Nations", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Use dmy dates from May 2015", "Use British English from July 2015", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThe native form of this personal name is Ottlik G\u00e9za.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\n G\u00e9za Ottlik\nG\u00e9za Ottlik (9 May 1912 \u2013 9 October 1990) was a Hungarian writer, translator, mathematician, and bridge theorist.
