{"name": "Robert Zubrin", "content": "\n Robert Zubrin (/\u02c8zu\u02d0br\u026an/;[1] born April 9,[2] 1952[3]) is an American aerospace engineer, author, and advocate for human exploration of Mars. He and his colleague at Martin Marietta, David Baker, were the driving force behind Mars Direct, a proposal in a 1990 research paper intended to produce significant reductions in the cost and complexity of such a mission. The key idea was to use the Martian atmosphere to produce oxygen, water, and rocket propellant for the surface stay and return journey.  A modified version of the plan was subsequently adopted by NASA as their \"design reference mission\". He questions the delay and cost-to-benefit ratio of first establishing a base or outpost on an asteroid or another Apollo program-like return to the Moon, as neither would be able to provide all of its own oxygen, water, or energy; these resources are producible on Mars, and he expects people would be there thereafter.[4]\n Disappointed with the lack of interest from government in Mars exploration and after the success of his book The Case for Mars (1996), as well as leadership experience at the National Space Society, Zubrin established the Mars Society in 1998. This is an international organization advocating a human mission to Mars as a goal, by private funding if possible.\n Zubrin was born in New York City's Brooklyn borough[3] on April 9, 1952. His parents were descended from Russian Jewish immigrants.[5] He was a science teacher for 7 years before becoming an engineer.[3]\n Zubrin holds a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Rochester (1974), a M.S. in Nuclear Engineering (1984), a M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics (1986), and a Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering (1992) \u2014 all from the University of Washington.[6][circular reference][7] He has developed a number of concepts for space propulsion and exploration, and is the author of over 200 technical and non-technical papers and several books. He was a member of Lockheed Martin's scenario development team charged with developing strategies for space exploration. He was also \"a senior engineer with the Martin Marietta Astronautics company, working as one of its leaders in development of advanced concepts for interplanetary missions\".[8] He is also President of both the Mars Society and Pioneer Astronautics, a private company that does research and development on innovative aerospace technologies. Zubrin is the co-inventor on a U.S. design patent and a U.S. utility patent on a hybrid rocket/airplane, and on a U.S. utility patent on an oxygen supply system (see links below). He was awarded his first patent at age 20 in 1972 for Three Player Chess. His inventions also include the nuclear salt-water rocket and co-inventor (with Dana Andrews) of the magnetic sail. Zubrin is fellow at Center for Security Policy.[9]\n In 2008, Zubrin founded Pioneer Energy, a research and development firm headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado. The company's focus is to develop mobile Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) systems that can enable CO2-based EOR for both small and large oil producers in the United States. The company has also developed a number of new processes for manufacturing synthetic fuels.[10]\n Zubrin has also edited or co-edited the following books, most of which include his contributions:\n Dr. Zubrin is known as an advocate of a moderately anthropocentric position in the ethics of terraforming. Discussions of the ethics of terraforming often[citation needed] make reference to a series of public debates Zubrin has held with his friend Christopher McKay, who advocates a moderately biocentric position on the ethics of terraforming. For example, a written account of some of these debates is available in On to Mars: Colonizing a New World, as a joint article, \"Do Indigenous Martian Bacteria have Precedence over Human Exploration?\" (pp.\u00a0177\u2013182)\n An aging Robert Zubrin also appears as a background character in The Martian Race (1999) by Gregory Benford, a science fiction novel depicting early human explorers on Mars in the very near future. Benford, who is also an astrophysicist, is a longtime member of both the board of directors and the steering committee of the Mars Society.\n Robert Zubrin was also featured in a 2007 CBC Television documentary special, The Passionate Eye, dubbed \"The Mars Underground\".[13]\n The songwriter and musician Frank Black (alias Black Francis of the Pixies) penned an homage to Zubrin, \"Robert Onion\", on the album Dog in the Sand. The lyrics are in the form of an acrostic, spelling \"Robert The Case For Mars Zubrin\".[14]\n In 2010 Robert Zubrin was featured in the Symphony of Science video \"The Case for Mars\" along with Carl Sagan, Brian Cox, and Penelope Boston.\n The fictional character Dr. Zachary Walzer in the 2010\u20132011 independent VODO series Pioneer One was inspired by Zubrin.[15]\n In 2016, Zubrin was one of several scientists and engineers interviewed in the National Geographic miniseries Mars.\n ", "tags": ["American aerospace engineers", "Space advocates", "Mars Society", "21st-century American novelists", "American male novelists", "American people of Russian-Jewish descent", "American science writers", "American science fiction writers", "American satirists", "Jewish American writers", "University of Washington College of Engineering alumni", "1952 births", "Living people", "American nuclear engineers", "Exploration of Mars", "Mars One", "Lockheed Martin people", "21st-century American male writers", "21st-century American non-fiction writers", "American male non-fiction writers", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from July 2011", "Articles with hCards", "All articles lacking reliable references", "Articles lacking reliable references from October 2019", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from December 2013", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American aerospace engineer\n\n\nRobert ZubrinPhoto of Zubrin by the Mars SocietyBorn (1952-04-09) April 9, 1952 (age\u00a068)New York City, New York, U.S.NationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Rochester(B.A)University of Washington(M.S), (PhD)Known\u00a0forMars DirectMars SocietyThe Case for MarsEnergy VictorySpouse(s)Hope ZubrinScientific careerFieldsAerospace engineeringInstitutionsMartin MariettaPioneer Astronautics\n\nRobert Zubrin (/\u02c8zu\u02d0br\u026an/;[1] born April 9,[2] 1952[3]) is an American aerospace engineer, author, and advocate for human exploration of Mars.

The company has also developed a number of new processes for manufacturing synthetic fuels.[10]\n\nBooks[edit]\nThe Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must (1996), with Richard Wagner. This outlines the Mars Direct plan along with speculation about the economic, social and technical viability of future Mars colonization. Revised and updated in 2011.\nEntering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization (1999). This describes humanity's spacefaring potential as a Type I, II & III civilization. With Type I Zubrin describes humanity as a \"Completed Global Civilization\", along with the status quo and innovative startups of the aerospace industry. Type II details humanity as a \"Spacefaring Civilization\" through exploration and colonization of the moon, Mars, and the solar system , along with urgency for why man needs to take these bold steps. Type III is a Galactic Civilization through a long-term futuristic look at humanity's feasibility of interstellar travel with known physics.\nMars On Earth: The Adventures of Space Pioneers in the High Arctic (2003). Zubrin recounts the origins and progress of the Mars Society's Mars Analog Research Station project, including a variety of perils, both mundane and adventurous, that were overcome in establishing the first analog Mars habitat on Devon Island in the high Arctic. He offers highlights of what has been learned so far through that effort.\nFirst Landing (2001), a hard science fiction novel about a future Mars flight using the Mars Direct plan.\nThe Holy Land (2003). This is an \"SF satire on the Middle East crisis and the War on Terrorism, and concerns what happens when the liberal Western Galactic Empire relocates the oppressed Minervan sect to their ancient homeland of Kennewick, Washington, in the midst of a United States ruled by Christian fundamentalist fanatics\".[11] The story was partly inspired by \u010capek's War with the Newts.[12]\nBenedict Arnold: A Drama of the American Revolution in Five Acts (2005). This is an effort to humanize and show the multiple dimensions of Benedict Arnold, and to contrast the democratic values embodied in the spirit of the Revolution with the socially bankrupt classism embodied in the British subjects who won Arnold to their side.\nEnergy Victory: Winning the War on Terror by Breaking Free of Oil (2007). An expansion on his recent articles criticizing both reliance on oil and the potential for hydrogen energy, while highlighting the benefits of switching more toward methanol and ethanol.

This traces the history of antihumanism over the last two centuries, from Thomas Malthus and the eugenics movement through to the anti-nuclear and global warming campaigns. Zubrin argues that these movements have all represented an attempt to gain oppressive political control through the restriction of human activities and freedom.\nMars Direct: Space Exploration, the Red Planet, and the Human Future (2013). This e-book looks at the current situation of NASA and outlines a Mars Direct mission proposal with the SpaceX Dragon, and considers the implications of interplanetary exploration for humanity.\nThe Case for Space: How the Revolution in Spaceflight Opens Up a Future of Limitless Possibility Prometheus Books (2019)\nBooks edited or co-authored[edit]\nZubrin has also edited or co-edited the following books, most of which include his contributions:\n\nMars Direct: A Simple, Robust, and Cost Effective Architecture for the Space Exploration Initiative (1991), co-edited by D.A.V.I.D. Baker and Owen Gwyne.
