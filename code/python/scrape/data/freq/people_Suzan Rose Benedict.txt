{"name": "Suzan Rose Benedict", "content": "Suzan Rose Benedict (November 29, 1873 \u2013 April 8, 1942) was the first woman awarded a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Michigan and had a long teaching career at Smith College.[1]\n Suzan Benedict was born in Norwalk, Ohio, the youngest of seven children of David DeForrest Benedict, MD and Harriott Melvina Benedict (n\u00e9e Deaver). Dr. Benedict had been a Union Surgeon in the American Civil War.[2] She was a niece of oil magnate and philanthropist, Louis Severance.[3]\n After graduating high school in Norwalk, Suzan Benedict entered Smith College in 1891. She graduated in 1895 with a major in Chemistry and minors in Mathematics, German, and Physics, then returned to Norwalk and taught Mathematics until 1905, when she began graduate studies at Teacher's College, Columbia University. She received a M.A. in Mathematics from Columbia in 1906. That same year she joined the Mathematics Department at Smith College as an assistant in Mathematics and rose to become an instructor the following year.\n The summers of 1911 through 1913 she resumed her graduate studies at the University of Michigan and in 1913\u201314 she took a leave of absence from Smith to finish her dissertation directed by Louis Charles Karpinski: \u201cA Comparative Study of the Early Treatises Introducing into Europe the Hindu Art of Reckoning.\u201d She received her PhD in 1914.\n Suzan returned to Smith as an associate professor after receiving her PhD. She was promoted to professor in 1921. From 1918 to 1928 she was Dean of Students and she served as chairman of the Mathematics department from 1928 to 1934.\n Her first love was teaching. In May 1940 she wrote to Helen Owens, an instructor in mathematics at Pennsylvania State College: \"it was not modesty that prevented my sending you a long list of published papers, but a scarcity of such papers. I have lost track of the very few I have written, as I have been much more interested in teaching and administration than in research.\"[4]\n In February 1942 she retired as professor emeritus, intending to support the war effort by volunteering with the Red Cross.[2] Two months later, she was stricken with a heart attack and died.[5]\n Suzan Benedict never married. From 1918 she shared a home with Susan Miller Rambo, a colleague in the Mathematics Department at Smith College and the second woman to receive a PhD from the University of Michigan.[6]\n The Suzan R. Benedict Prize was established after her death by the college president and others at Smith College to be awarded to sophomores who had done exceptional work in differential and integral calculus.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1873 births", "1942 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "American women academics", "Smith College faculty", "American women mathematicians", "University of Michigan alumni", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nSuzan Rose BenedictBorn(1873-11-29)November 29, 1873Norwalk, OHDiedApril 8, 1942(1942-04-08) (aged\u00a068)Northampton, MassachusettsNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materSmith CollegeColumbia UniversityUniversity of MichiganScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsSmith CollegeThesisA Comparative Study of the Early Treatises Introducing into Europe the Hindu Art of Reckoning\u00a0(1914)Doctoral advisorLouis Charles Karpinski\n\nSuzan Rose Benedict (November 29, 1873 \u2013 April 8, 1942) was the first woman awarded a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Michigan and had a long teaching career at Smith College.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career at Smith College\n3 Memberships\n4 Publications\n5 Legacy\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nSuzan Benedict was born in Norwalk, Ohio, the youngest of seven children of David DeForrest Benedict, MD and Harriott Melvina Benedict (n\u00e9e Deaver).
