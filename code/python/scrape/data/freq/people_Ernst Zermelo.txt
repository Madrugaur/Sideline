{"name": "Ernst Zermelo", "content": "\n Ernst Friedrich Ferdinand Zermelo (/z\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8m\u025blo\u028a/, German: [ts\u025b\u0250\u032f\u02c8me\u02d0lo]; 27 July 1871\u00a0\u2013 21 May 1953) was a German logician and mathematician, whose work has major implications for the foundations of mathematics. He is known for his role in developing Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axiomatic set theory and his proof of the well-ordering theorem.\n Ernst Zermelo graduated from Berlin's Luisenst\u00e4dtisches Gymnasium (now Heinrich-Schliemann-Oberschule\u00a0[de]) in 1889. He then studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the University of Berlin, the University of Halle, and the University of Freiburg. He finished his doctorate in 1894 at the University of Berlin, awarded for a dissertation on the calculus of variations (Untersuchungen zur Variationsrechnung). Zermelo remained at the University of Berlin, where he was appointed assistant to Planck, under whose guidance he began to study hydrodynamics. In 1897, Zermelo went to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, at that time the leading centre for mathematical research in the world, where he completed his habilitation thesis in 1899.\n In 1910, Zermelo left G\u00f6ttingen upon being appointed to the chair of mathematics at Zurich University, which he resigned in 1916.\nHe was appointed to an honorary chair at the University of Freiburg in 1926, which he resigned in 1935 because he disapproved of Adolf Hitler's regime. At the end of World War II and at his request, Zermelo was reinstated to his honorary position in Freiburg.\n In 1900, in the Paris conference of the International Congress of Mathematicians, David Hilbert challenged the mathematical community with his famous Hilbert's problems, a list of 23 unsolved fundamental questions which mathematicians should attack during the coming century. The first of these, a problem of set theory, was the continuum hypothesis introduced by Cantor in 1878, and in the course of its statement Hilbert mentioned also the need to prove the well-ordering theorem.\n Zermelo began to work on the problems of set theory under Hilbert's influence and in 1902 published his first work concerning the addition of transfinite cardinals. By that time he had also discovered the so-called Russell paradox. In 1904, he succeeded in taking the first step suggested by Hilbert towards the continuum hypothesis when he proved the well-ordering theorem (every set can be well ordered). This result brought fame to Zermelo, who was appointed Professor in G\u00f6ttingen, in 1905. His proof of the well-ordering theorem, based on the powerset axiom and the axiom of choice, was not accepted by all mathematicians, mostly because the axiom of choice was a paradigm of non-constructive mathematics. In 1908, Zermelo succeeded in producing an improved proof making use of Dedekind's notion of the \"chain\" of a set, which became more widely accepted; this was mainly because that same year he also offered an axiomatization of set theory.\n Zermelo began to axiomatize set theory in 1905; in 1908, he published his results despite his failure to prove the consistency of his axiomatic system. See the article on Zermelo set theory for an outline of this paper, together with the original axioms, with the original numbering.\n In 1922, Abraham Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem independently improved Zermelo's axiom system. The resulting 8 axiom system, now called Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms (ZF), is now the most commonly used system for axiomatic set theory.\n Proposed in 1931, the Zermelo's navigation problem is a classic optimal control problem. The problem deals with a boat navigating on a body of water, originating from a point O to a destination point D. The boat is capable of a certain maximum speed, and we want to derive the best possible control to reach D in the least possible time.\n Without considering external forces such as current and wind, the optimal control is for the boat to always head towards D. Its path then is a line segment from O to D, which is trivially optimal. With consideration of current and wind, if the combined force applied to the boat is non-zero the control for no current and wind does not yield the optimal path.\n Works by others:\n ", "tags": ["1871 births", "1953 deaths", "20th-century German philosophers", "19th-century German mathematicians", "Mathematical logicians", "Writers from Berlin", "People from the Province of Brandenburg", "Set theorists", "People associated with the University of Zurich", "Humboldt University of Berlin alumni", "Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg alumni", "University of Freiburg alumni", "University of Freiburg faculty", "University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty", "German male writers", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Use dmy dates from June 2015", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nErnst ZermeloErnst Zermelo in the 1900sBorn(1871-07-27)27 July 1871Berlin, German EmpireDied21 May 1953(1953-05-21) (aged\u00a081)Freiburg im Breisgau, West GermanyNationalityGermanyAlma\u00a0materUniversity of BerlinKnown\u00a0for\nZermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory\nZermelo's navigation problem\nWell-ordering theorem\nZermelo's theorem (game theory)\nZermelo ordinal\nSpouse(s)Gertrud Seekamp (1944 - death)AwardsAckermann\u2013Teubner Memorial Award (1916)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of Z\u00fcrichDoctoral advisor\nLazarus Fuchs\nHermann Schwarz\nDoctoral studentsStefan Straszewicz\u00a0[pl]\n\nErnst Friedrich Ferdinand Zermelo (/z\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8m\u025blo\u028a/, German: [ts\u025b\u0250\u032f\u02c8me\u02d0lo]; 27 July 1871\u00a0\u2013 21 May 1953) was a German logician and mathematician, whose work has major implications for the foundations of mathematics.
