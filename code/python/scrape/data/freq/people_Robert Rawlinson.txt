{"name": "Robert Rawlinson", "content": "\n Sir Robert Rawlinson KCB (28 February 1810 \u2013 31 May 1898) was an English engineer and sanitarian.\n He was born at Bristol.  His father was a mason and builder at Chorley, Lancashire,[1] and he himself began his engineering education by working in a stonemason's yard.[1]\n In 1831, he obtained employment under Jesse Hartley in the engineers office at the Liverpool docks, and for four years from 1836 he was engaged under Robert Stephenson as assistant resident engineer for the Blisworth section of what is now the London & North-Western main line from London to the North.\n Returning to Liverpool, he spent some years as assistant-surveyor to the corporation, and then in 1844 accepted an engineering post on the Bridgewater Canal. Three years later he returned to Liverpool, to superintend the design and construction of the famous brick-arched ceiling in the St George's Hall, in succession to, his friend H. L. Elmes. During this period Rawlinson's reputation as a sanitarian had been growing. In 1847 he devised a scheme to supply from Bala Lake in Gwynedd, Wales to Liverpool.[1] When the Public Health Act was passed in 1848 he was appointed one of the first inspectors under it.[1] He inspected many of the chief towns of England, and his reports on the sanitary conditions he found brought him in many cases into great unpopularity with the municipal rulers.\n Early in 1855 popular feeling was so aroused by the waste of life that was going on among the British troops in the Crimea through disease, and by the mismanagement of the campaign, that the Aberdeen ministry was forced to resign. Lord Palmerston, who then became prime minister, sent a sanitary commission, consisting of Rawlinson and two medical members (Dr. John Sutherland and Dr. Hector Gavin), with full powers from the War Office, to do whatever it thought would lead to better hygienic conditions in camp and hospital.[1] The commission reached Constantinople in March, and, by insisting on what now seem the most obvious precautions, succeeded within a few weeks in reducing the death-rate in the Levantine hospitals from 42 to 2\u00bc%. Passing on to the Crimea, it effected a similar improvement there, and by the end of the year the health of the whole British army in the field was even better than it enjoyed at home.\n Rawlinson's next great public service, for which he was made C.B. in 1865, was in connection with the distress caused in Lancashire by the collapse of the cotton manufacturing industry consequent on the American Civil War.[1] In 1863 it was suggested that, to provide employment for the starving operatives, the government should start works of utility, profit and ornament, and Rawlinson being sent to make an official investigation into the question, reported, after visiting nearly 100 towns, that 1/2 million sterling might be advantageously expended in providing water-supply and drainage, forming streets, etc., in those places. The result was that the Treasury was authorised to advance 1,200,000 the amount was afterwards increased) for carrying out such works, which proved of enormous public benefit.\n In 1866 he acted as chairman of the Royal Commission on the Pollution of Rivers, and a few years later was appointed chief engineering inspector to the Local Government Board; on retiring from this position in 1888 be was promoted to be KCB.[1]\n Between May 1894 and May 1895 he served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers.[2]\n Rawlinson died in London on 31 May 1898 and is buried there in Brompton Cemetery on the side of the main entrance path from the north gate.[1]\n He had married, in 1831, Ruth Swallow, daughter of Thomas Swallow, of Lockwood, Huddersfield. Lady Rawlinson died at her residence in West Brompton on 18 August 1902, aged 91.[3]\n Rawlinson amassed a sizebale art collection, including 5 paintings by Richard Ansdell and 3 paintings and 5 watercolours by Richard Dadd, which were sold in 1903, after his wife\u00b4s death.[4]\n \n ", "tags": ["1810 births", "1898 deaths", "People from Bristol", "English engineers", "Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath", "Burials at Brompton Cemetery", "Presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers", "Presidents of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "EngvarB from October 2013", "Use dmy dates from October 2013", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nRobert RawlinsonRobert Rawlinson in Crimea, 1855Born28 February 1810Bristol, EnglandDied31 May 1898(1898-05-31) (aged\u00a088)London, EnglandNationalityEnglishOccupationEngineerEngineering careerDisciplineCivil,InstitutionsInstitution of Civil Engineers (president),\n\nSir Robert Rawlinson KCB (28 February 1810 \u2013 31 May 1898) was an English engineer and sanitarian.\n\n Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Family and personal life\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nHe was born at Bristol.
