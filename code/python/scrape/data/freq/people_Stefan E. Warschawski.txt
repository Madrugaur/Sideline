After receiving his Ph.D., Warschawski took a position at G\u00f6ttingen in 1930 but, due to the rise of Hitler and his own Jewish ancestry, he soon moved to Utrecht University in Utrecht, Netherlands and then Columbia University in New York City.[1] After a sequence of temporary positions, he found a permanent faculty position at Washington University in St. Louis in 1939.[1][3] During World War II he moved to Brown University and then the University of Minnesota, where he remained until his 1963 move to San Diego, where he was the founding chair of the mathematics department.[1][3][4][6][7] Warschawski stepped down as chair in 1967,[8] and retired in 1971, but remained active in research: approximately one third of his research publications were written after his retirement.[3] Over the course of his career, he advised 19 Ph.D. students, all but one at either Minnesota or San Diego.[3][5] Vernor Vinge is among Warschawski's doctoral students.[5]\n He was known for his research on complex analysis and in particular on conformal maps. He also made contributions to the theory of minimal surfaces and harmonic functions.[1][3] The Noshiro\u2013Warschawski theorem is named after Warschawski and Noshiro, who discovered it independently;[9][10][11][12] it states that, if \u0192 is an analytic function on the open unit disk such that the real part of its first derivative is positive, then \u0192 is one-to-one.  In 1980 he solved the Visser\u2013Ostrowski problem for derivatives of conformal mappings at the boundary.[13]\n Warschawski was honored in 1978 by the creation of the Stefan E. Warschawski Assistant Professorship at San Diego.[3] The Stephen E. Warschawski Memorial Scholarship was also given in his name in 1999\u20132000 to four UCSD undergraduates as a one-time award.[7] His wife, Ilse, died in 2009 and left a US$1 million bequest to UCSD, part of which went towards endowing a professorship in the mathematics department.[8]\n ", "tags": ["1904 births", "1989 deaths", "People from Lida", "People from Lidsky Uyezd", "Mathematical analysts", "20th-century American mathematicians", "University of K\u00f6nigsberg alumni", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "University of Basel alumni", "University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty", "Utrecht University faculty", "Columbia University faculty", "Washington University in St. Louis faculty", "Washington University in St. Louis mathematicians", "Brown University faculty", "University of Minnesota faculty", "University of California, San Diego faculty", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Stefan WarschawskiBorn(1904-04-18)18 April 1904Lida, Russian EmpireDied5 May 1989(1989-05-05) (aged\u00a085)Alma\u00a0materUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenUniversity of K\u00f6nigsbergScientific careerInstitutionsUniversity of California, San DiegoWashington University in St. LouisBrown UniversityUniversity of MinnesotaDoctoral advisorAlexander OstrowskiDoctoral studentsVernor Vinge\n\nStefan Emanuel \"Steve\" Warschawski (April 18, 1904 \u2013 May 5, 1989) was a mathematician, a professor and department chair at the University of Minnesota and the founder of the mathematics department at the University of California, San Diego.\nWarschawski was born in Lida, now in Belarus; at the time of his birth Lida was part of the Russian Empire.[1][2][3][4] His father was a Russian medical doctor, and his mother was ethnically German;[4] the family spoke German at home.[3] In 1915, his family moved to K\u00f6nigsberg, in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia), the home of his mother's family; Warschawski studied at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg until 1926 and then moved to the University of G\u00f6ttingen for his doctoral studies under the supervision of Alexander Ostrowski.[1][2][3][5] Ostrowski soon moved to the University of Basel and Warschawski followed him there to complete his studies.
