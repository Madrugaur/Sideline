In 1994, she was awarded the John J. Carty Award from the National Academy of Sciences.[5]\n Ratner was born in Moscow, Russian SFSR to a Jewish family, where her father was a plant physiologist and her mother a chemist. Ratner's mother was fired from work in the 1940s for writing to her mother in Israel, then considered an enemy of the Soviet state. Ratner gained an interest in mathematics in her fifth grade. From 1956 to 1961, she studied mathematics and physics at  Moscow State University. Here, she became interested in probability theory,  inspired by A.N. Kolmogorov and his group.[6] After graduation, she spent four years working in Kolmogorov's applied statistics group. Following this, she returned to Moscow State university for graduate studies were under Yakov G. Sinai, also a student of Kolmogorov.
