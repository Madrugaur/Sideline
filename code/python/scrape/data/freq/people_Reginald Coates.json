He was taken into articled pupilage, a form of apprenticeship, by Mansfield Borough Council and studied for a degree in Civil Engineering at University College Nottingham.[1]\n He served as an officer in the Royal Engineers during the Second World War, being commissioned as a second lieutenant on 16 August 1942,[2] and was posted to North Africa, Sicily, Italy and Austria. In 1946 he took up a lecturing post at his alma mater, now the University of Nottingham, using the university\u2019s facilities to undertake research for his doctorate. He retained his commission and was involved in the University Officers Training Corps detachment.[3] In 1958 he was appointed as the head of the School of Civil Engineering, taking over from Sir Joseph Pope.[1]\n When the Faculty of Engineering moved to new premises in the 1960s Coates was heavily involved in the planning of the new buildings. Under his leadership the school became recognized as one of the leading civil engineering research establishments in the country.
