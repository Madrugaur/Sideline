{"name": "Ildefons Cerd\u00e0", "content": "\n Ildefons Cerd\u00e0 i Sunyer[1] (Catalan pronunciation:\u00a0[ild\u0259\u02c8fons s\u0259\u027e\u02c8\u00f0a i su\u02c8\u0272e]; Centelles, December 23, 1815 \u2013 Caldas de Besaya, August 21, 1876) was the progressive Catalan Spanish urban planner who designed the 19th-century \"extension\" of Barcelona called the Eixample. Because of his extensive theoretical and practical work, he is considered the founder of modern town planning as a discipline, having coined the new word \u201curbanization\u201d.[2] [3]\n Cerd\u00e0 was born in Centelles, Catalonia, Spain, in 1815.[4] He trained as a civil engineer at the Escuela de Ingenieros de Caminos, Canales y Puertos, in Madrid. He joined the Corps of Engineers and lived in various cities in Spain before settling in Barcelona in 1848 and marrying Clotilde Bosch.  After the death of his brothers, Cerd\u00e0 inherited the family fortune, and left the civil service. He became interested in politics and the study of urban planning.\n When the government of the time finally gave in to public pressure and allowed Barcelona's city walls to be torn down, he realized the need to plan the city's expansion so that the new extension would become an efficient and livable place, unlike the congested, epidemic-prone old town within the walls. When he failed to find suitable reference works, he undertook the task of writing one from scratch while designing what he called the Ensanche or Eixample, borrowing a few technological ideas from his contemporaries to create a unique, thoroughly modern integrated concept that was carefully considered rather than whimsically designed.\n He continued to create projects and improve existing designs throughout his lifetime, as well as to develop his theories taking on larger planning scopes (at the regional planning level), until the very end. In the process, he lost all his family's inheritance and he died in 1876 a heavily indebted near-pauper, never having been paid for his chief masterpiece, the design of Barcelona's Eixample.\n Cerd\u00e0 was a multi-faceted man who, in pursuit of his vision, gave up a steady job in the civil engineering service, stood for election and became a member of the Cortes (the Spanish Parliament); drafted useful ground-breaking legislation, drew up a detailed topographical survey map of Barcelona's surroundings, and wrote a theoretical treatise to support each of his major planning projects. He actually coined a number of important words in Spanish, including urbanizaci\u00f3n.\n Cerd\u00e0 focused on key needs: chiefly, the need for sunlight, natural lighting and ventilation in homes (he was heavily influenced by the sanitarian movement), the need for greenery in people's surroundings, the need for effective waste disposal including good sewerage, and the need for seamless movement of people, goods, energy, and information.\n His designs belie a network-oriented approach far ahead of his time. His street layout and grid plan were optimized to accommodate pedestrians, carriages, horse-drawn trams, urban railway lines (as yet unheard-of), gas supply and large-capacity sewers to prevent frequent floods, without neglecting public and private gardens and other key amenities. The latest technical innovations were incorporated in his designs if they could further the cause of better integration, but he also came up with remarkable new concepts of his own, including a logical system of land readjustment that was essential to the success of his project, and produced a thorough statistical analysis of working-class conditions at the time, which he undertook in order to demonstrate the ills of congestion.\n His plan for Barcelona underwent two major revisions; the second version, approved by the Spanish government at the time, is the one still recognizable in the layout of today's Eixample, though the low height of buildings and the gardens within every city block were soon dispensed with by politicians inclined to cave in to (or perhaps even indulge in) property speculation. In addition, only one of the two planned diagonal streets was realized. Culturally, the Eixample was (and still is) inhabited by the well-to-do, instead of integrating social classes.\nMany of the Catalan architects of his time opposed Cerd\u00e0's ideas, even accusing him of promoting socialism; in the end, however, they designed the Modernista fa\u00e7ades that brought fame to the district.\n Political developments in Spain and Catalonia eventually led to the enshrinement of a revisionist version of how Cerd\u00e0 secured official approval of his plan. Cerd\u00e0 actually drew up his plan under the commission of the then competent authority, the Spanish central government, with the support of the city council. A political reversal led to a change in local government, and the new council sought to preempt the previous central government's decision by holding a project competition in 1859, which Cerd\u00e0 lost; nevertheless, Cerd\u00e0's design prevailed, much to the chagrin of the major property owners.[citation needed]\n \n ", "tags": ["1815 births", "1876 deaths", "People from Osona", "Catalan urban planners", "Urban theorists", "Spanish engineers", "Catalan engineers", "History of Barcelona", "Burials at Montju\u00efc Cemetery", "Use dmy dates from September 2020", "Biography with signature", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2011", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nIn this Catalan name, the first or paternal surname is  Cerd\u00e0 and the second or maternal family name is  Sunyer; both are generally joined by the conjunction \"i\".\nIldefons Cerd\u00e0Portrait by Ramon Mart\u00ed AlsinaBornIldefons Cerd\u00e0 i SunyerCentelles, Catalonia, SpainDied21 August 1876(1876-08-21) (aged\u00a060)Las Caldas de Besaya, Los Corrales de Buelna, Cantabria, SpainNationalityCatalanCitizenshipSpainKnown\u00a0forDesigned expansion of Barcelona known as the \"Eixample\"Scientific careerFieldsUrban planner, civil engineer, politician\nSignature\nIldefons Cerd\u00e0 i Sunyer[1] (Catalan pronunciation:\u00a0[ild\u0259\u02c8fons s\u0259\u027e\u02c8\u00f0a i su\u02c8\u0272e]; Centelles, December 23, 1815 \u2013 Caldas de Besaya, August 21, 1876) was the progressive Catalan Spanish urban planner who designed the 19th-century \"extension\" of Barcelona called the Eixample.
