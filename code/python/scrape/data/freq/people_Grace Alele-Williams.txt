{"name": "Grace Alele-Williams", "content": "Grace Alele-Williams (born December 16, 1932) is an educator who made history as the First Nigerian Female Vice-Chancellor at the University of Benin.[1][2][3]  She was also the first Nigerian woman to receive a doctorate degree.[4][5] She is a professor of mathematics education.[6]\n Grace Alele-Williams Born in Warri, Delta state. She attended Government School, Warri, and Queen's College, Lagos. She attended the University College of Ibadan[7] (now University of Ibadan). She obtained a master's degree in Mathematics while teaching at Queen's School, Ede in Osun State in 1957 and her Ph.D in Mathematics Education at the University of Chicago (U.S.) in 1963.[7] She made history as the first Nigerian woman to be awarded a doctorate degree. She returned to Nigeria for a couple of years' postdoctoral work at the University of Ibadan before joining the University of Lagos in 1965.[8]\n Her teaching career started at Queen's School, Ede Osun State, where she was mathematics teacher from 1954 until 1957.[9] She left for the University of Vermont to become a graduate assistant and later assistant professor. Between 1963 and '65, Alele-Williams was a postdoctoral research fellow, department (and institute) of Education, University of Ibadan from where she was appointed a professor of mathematics at the University of Lagos in 1976.[2] She was the first female Vice Chancellor in Nigeria.\n She has held and served in various capacities. By serving in various committees and boards, Alele-Williams had made useful contributions in the development of education in Nigeria. She was chairman of the curriculum review committee, former Bendel State 1973\u20131979.[10][11][12] From 1979 to 1985, she served as chairman of the Lagos State Curriculum Review Committee and Lagos State Examinations Boards.[13]\n Alele-Williams was a member of governing council, UNESCO Institute of Education.[6][14] She is also a consultant to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and Institute of International Education Planning.[15][16] For a decade (1963\u201373) she was a member of the African Mathematics Programme, located in Newton, Massachusetts, United States.[2] She was also vice-president of the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education and later president of the Nigeria chapter.[12] In 1974, Alele-Williams has published a book titled Modern Mathematics Handbook for Teachers. \nAfter serving as the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Benin, she joined the board of directors of Chevron-Texaco Nigeria. She is also on the board of HIP Asset Management Company Ltd, an Asset Management Company in Lagos, Nigeria.[17] Professor Grace Awani Alele-Williams was a force to reckon with in the dark period for Nigeria's higher education.  Then, the activities of secret cults, confraternities and societies had spread within the Nigerian Universities especially in University of Benin.  She made valuable impacts, with combination of courage, ingenuity and strategy that the growing tide of cultism was stemmed in the university.  A task which many men had failed, she was able to make notable contributions.[18]\n She has a special interest in women education. While spending a decade directing the Institute of Education, she introduced innovative non degree programmes, allowing older women working as elementary school teachers to receive certificates. Alele-Williams has always demonstrated concern for the access of female African students to scientific and technological subjects.[19]\n Alele Williams was the first president of the African Mathematical Union commission on women in mathematics.[20]\n ", "tags": ["1932 births", "Living people", "People from Warri", "Alumni of University of London Worldwide", "Alumni of the University of London", "University of Ibadan alumni", "Queen's College, Lagos alumni", "University of Vermont alumni", "University of Chicago alumni", "Nigerian mathematicians", "Nigerian women academics", "University of Vermont faculty", "University of Lagos faculty", "Nigerian expatriate academics in the United States", "Vice-Chancellors of Nigerian universities", "Nigerian women's history", "University of Benin (Nigeria) faculty", "20th-century Nigerian mathematicians", "21st-century mathematicians", "20th-century Nigerian women", "21st-century Nigerian women", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Nigerian expatriates in the United States", "Women heads of universities and colleges", "Nigerian corporate directors", "Nigerian women business executives", "African women mathematicians", "Women corporate directors", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from May 2020", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Mathematician\nGrace Alele-Williams (born December 16, 1932) is an educator who made history as the First Nigerian Female Vice-Chancellor at the University of Benin.[1][2][3]  She was also the first Nigerian woman to receive a doctorate degree.[4][5] She is a professor of mathematics education.[6]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Academic career\n3 Publications\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nGrace Alele-Williams Born in Warri, Delta state.
