A student of the great Theodor Fischer, he took the view that each building should be uniquely developed according to the specific demands of the site and client.  Few of H\u00e4ring's designs were built but he was a strong influence on his friend and colleague Hans Scharoun.  One built design was a contribution to the Siemensstadt housing project in Berlin from 1929 through 1931, which was master-planned by Scharoun.\n H\u00e4ring was a founding member of both The Ring and CIAM. He was married to actress Emilia Unda in 1918. the couple would later divorce and he would marry actress Roma Bahn in 1950.
