{"name": "Serge Dassault", "content": "Serge Dassault (French:\u00a0[s\u025b\u0281\u0292 daso]; born Serge Paul Andr\u00e9 Bloch; 4 April 1925\u00a0\u2013 28 May 2018) was a French engineer, businessman and politician.[1] He was the chairman and chief executive officer of Dassault Group, and a conservative politician. According to Forbes, Dassault's net worth was estimated in 2016 at US$15 billion.[2]\n He was the younger son of Madeleine Dassault (n\u00e9e Minckes)[3] and Marcel Dassault (born Marcel Ferdinand Bloch),[4] from whom he inherited the Dassault Group. Both his parents were of Jewish heritage, but later converted to Roman Catholicism. \n In 1929, his father founded what is now Dassault Aviation.[5] During the Second World War, he was jailed when his father was sent to Buchenwald for refusing any cooperation from his company, Bordeaux-A\u00e9ronautique, directed by Henri D\u00e9plante, Andr\u00e9 Curvale and Claude de Cambronne, with the German aviation industry.[citation needed]\n He studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Janson de Sailly. He earned engineering degrees from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique (class of 1946) and Supa\u00e9ro (class of 1951). In 1963, he received an Executive MBA from HEC Paris.[6]\n After his father's death in 1986, Serge Dassault continued developing the company, with the help of CEOs Charles Edelstenne and \u00c9ric Trappier.[citation needed] His group also owned the newspaper Le Figaro. In December 1998, he was sentenced to two years' probation in the Belgian Agusta scandal, and was fined 60,000 Belgian francs (about \u20ac1,500).[citation needed]\n According to Forbes, the Dassault family also owns a winery, property in Paris, and an art auction house.[7]\n Dassault was a member of the Union for a Popular Movement political party, as was his son Olivier, who was a deputy in the National Assembly. He was a former mayor of the city of Corbeil-Essonnes, a southern suburb of Paris.[citation needed]\n In 2004, he became a senator, and in that position, he was an outspoken advocate of conservative positions on economic and employment issues, claiming that France's taxes and workforce regulations ruin its entrepreneurs.[citation needed] In 2005, he inaugurated the \u20ac2 million Islamic cultural centre (comprising a mosque) in his city of Corbeil-Essonnes.[8] In November 2012, responding to the Ayrault government's plan to legalise same-sex marriage, he controversially said, during an interview for France Culture, that authorising it would cause \"no more renewal of the population. [...] We'll have a country of homosexuals. And so in ten years there'll be nobody left. It's stupid\".[9]\n Dassault married Nicole Raffel on 5 July 1950. They had four children: Olivier, Laurent, Thierry, and Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.[10][user-generated source]\n He died suddenly in his office at the Dassault Group headquarters in Paris on 28 May 2018, from heart failure at the age of 93.[11][5]\n ", "tags": ["1925 births", "2018 deaths", "Politicians from Paris", "Dassault family", "French Roman Catholics", "French people of Jewish descent", "National Centre of Independents and Peasants politicians", "Rally for the Republic politicians", "Union for a Popular Movement politicians", "Gaullism, a way forward for France", "French Senators of the Fifth Republic", "Mayors of places in \u00cele-de-France", "French chief executives", "French aerospace engineers", "Corps de l'armement", "Businesspeople in aviation", "Dassault Group", "French billionaires", "Converts to Roman Catholicism from Judaism", "French magazine publishers (people)", "French mass media owners", "French male writers", "20th-century French newspaper publishers (people)", "21st-century French newspaper publishers (people)", "Lyc\u00e9e Janson-de-Sailly alumni", "Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Louis alumni", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni", "Supa\u00e9ro alumni", "HEC Paris alumni", "Grand Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Recipients of the Aeronautical Medal", "Senators of Essonne", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles to be expanded from February 2017", "All articles to be expanded", "Government and politics articles needing translation from French Wikipedia", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from May 2018", "Articles to be expanded from May 2018", "Articles using small message boxes", "Accuracy disputes from May 2018", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French businessman and politician (1925\u20132018)\nThis article may be expanded with text translated from the corresponding article in French.
