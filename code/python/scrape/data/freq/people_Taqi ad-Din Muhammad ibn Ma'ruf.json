He was the author of more than ninety books on a wide variety of subjects, including astronomy, clocks, engineering, mathematics, mechanics, optics and natural philosophy.[1]\n In 1574 the Ottoman Sultan Murad III invited Taqi ad-Din to build an observatory in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul. Using his exceptional knowledge in the mechanical arts, Taqi ad-Din constructed instruments like huge armillary and mechanical clocks that he used in his observations of the Great Comet of 1577. He also used European celestial and terrestrial globes that were delivered to Istanbul in gift exchanges. \n The major work that resulted from his work in the observatory is titled \"The tree of ultimate knowledge [in the end of time or the world] in the Kingdom of the Revolving Spheres: The astronomical tables of the King of Kings [Murad III]\" (Sidrat al-muntah al-afkar fi malk\u016bt al-falak al-daw\u0101r\u2013 al-zij al-Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101hi). The work was prepared according to the results of the observations carried out in Egypt and Istanbul in order to correct and complete Ulugh Beg's Zij as-Sultani. The first 40 pages of the work deal with calculations, followed by discussions of astronomical clocks, heavenly circles, and information about three eclipses which he observed at Cairo and Istanbul. For corroborating data of other observations of eclipses in other locales like Daud ar-Riyyadi (David the Mathematician), David Ben-Shushan of Salonika.\n As a polymath, Taqi al-Din wrote numerous books on astronomy, mathematics, mechanics, and theology. His method of finding coordinates of stars were reportedly so precise that he got better measurements than his contemporaries, Tycho Brahe and Nicolas Copernicus. Brahe is also thought to have been aware of Taqi al-Din's work.[2]\n Taqi ad-Din also described a steam turbine with the practical application of rotating a spit in 1551.[3] He worked on and created astronomical clocks for his observatory.[4] Taqi ad-Din also wrote a book on optics, in which he determined the light emitted from objects, proved the Law of Reflection observationally, and worked on refraction.[5]\n Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn was born in Damascus in 1526 according to most sources. His ethnicity has been described as Ottoman Arab,[6] Ottoman Turkish[7] and Ottoman Syrian.[8] In his treatise, titled \"Ray\u1e25\u0101nat al-r\u016b\u1e25\", Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn himself claimed descent from the Ayyubids[9][10] tracing his lineage back to the Ayyubid prince Nasir al-Din Mankarus ibn Nasih al-Din Khumartekin who ruled Abu Qubays in Syria during the 12th century.[11] The Encyclopaedia of Islam makes no mention of his ethnicity, simply calling him, \"..the most important astronomer of Ottoman Turkey\".[12]\n Taqi ad-Din's education started in theology and as he went on he would gain an interest in the rational sciences. Following his interest, he would begin to study the rational sciences in Damascus and Cairo. During that time he studied alongside his father Ma\u02bfruf Efendi. Al-D\u012bn went on to teach at various madaris and served as a qadi, or judge, in Palestine, Damascus, and Cairo. He stayed in Egypt and Damascus for some time and while he was there he created work in astronomy and mathematics. His work in these categories would eventually become important. He became a chief astronomer to the Sultan in 1571 a year after he came to Istanbul, replacing Mustafa ibn Ali al-Muwaqqit.[13][3]\n Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn maintained a strong bond with the people from the Ulama and statesmen. He would pass on information to Sultan Murad III who had an interest in astronomy but also in astrology. The information stated that Ulugh Beg Zij had particular observational errors. Al-D\u012bn made a suggestions that those errors could be fixed if there were new observations made. He also suggested that an observatory should be created in Istanbul to make that situation easier. Murad III would become a patron of the first observatory in Istanbul. He preferred that construction for the new observatory begin immediately. Since Murad III was the patron he would assist with finances for the project.[13]\n Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn continued his studies at the Galata Tower while this was going on. His studies would continue until 1577 at the nearly complete observatory, which was called Dar al-Rasad al-Jadid. This new observatory contained a library that held books which covered astronomy and mathematics. The observatory, built in the higher part of Tophane in Istanbul, was made of two separate buildings. One building was big and the other one was small. Al-D\u012bn possessed some of the instruments used in the old Islamic observatories. He had those instruments reproduced and also created new instruments which would be used for observational purposes. The staff at the new observatory consisted of sixteen people. Eight of them were observers or rasids, four of them were clerks, and the last four were assistants.[13]\n Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn approached his observations in a creative way and created new answers to astronomical problems due to the new strategies he created along with the new equipment he created as well. He would go on to create trigonometric tables based on decimal fractions. These tables placed the ecliptic at 23\u00b0 28' 40\". The current value was 23\u00b0 27' showing that al-D\u012bn's instruments and methods were more precise. Al-D\u012bn used a new method to calculate solar parameters and to determine the magnitude of the annual movement of the sun's apogee as 63 seconds. The known value today is 61 seconds. Copernicus came up with 24 seconds and Tycho Brahe had 45 seconds but al-D\u012bn was more accurate than both.[13]\n The main purpose behind the observatory was to cater to the needs of the astronomers and provide a library and workshop so they could design and produce instruments. This observatory would become one of the largest ones in the Islamic world. It was complete in 1579. It would go on to run until January 22, 1580 which is when it was destroyed. Some say religious arguments was the reason why it was destroyed, but it really came down to political problems. A report by the grand vizier Sinan Pasha to Sultan Murad III goes into how the Sultan and the vizier attempted to keep Taq\u012b Ad-D\u012bn away from the ulama because it seemed like they wanted to take him to trial for heresy. The vizier informs the sultan that Taq\u012b Ad-D\u012bn wanted to go to Syria regardless of the sultan's orders. The vizier also warned the sultan that if Taq\u012b Ad-D\u012bn went there, there is a possibility that he would be noticed by the ulama who would take him to trial.[13]\n Despite Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn's originality, his influence seemed to be limited. There are only a small number of surviving copies of his works so they were not able to reach a wide variety of people. His commentaries that are known are very few. However, one of his works and a piece of a library that he owned reached western Europe pretty quickly. This was due to the manuscript collecting efforts of Jacob Golius, a Dutch professor of Arabic and mathematics at Leiden University. Golius traveled to Istanbul in the early seventeenth century. In 1629 he wrote a letter to Constantin Huygens that talks about seeing Taq\u012b Ad-D\u012bn's work on optics in Istanbul. He argued that he was not able to get ahold of it from his friends even after all his efforts. He must have succeeded in acquiring it later since Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn's work on optics would eventually make it to the Bodleian Library as Marsh 119. It was originally in the Golius collection so it is clear that Golius eventually succeeded at acquiring it.[13]\n According to Salomon Schweigger, the chaplain of Habsburg ambassador Johann Joachim von Sinzendorf, Taqi al-Din was a charlatan who deceived Sultan Murad III and had him spent enormous resources.[14]\n Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn was both the founder and director of the Constantinople Observatory, which is also known as the Istanbul Observatory.[15] This observatory is frequently said to be one of Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn's most important contributions to sixteenth-century Islamic and Ottoman astronomy.[3] In fact, it is known as one of the largest observatories in Islamic history. It is often compared to Tycho Brahe's Uraniborg Observatory, which was said to have been the home to the best instruments of its time in Europe. As a matter of fact, Brahe and Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn have frequently been compared for their work in sixteenth-century astronomy.[3] The founding of the Constantinople Observatory began when Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn returned to Istanbul in 1570, after spending 20 years in Egypt developing his astronomy and mathematical knowledge.[15] Shortly after his return, Sultan Sel\u012bm II appointed Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn as the head astronomer (M\u00fcneccimbast),  following the death of the previous head astronomer Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 ibn \u0481Al\u012b al-Muwaqqit in 1571.[15] During the early years of his position as head astronomer, Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn worked in both the Galata Tower and a building overlooking Tophane.[15] While working in these buildings, he began to gain the support and trust of many important Turkish officials. These newfound relationships lead to an imperial edict in 1569 from Sultan Murad III, which called for the construction of the Constantinople Observatory. This observatory became home to many important books and instruments, as well as many renowned scholars of the time. While there is not much known of the architectural characteristics of the building, there are many depictions of the scholars and astronomical instruments present in the observatory. However, due to political conflict, this observatory was short lived.[16] It was closed 1579 and, was demolished entirely by the state on 22 January 1580, only 11 short years after the imperial edict for its construction.[15]\n The rise and fall of Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn and his observatory depended on political issues that surrounded him. Due to his father's occupation as a professor at the Damascene College of law Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn spent much of his life in Syria and Egypt. During his trips to Istanbul he was able to make connections with many scholar-jurists. He was also able to use the private library of the Grand Vizier of the time, Semiz Ali Pasha. He then began working under Sultan Murad III's new Grand Vizier's, private mentor Sa'deddin. Continuing his research on observations of the heavens while in Egypt Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn used the Galata tower and Sa'deddin's private residence. Although Murad III was the one who commanded an observatory to be built it was actually Sa'deddin who brought the idea to him knowing about his interest in science.[17] The Sultan ultimately would provide Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn with everything he needed from financial assistance for the physical buildings, to intellectual assistance making sure he had easy access to many types of books he would need. When the Sultan decided to create the observatory he saw it as a way to show off the power his monarchy had besides just financially backing it. Murad III showed his power by bringing Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn and some of the most accomplished men in the field of astronomy together to work towards one goal and not only have them work well together but also make progress in the field.[17] Murad III made sure that there was proof of his accomplishments by having his court historiographer Seyyid Lokman keep very detailed records of the work going on at the observatory. Seyyid Lokman wrote that his sultan's monarchy was much more powerful than others in Iraq, Persia, and Anatolia.[17] He also claimed that Murad III was above other monarchs because the results of the observatory were new to the world and replaced many others.[17]\n Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn used a variety of instruments to aid in his work at the observatory. Some were instruments that were already in use from European Astronomers while others he invented himself. While working in this observatory, Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn not only operated many previously created instruments and techniques, but he also developed numerous new ones.[15]  Of these novel inventions, the automatic-mechanical clock is regarded as one of the most important developed in the Constantinople Observatory.[3]\n Before the sixteenth century European mechanical clocks were not in high demand. This lack of demand was brought on by the extremely high prices and the lack of preciseness needed by the population who had to calculate when they would have to have the prayer. The use of hourglasses, water clocks, and sundials was more than enough to meet their needs.[19]\n It was not until around 1547 that the Ottomans started creating a high demand for them. Initially, it was started by the gifts brought by the Austrians but this would end up starting a market for the clocks. European clockmakers began to create clocks designed to the tastes and needs of the Ottoman people. They did this by showing both the phases of the moon and by utilizing Ottoman numbers.[19]\n Due to this high demand for mechanical clocks, Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn was asked by the Grand Vizier to create a clock that would show exactly when the call to prayer was. This would lead him to write his first book on the construction of mechanical clocks called, \"al-Kawakib al-Durriya fi Bengamat al-Dawriyya\" in 1563 A.D. which he used throughout his research at the short-lived observatory.[20] He believed that it would be advantageous to bring a \"true hermetic and distilled perception of the motion of the heavenly bodies.\"[21] In order to get a better understanding of how clocks ran Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn took the time to gain knowledge from many European clock makers as well as going into the treasury of Semiz Ali Pasha and learning anything he could from the many clocks he owned.[19]\n Of the clocks in the Grand Vizier's treasury Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn examined three different types. Those three were weight driven, spring driven, and clocks with lever escapement. In his writing, he spoke of these three types of watches but he also made comments on pocket watches and astronomical ones. As Chief Astronomer Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn created a mechanical astronomical clock. This clock was made in order for him to be able to take more precise measurements from his observations done at the Constantinople observatory. As stated above the creation of this clock was thought to be one of the most important astronomical discoveries of the sixteenth century. According to his writing in his booIn the nabk tree of the extremity of thoughts Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn constructed a mechanical clock with three dials which show the hours, minutes, and seconds, with each minute consisting of five seconds.[4] After this clock it is not known whether Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn's work in mechanical clocks was ever continued since much of the clock making after that time in the Ottoman Empire was taken over by Europeans.\n In 1551 Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn described a self-rotating spit that is important in the history of the steam turbine. In Al-Turuq al-samiyya fi al-alat al-ruhaniyya (The Sublime Methods of Spiritual Machines) al-D\u012bn describes this machine as well as some practical applications for it. The spit is rotated by directing steam into the vanes which then turns the wheel at the end of the axel.[22] Al-D\u012bn also described four water-raising machines. The first two are animal driven water pumps. The third and fourth are both driven by a paddle wheel. The third is a slot-rod pump while the fourth is a six-cylinder pump. The vertical pistons of the final machine are operated by cams and trip-hammers, run by the paddle wheel.[22] The descriptions of these machines predates many of the more modern engines. The screw pump, for example, that al-D\u012bn describes predates Agricola, whose description of the rag and chain pump was published in 1556. The two pump engine, which was first described by al-Jazar\u012b, was also the basis of the steam engine.[23]\n ", "tags": ["1521 births", "1585 deaths", "Syrian scientists", "Syrian astronomers", "Syrian mathematicians", "Scientists of the Ottoman Empire", "Astronomers of the Ottoman Empire", "Mathematicians of the Ottoman Empire", "Engineers of the Ottoman Empire", "Inventors of the Ottoman Empire", "16th-century physicians of the Ottoman Empire", "People from Damascus", "16th-century Arabic writers", "16th-century writers of the Ottoman Empire", "16th-century astronomers", "Scientific instrument makers", "Clockmakers of the Ottoman Empire", "16th-century mathematicians", "Inventors of medieval Islam", "16th-century scientists", "Muslim inventors", "CS1 maint: others", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Arabic-language text", "Articles containing Ottoman Turkish (1500-1928)-language text", "Articles containing Turkish-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with TDV\u0130A identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Ottoman Syrian polymath (1526-1585)\nTaqi al-DinWork in the observatory of Taqi ad-DinBorn1526Damascus, Ottoman EmpireDied1585Istanbul, Ottoman EmpireKnown\u00a0forConstantinople observatoryScientific careerFieldsMathematics, astronomy, engineering, mechanics, optics, natural philosophy\n\nTaqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf ash-Shami al-Asadi (Arabic: \u062a\u0642\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645\u064a\u200e, Ottoman Turkish: \u062a\u0642\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u062f\u064a\u200e, Turkish: Takiy\u00fcddin; 1526-1585) was an Ottoman polymath active in Cairo and Istanbul.

Due to his father's occupation as a professor at the Damascene College of law Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn spent much of his life in Syria and Egypt. During his trips to Istanbul he was able to make connections with many scholar-jurists. He was also able to use the private library of the Grand Vizier of the time, Semiz Ali Pasha. He then began working under Sultan Murad III's new Grand Vizier's, private mentor Sa'deddin. Continuing his research on observations of the heavens while in Egypt Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn used the Galata tower and Sa'deddin's private residence. Although Murad III was the one who commanded an observatory to be built it was actually Sa'deddin who brought the idea to him knowing about his interest in science.[17] The Sultan ultimately would provide Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn with everything he needed from financial assistance for the physical buildings, to intellectual assistance making sure he had easy access to many types of books he would need. When the Sultan decided to create the observatory he saw it as a way to show off the power his monarchy had besides just financially backing it. Murad III showed his power by bringing Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn and some of the most accomplished men in the field of astronomy together to work towards one goal and not only have them work well together but also make progress in the field.[17] Murad III made sure that there was proof of his accomplishments by having his court historiographer Seyyid Lokman keep very detailed records of the work going on at the observatory. Seyyid Lokman wrote that his sultan's monarchy was much more powerful than others in Iraq, Persia, and Anatolia.[17] He also claimed that Murad III was above other monarchs because the results of the observatory were new to the world and replaced many others.[17]\n\nInstruments used at the Observatory[edit]\nTaq\u012b al-D\u012bn used a variety of instruments to aid in his work at the observatory. Some were instruments that were already in use from European Astronomers while others he invented himself. While working in this observatory, Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn not only operated many previously created instruments and techniques, but he also developed numerous new ones.[15]  Of these novel inventions, the automatic-mechanical clock is regarded as one of the most important developed in the Constantinople Observatory.[3]\n\nEach of these instruments were first described by Ptolemy.[15]\nAn Armillary Sphere- A model of celestial bodies with rings that represent longitude and latitude.\nA Paralactic Ruler- also known as a Triquetrum was used to calculate the altitudes of celestial bodies.\nAn Astrolabe- Measures the inclined position of celestial bodies.\nThese instruments were created by Muslim astronomers.[15]\nA Mural quadrant, a type of mural Instrument for measuring angles from 0 to 90 degrees.\nAn Azimuthally Quadrant\nEach of the instruments were created by Taqi al-Din to use for his own work.[15]A Parallel rulerA Ruler Quadrant or Wooden Quadrant an instrument with two holes for the measurement of apparent diameters and eclipses.A mechanical clock with a train of cogwheels which helped measure the true ascension of the stars.Mu\u015fabbaha bi'l-menat\u0131k, an instrument with chords to determine the equinoxes, invented to replace the equinoctial armillary.[4]\nA Sunaydi Ruler which was apparently a special type of instrument of an auxiliary nature, the function of which was explained by Alaeddin el-Mansur[18]\nContributions[edit]\nClock mechanics[edit]\nRise of clock use in the Ottoman Empire[edit]\nBefore the sixteenth century European mechanical clocks were not in high demand. This lack of demand was brought on by the extremely high prices and the lack of preciseness needed by the population who had to calculate when they would have to have the prayer. The use of hourglasses, water clocks, and sundials was more than enough to meet their needs.[19]\nIt was not until around 1547 that the Ottomans started creating a high demand for them. Initially, it was started by the gifts brought by the Austrians but this would end up starting a market for the clocks. European clockmakers began to create clocks designed to the tastes and needs of the Ottoman people. They did this by showing both the phases of the moon and by utilizing Ottoman numbers.[19]\n\nTaq\u012b al-D\u012bn's work[edit]\nDue to this high demand for mechanical clocks, Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn was asked by the Grand Vizier to create a clock that would show exactly when the call to prayer was. This would lead him to write his first book on the construction of mechanical clocks called, \"al-Kawakib al-Durriya fi Bengamat al-Dawriyya\" in 1563 A.D. which he used throughout his research at the short-lived observatory.[20] He believed that it would be advantageous to bring a \"true hermetic and distilled perception of the motion of the heavenly bodies.\"[21] In order to get a better understanding of how clocks ran Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn took the time to gain knowledge from many European clock makers as well as going into the treasury of Semiz Ali Pasha and learning anything he could from the many clocks he owned.[19]\n\nTypes of clocks examined[edit]\nOf the clocks in the Grand Vizier's treasury Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn examined three different types. Those three were weight driven, spring driven, and clocks with lever escapement. In his writing, he spoke of these three types of watches but he also made comments on pocket watches and astronomical ones. As Chief Astronomer Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn created a mechanical astronomical clock. This clock was made in order for him to be able to take more precise measurements from his observations done at the Constantinople observatory. As stated above the creation of this clock was thought to be one of the most important astronomical discoveries of the sixteenth century. According to his writing in his booIn the nabk tree of the extremity of thoughts Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn constructed a mechanical clock with three dials which show the hours, minutes, and seconds, with each minute consisting of five seconds.[4] After this clock it is not known whether Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn's work in mechanical clocks was ever continued since much of the clock making after that time in the Ottoman Empire was taken over by Europeans.\n\nSteam[edit]\nIn 1551 Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn described a self-rotating spit that is important in the history of the steam turbine. In Al-Turuq al-samiyya fi al-alat al-ruhaniyya (The Sublime Methods of Spiritual Machines) al-D\u012bn describes this machine as well as some practical applications for it. The spit is rotated by directing steam into the vanes which then turns the wheel at the end of the axel.[22] Al-D\u012bn also described four water-raising machines. The first two are animal driven water pumps. The third and fourth are both driven by a paddle wheel. The third is a slot-rod pump while the fourth is a six-cylinder pump. The vertical pistons of the final machine are operated by cams and trip-hammers, run by the paddle wheel.[22] The descriptions of these machines predates many of the more modern engines. The screw pump, for example, that al-D\u012bn describes predates Agricola, whose description of the rag and chain pump was published in 1556. The two pump engine, which was first described by al-Jazar\u012b, was also the basis of the steam engine.[23]\n\nImportant works[edit]\nAstronomy[edit]\nSidrat muntah\u0101 al-afk\u0101r f\u012b malak\u016bt al-falak al-daww\u0101r (al-Z\u012bj al-Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h\u012b): this is said to be one of Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn's most important works in astronomy. He completed this book on the basis of his observations in both Egypt and Istanbul. The purpose of this work was to improve, correct, and ultimately complete Z\u012bj-i Ulugh Beg, which was a project devised in Samarkand and furthered in the Constantinople Observatory. The first 40 pages of his writing focus on trigonometric calculations, with emphasis on trigonometric functions such sine, cosine, tangent, and cotangent.[15]\nJar\u012bdat al-durar wa khar\u012bdat al-fikar is a z\u012bj that is said to be Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn's second most important work in astronomy. This z\u012bj contains the first recorded use of decimal fractions and trigonometric functions in astronomical tables. He also gives the parts of degree of curves and angles in decimal fractions with precise calculations.[15]\nDust\u016br al-tarj\u012b\u1e25 li-qaw\u0101 \u0481 id al-tas\u1e6d\u012b\u1e25 is another important work by Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn, which focuses on the projection of a sphere into a plane, among other geometric topics.\nTaq\u012b al-Din is also accredited as the author of Ray\u1e25\u0101nat al-r\u016b\u1e25 f\u012b rasm al-s\u0101 \u0481 \u0101t \u0481 al\u0101 mustaw\u012b al-su\u1e6d\u016b\u1e25, which discusses sundials and their characteristics drawn on a marble surface.[15]\nClocks and mechanics[edit]\nal-Kaw\u0101kib al-durriyya f\u012b wa\u1e0d \u0481 al-bank\u0101m\u0101t al-dawriyya was written by Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn in 1559 and addressed mechanical-automatic clocks. This work is considered the first written work on mechanical-automatic clocks in the Islamic and Ottoman world. In this book, he accredits Al\u012b Pasha as a contributor for allowing him to use and study his private library and collection of European mechanical clocks.[15]al-\u1e6curuq al-saniyya f\u012b al-\u0101l\u0101t al-r\u016b\u1e25\u0101niyya is a second book on mechanics by Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn that emphasizes the geometrical-mechanical structure of clocks, which was a topic previously observed and studied by Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 and Ismail al-Jazari (Ab\u016b al-\u0481Izz al-Jazar\u012b).[15]\nPhysics and optics[edit]\nNawr \u1e25ad\u012bqat al-ab\u1e63ar wa-n\u016br \u1e25aq\u012bqat al-An\u1e93ar was a work of Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn that discussed physics and optics. This book discussed the structure of light, the relationship between light and color, as well as diffusion and global refraction.[15]\nSee also[edit]\nInventions in the Muslim world\nIslamic astronomy\nIslamic science\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Taqi al-Din Ibn Ma'ruf: A Bio-Bibliographical Essay | Muslim Heritage\". muslimheritage.com.
