{"name": "Jorge Ferreira Chaves", "content": "Jorge Ferreira Chaves (22 February 1920 \u2013 22 August 1981) was a Portuguese architect.\n Some authors may refer to him as \"Jorge Chaves\" or simply \"Chaves\".\n He was one of the architects responsible, in the latter part of the 1940s, for the establishment of the Modern Movement in Portugal.[1]\n Professionally active between 1941 and 1981, he is considered one of the most perfectionist Portuguese architects.[2] From 1946, in his office, he developed several dozens of projects for continental Portugal, the island of Madeira, Portuguese Guinea and Angola.[3][4]\n He also collaborated with some of Lisbon's most important architectural offices of the first half of the 20th century:[3] those of Joaquim Ferreira, Miguel Jacobetty Rosa and Porf\u00edrio Pardal Monteiro.\n Jorge Ribeiro Ferreira Chaves was born on 22 February 1920, in Ponta do Sol, municipal seat of Ribeira Grande, on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o in Portuguese Cape Verde.\n He was the son of Portuguese civil engineer and inventor Raul Pires Ferreira Chaves and Elvira da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Ribeiro Ferreira Chaves. He was also brother of Maria Helena da Costa Dias. He was also nephews of Maria Alexandrina Pires Ferreira Chaves, Ol\u00edmpio Ferreira Chaves and Jo\u00e3o Carlos Pires Ferreira Chaves.\n From 1931 he lived in Lisbon.\n He studied architecture at the Escola de Belas Artes de Lisboa (English: Lisbon School of Fine Arts), having entered in 1935.[5]\n In 1941, his degree program was interrupted because of military service during World War II,[5] stationed with Portuguese expeditionary forces on the island of S\u00e3o Miguel in the Azores. He remained on the island until 1944.\n He rejoined the School of Fine Arts in 1944 to finish the architecture degree and was awarded the 1946 Jos\u00e9 Luis Monteiro Prize,[5] which included a monetary stipend for students achieving academic excellence. The prize was significant, since it had not been awarded the previous years, and had accumulated. Simultaneously, in 1946-1947, he attended the Sculpture degree.[5]\nIn 1948, he graduated in architecture.\n In his diploma application exam (Portuguese: Concurso para a Obten\u00e7\u00e3o do Diploma de Arquitecto - CODA), in 1953, Jorge Chaves obtained a significant passing grade: 19 out of 20.[5]\n His professional career started during the period of 1943-1956; a period which Nuno Portas[6] has designated as the stage of \"resistance\" in Portuguese architecture and art. From 1944 to 1946, in the final years at university, he collaborated with architect Joaquim Ferreira. During this period, he also collaborated, occasionally, with architects Filipe Nobre de Figueiredo and Alberto Soeiro.\n In 1946 he set up his first office together with his graduation classmate Lu\u00eds Coelho Borges.\n He was a member of ICAT - Iniciativas Culturais Arte e T\u00e9cnica (English: Culture, Arts and Techniques Initiatives) and also of the Sociedade Nacional de Belas-Artes (English: National Society of Fine Arts). He participated in four sessions of the EGAP Exposi\u00e7\u00f5es Gerais de Artes Pl\u00e1sticas (English: General Exhibitions of Visual Arts) by presenting architectural projects. In 1948, he participated in the 1\u00ba Congresso Nacional de Arquitectura (English: 1st National Congress of Architecture).\n In parallel with project activity in his own office, he collaborated with the office of architect Miguel Jacobetty Rosa, between 1948 and 1952, and did an internship under the direction of architect Hern\u00e2ni Gandra during 1951.[5]\n In 1952 he was invited to the office of the architect Porf\u00edrio Pardal Monteiro, with whom he worked in designing the Pal\u00e1cio da Rotunda[7] and Sorel buildings,[8] but especially the Hotel Ritz in Lisbon, \"a remarkable work, for its aesthetic wisdom and excellence of material execution \".[9]\nDuring architect Porf\u00edrio Pardal Monteiro illness and after his death in 1957, he ensured the continuity of the project of the hotel, by giving assistance to the construction and by heading the phase of execution in a special office built in the site,[10] until its inauguration in 1959.[2][9]\n Although the design of Hotel Ritz was his core activity from 1952 to 1959, he kept his own office to which he was exclusively dedicated after 1959.\n Several of his major works, such as the \u201cPastelaria Mexicana\u201d (cafe), the \u201cPalissi Galvani\u201d shop and the Hotel Florida in Lisbon, the Hotel Garbe, the Hotel da Baleeira and the Hotel Globo in the Algarve or the Chamber of Commerce of Bissau in Guinea-Bissau include conceptually integrated visual arts interventions, some created by himself.\n The visual artists Jorge Vieira, Jos\u00e9 Escada, Martins Correia, Paulo Guilherme d'E\u00e7a Leal, Sena da Silva, Hein Semke, Querubim Lapa, Mario Costa, Ant\u00f3nio Alfredo and Jo\u00e3o C\u00e2mara Leme were invited to intervene in his works.\n In his career, he was accompanied in some of the listed projects, by the associated architects Lu\u00eds Coelho Borges, \u00c1lvaro Valladas Petersen, Anselmo Fernandez Rodriguez, Eduardo Goulard Medeiros, Artur Pires Martins, C\u00e2ndido Palma de Melo and also by Mario Xavier Antunes, Jorge Her\u00e9dia, Frederico Sant'Ana and V\u00edtor Sousa Figueiredo, who were internship members of his office and carried on collaborating with him.\n His work also developed on the wide urban scale and he had an important role in the development of industrial design in Portugal. For the equipment of his buildings and interior designs, Jorge Ferreira Chaves always designed original furniture or chose mainly Portuguese designed and manufactured fixtures and objects.\n From 1978 to 1981, he designed interventions in public buildings, as an Architect of the Ministry of Public Works (Portuguese: Direc\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral dos Edif\u00edcios e Monumentos Nacionais - DGEMN do Minist\u00e9rio das Obras P\u00fablicas).[4]\n He died in Lisbon on August 22, 1981.\n Please see PROJECTOS E OBRAS of Chaves.\n Please see PROJECTOS E OBRAS of Chaves.\n ", "tags": ["1920 births", "1981 deaths", "People from Santo Ant\u00e3o, Cape Verde", "People from Lisbon", "20th-century Portuguese architects", "Modernist architects", "Expressionist architects", "Organic architecture", "Technical University of Lisbon alumni", "Articles with Portuguese-language sources (pt)", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing explicitly cited English-language text", "Articles containing Portuguese-language text", "Articles to be expanded from January 2011", "All articles to be expanded", "Articles with empty sections from January 2011", "All articles with empty sections", "Articles using small message boxes", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from April 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "Jorge Ferreira ChavesBorn(1920-02-22)22 February 1920Ponta do Sol, Santo Ant\u00e3o, Portuguese Cape VerdeDied22 August 1981(1981-08-22) (aged\u00a061)LisbonNationalityPortugueseOccupationarchitectAwardsJos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Monteiro Prize (1946)\nJorge Ferreira Chaves (22 February 1920 \u2013 22 August 1981) was a Portuguese architect.\nSome authors may refer to him as \"Jorge Chaves\" or simply \"Chaves\".\nHe was one of the architects responsible, in the latter part of the 1940s, for the establishment of the Modern Movement in Portugal.[1]\nProfessionally active between 1941 and 1981, he is considered one of the most perfectionist Portuguese architects.[2] From 1946, in his office, he developed several dozens of projects for continental Portugal, the island of Madeira, Portuguese Guinea and Angola.[3][4]\nHe also collaborated with some of Lisbon's most important architectural offices of the first half of the 20th century:[3] those of Joaquim Ferreira, Miguel Jacobetty Rosa and Porf\u00edrio Pardal Monteiro.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Education\n1.2 Career\n\n\n2 Buildings and projects\n\n2.1 Built\n2.2 Non-built\n\n\n3 See also\n4 Notes and references\n5 Bibliography\n\n5.1 Books\n5.2 Catalogs and guides\n5.3 Other\n5.4 Magazines\n5.5 Newspapers\n5.6 Television\n5.7 Buildings designed by Jorge Ferreira Chaves used for \u201cDecor\u201d in Portuguese motion pictures\n\n\n6 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nJorge Ribeiro Ferreira Chaves was born on 22 February 1920, in Ponta do Sol, municipal seat of Ribeira Grande, on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o in Portuguese Cape Verde.\nHe was the son of Portuguese civil engineer and inventor Raul Pires Ferreira Chaves and Elvira da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Ribeiro Ferreira Chaves.

From 1944 to 1946, in the final years at university, he collaborated with architect Joaquim Ferreira. During this period, he also collaborated, occasionally, with architects Filipe Nobre de Figueiredo and Alberto Soeiro.\nIn 1946 he set up his first office together with his graduation classmate Lu\u00eds Coelho Borges.\nHe was a member of ICAT - Iniciativas Culturais Arte e T\u00e9cnica (English: Culture, Arts and Techniques Initiatives) and also of the Sociedade Nacional de Belas-Artes (English: National Society of Fine Arts). He participated in four sessions of the EGAP Exposi\u00e7\u00f5es Gerais de Artes Pl\u00e1sticas (English: General Exhibitions of Visual Arts) by presenting architectural projects. In 1948, he participated in the 1\u00ba Congresso Nacional de Arquitectura (English: 1st National Congress of Architecture).\n\nOne of his \"post - 48 Congress\" projects was the Laboratorios Cannobio building, designed in 1948 and built in 1949. This was one of the first buildings to emerge in the Centre of Lisbon displaying an architectural language clearly engaged with the Modern Movement.\nHis project for the street corner of Rua Braancamp 7 with Rua Mouzinho da Silveira would also have been so, had it not been rejected for \"aesthetic reasons\u201d, by the conservative Municipality of Lisbon.\nIn parallel with project activity in his own office, he collaborated with the office of architect Miguel Jacobetty Rosa, between 1948 and 1952, and did an internship under the direction of architect Hern\u00e2ni Gandra during 1951.[5]\nIn 1952 he was invited to the office of the architect Porf\u00edrio Pardal Monteiro, with whom he worked in designing the Pal\u00e1cio da Rotunda[7] and Sorel buildings,[8] but especially the Hotel Ritz in Lisbon, \"a remarkable work, for its aesthetic wisdom and excellence of material execution \".[9]\nDuring architect Porf\u00edrio Pardal Monteiro illness and after his death in 1957, he ensured the continuity of the project of the hotel, by giving assistance to the construction and by heading the phase of execution in a special office built in the site,[10] until its inauguration in 1959.[2][9]\nAlthough the design of Hotel Ritz was his core activity from 1952 to 1959, he kept his own office to which he was exclusively dedicated after 1959.\n\nHis most significant architectural production took place during a period characterized as \"of a relative opening of the (dictatorial) regime to accept modern architecture\".[11] During the 1960s, he developed a specific trait, recognizable in such works as the \u201cPastelaria Mexicana\u201d in Lisbon or the \u201cHotel Garbe\u201d and the \u201cHotel Baleeira\u201d in the Algarve and also in housing in Olivais Sul, Rua da Penha de Fran\u00e7a and Rua da Ilha do Pr\u00edncipe[3] in Lisbon. This latter case has been referred to as \"perhaps the best urban intervention for housing in Lisbon in that decade\".[3][9]\nThe \u201cChamber of Commerce of Bissau\u201d (Portuguese: C\u00e2mara de Com\u00e9rcio de Bissau), the headquarters of the Guinea\u2019s Trade, Industry and Agriculture Association (Portuguese: Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Comercial, Industrial e Agr\u00edcola da Guin\u00e9), is considered the most qualified architectural achievement in Bissau during the colonial period.[12]\nAt the end of the 1950s he produced the \u201cremarkable work of Caixa Geral de Dep\u00f3sitos bank in S\u00e3o Pedro do Sul, clearly influenced by the survey on vernacular architecture in Portugal (Portuguese: Inqu\u00e9rito \u00e0 Arquitectura Popular em Portugal) that was carried out in the late 1950s.[9]\n\"The Pastelaria Mexicana (a Lisbon cafe and snack-bar) is a highly remarkable example that led to the limits, in that period and in Portugal, the expressionist trends created inside the Modern Movement since the early 20th century\" and that \"developed a phenomenological sense of architectural vision that reached a climax, deemed even exceptional, in the history of architecture in Portugal.\"[1]\n\"Broken line profiles and non-straight angles, key elements of an international lineage organicism rediscovered in the 1960s\", are \" brilliantly integrated in this perfect example of \"total design\".\"[3]  The process of its classification as a monument of public interest has been ongoing in IGESPAR since 1996, after an intervention, in that same year, that changed significantly some parts of its architecture. It retains, however, part of the elements that motivated, in 1993, such a proposed classification.\nSeveral of his major works, such as the \u201cPastelaria Mexicana\u201d (cafe), the \u201cPalissi Galvani\u201d shop and the Hotel Florida in Lisbon, the Hotel Garbe, the Hotel da Baleeira and the Hotel Globo in the Algarve or the Chamber of Commerce of Bissau in Guinea-Bissau include conceptually integrated visual arts interventions, some created by himself.\nThe visual artists Jorge Vieira, Jos\u00e9 Escada, Martins Correia, Paulo Guilherme d'E\u00e7a Leal, Sena da Silva, Hein Semke, Querubim Lapa, Mario Costa, Ant\u00f3nio Alfredo and Jo\u00e3o C\u00e2mara Leme were invited to intervene in his works.\nIn his career, he was accompanied in some of the listed projects, by the associated architects Lu\u00eds Coelho Borges, \u00c1lvaro Valladas Petersen, Anselmo Fernandez Rodriguez, Eduardo Goulard Medeiros, Artur Pires Martins, C\u00e2ndido Palma de Melo and also by Mario Xavier Antunes, Jorge Her\u00e9dia, Frederico Sant'Ana and V\u00edtor Sousa Figueiredo, who were internship members of his office and carried on collaborating with him.\nHis work also developed on the wide urban scale and he had an important role in the development of industrial design in Portugal.
