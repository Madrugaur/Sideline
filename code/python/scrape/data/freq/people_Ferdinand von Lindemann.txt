{"name": "Ferdinand von Lindemann", "content": "Carl Louis Ferdinand von Lindemann (April 12, 1852 \u2013 March 6, 1939) was a German mathematician, noted for his proof, published in 1882, that \u03c0 (pi) is a transcendental number, meaning it is not a root of any polynomial with rational coefficients.\n Lindemann was born in Hanover, the capital of the Kingdom of Hanover.  His father, Ferdinand Lindemann, taught modern languages at a Gymnasium in Hanover.  His mother, Emilie Crusius, was the daughter of the Gymnasium's headmaster.  The family later moved to Schwerin, where young Ferdinand attended school.\n He studied mathematics at G\u00f6ttingen, Erlangen, and Munich. At Erlangen he received a doctorate, supervised by Felix Klein,[1] on non-Euclidean geometry. Lindemann subsequently taught in W\u00fcrzburg and at the University of Freiburg. During his time in Freiburg, Lindemann devised his proof that \u03c0 is a transcendental number (see Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem). After his time in Freiburg, Lindemann transferred to the University of K\u00f6nigsberg. While a professor in K\u00f6nigsberg, Lindemann acted as supervisor for the doctoral theses of the mathematicians David Hilbert, Hermann Minkowski, and Arnold Sommerfeld.\n In 1882, Lindemann published the result for which he is best known, the transcendence of \u03c0.  His methods were similar to those used nine years earlier by Charles Hermite to show that e, the base of natural logarithms, is transcendental.  Before the publication of Lindemann's proof, it was known that if \u03c0 was transcendental, then it would be impossible to square the circle by compass and straightedge.\n In xkcd comic 866, Ferdinand von Lindemann is referenced in the alt-text, apparently having used a compass and straightedge to construct the greatest birthday party ever, to\nwhich nobody showed up.\n ", "tags": ["1852 births", "1939 deaths", "19th-century German mathematicians", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Squaring the circle", "Number theorists", "Scientists from Hanover", "People from the Kingdom of Hanover", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg alumni", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni", "University of K\u00f6nigsberg faculty", "Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\nFerdinand von LindemannCarl Louis Ferdinand von LindemannBorn(1852-04-12)April 12, 1852Hannover, German ConfederationDiedMarch 6, 1939(1939-03-06) (aged\u00a086)Munich, GermanyNationalityGermanAlma\u00a0materFriedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnbergKnown\u00a0forProving \u03c0 is a transcendental numberScientific careerFieldsMathematicianInstitutionsUniversity of MunichDoctoral advisorC.
