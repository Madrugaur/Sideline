{"name": "Salomon Bochner", "content": "Salomon Bochner (20 August 1899 \u2013 2 May 1982) was an American mathematician, known for work in mathematical analysis, probability theory and differential geometry.\n He was born into a Jewish family in Podg\u00f3rze (near Krak\u00f3w), then Austria-Hungary, now Poland. Fearful of a Russian invasion in Galicia at the beginning of World War I in 1914, his family moved to Germany, seeking greater security. Bochner was educated at a Berlin gymnasium (secondary school), and then at the University of Berlin. There, he was a student of Erhard Schmidt,[3] writing a dissertation involving what would later be called the Bergman kernel. Shortly after this, he left the academy to help his family during the escalating inflation. After returning to mathematical research, he lectured at the University of Munich from 1924 to 1933. His academic career in Germany ended after the Nazis came to power in 1933, and he left for a position at Princeton University. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1945-48.[5]  He was appointed as Henry Burchard Fine Professor in 1959, retiring in 1968. Although he was seventy years old when he retired from Princeton, Bochner was appointed as Edgar Odell Lovett Professor of Mathematics at Rice University and went on to hold this chair until his death in 1982. He became Head of Department at Rice in 1969 and held this position until 1976. He died in Houston, Texas. He was an Orthodox Jew.[6]\n In 1925 he started work in the area of almost periodic functions, simplifying the approach of Harald Bohr by use of compactness and approximate identity arguments. In 1933 he defined the Bochner integral, as it is now called, for vector-valued functions. Bochner's theorem on Fourier transforms appeared in a 1932 book. His techniques came into their own as Pontryagin duality and then the representation theory of locally compact groups developed in the following years.\n Subsequently, he worked on multiple Fourier series, posing the question of the Bochner\u2013Riesz means. This led to results on how the Fourier transform on Euclidean space behaves under rotations.\n In differential geometry, Bochner's formula on curvature from 1946 was published. Joint work with Kentaro Yano (1912\u20131993) led to the 1953 book Curvature and Betti Numbers. It had consequences, for the Kodaira vanishing theory, representation theory, and spin manifolds. Bochner also worked on several complex variables (the Bochner\u2013Martinelli formula and the book Several Complex Variables from 1948 with W. T. Martin).\n ", "tags": ["1899 births", "1982 deaths", "20th-century German mathematicians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Jewish scientists", "Differential geometers", "Complex analysts", "Mathematical analysts", "Measure theorists", "PDE theorists", "Princeton University faculty", "Rice University faculty", "Polish Orthodox Jews", "American Orthodox Jews", "Jews from Galicia (Eastern Europe)", "Scientists from Berlin", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United States", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Austrian-American mathematician\nSalomon Bochnercirca 1970Born(1899-08-20)20 August 1899Podg\u00f3rze, Austria-HungaryDied2 May 1982(1982-05-02) (aged\u00a082)Houston, TexasAlma\u00a0materUniversity of BerlinKnown\u00a0forBochner integralBochner's theoremAwardsAMS Steele Prize 1979[1][2]Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of Munich Princeton UniversityInstitute for Advanced Study Rice UniversityDoctoral advisorErhard Schmidt[3]Doctoral studentsRichard AskeyEugenio CalabiJeff CheegerM.
