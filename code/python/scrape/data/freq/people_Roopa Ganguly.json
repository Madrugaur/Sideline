I don't mind if my role is not getting enough prominence as long as the character is meaty enough because that's how soaps are made today. I also don't mind if I am given less work. But I am a very sensitive and creative person. I felt that there was no respect for a senior actor like me. Money is everywhere but one doesn't work only for money. If there is no respect for the work one does then money is not worth the effort.\nOn the last day of my shoot for Kasturi, I signed the register but didn't accept my pay-packet because I shot only for a few close-up shots.

Though she made a cameo appearance in it, she garnered huge mass attention as the film was widely advertised on her enthralling dialogue; \"Sagar dekhben naa, shudhu amake dekhun.\" In the film, she rendered her character with a fine, seductive approach, especially in the Eki Labonyo Purna Prate song sequence, where the character played by Soumitra Chatterjee recalls an earlier moment of Ganguly gazing back at him.[65] In 2003, she appeared in Gautam Ghose's Bengali film Abar Aranye, where she played the character of Shimul, a buoyant woman who is grief-stricken at the deepest core of her heart for the probable loss of her husband. She appeared in a cameo role in Bow Barracks forever (2004) by Anjan Dutt.[66]\nIn 2005, she appeared in Rituparno Ghosh's award-winning Bengali film Antarmahal, where she played the character of Mahamaya, a docile wife to an arrogant zamindar. Her performance in the film was hugely appreciated by film critics.[67][68][69] Indian film critic Piyush Roy wrote on her performance in the film, \"Ganguly rekindles memories of her fiery act of Draupadi in B R Chopra\u2019s Mahabharat through her blow hot, blow cold performance.\"[70]\n\n\nRoopa Ganguly's Mahamaya is a worthy contender to lead any listing of memorable women characters from Ghosh's abundant array of some seriously multi-dimensional female protagonists seen on celluloid in recent times. Ganguly rekindles memories of her fiery act of Draupadi in B R Chopra\u2019s Mahabharat through her blow hot, blow cold performance. The film\u2019s narrator may be the British artist, but hers is the character that drives its most dramatic moments and through whom the audience is warned about the catastrophe in waiting. From a jealous, wasted aging wife in the beginning, she seizes screen presence with her every appearance, lacing it with new untapped facets to her personality. To her husband's employees, she is like an incarnation of the goddess-provider, to Jashomati she is the nurturer and to the voyeuristic exploitative priests, she is the ultimate sexual tease. In the zamindar's \"antarmahal\" abounding with women resigned to their fates, she is a thinking, living, sexual being, who sets her own agendas and seeks her own pleasures, almost like a man.\n\u2014 Piyush Roy (Indian film critic)[71]\n\n\nShe herself considered this role as a big challenge as it was inherently contrary to her personality.[35] The film won her the BFJA Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2006. In the same year, she appeared in Sekhar Das's award-winning Bengali film Krantikaal (2005), where she played the character of Subarna, who befriends a terrorist who broke into her house.[72] She appeared in Raj Mukherjee's Bengali film Nagordola (2005), where she portrayed the character of an arrogant and rude woman who gets diagnosed as having throat cancer and realises that life is not like it has conventionally been and gives her full consent to her own unmarried daughter to give birth of her baby and to bring it up. The film was a major hit at the box office for its contemporary social issue. Her performance in the film earn her an Anandalok Award nomination in the Best Actress in the Leading Role category in 2006.[73] She acted in the much acclaimed Bengali film Ek Mutho Chabi (2005), produced by herself, where she played the character of an established actress who has a car accident, consequently losing her career.[74][75] In December 2005, Ganguly was named by The Telegraph in the list of Five Crowning Queens of 2005 alongside Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta, Konkona Sen Sharma and Vidya Balan.[76]\nIn 2006, she accepted a role of a writer in Karam Apnaa Apnaa produced by Balaji Telefilms and shifted her base to Mumbai.[77] She then appeared in Hindi TV series such as Love Story and Agle Janam Mohe Bitiya Hi Kijo (2009).\n\nEverything was fine. I don't mind if my role is not getting enough prominence as long as the character is meaty enough because that's how soaps are made today. I also don't mind if I am given less work. But I am a very sensitive and creative person. I felt that there was no respect for a senior actor like me. Money is everywhere but one doesn't work only for money. If there is no respect for the work one does then money is not worth the effort.\nOn the last day of my shoot for Kasturi, I signed the register but didn't accept my pay-packet because I shot only for a few close-up shots. I didn't see any point in taking payment for only five minutes of work.\u2014\u2009Ganguly on quitting Ekta Kapoor's Kasturi[18]\nIn 2009, she appeared in Sekhar Das's Bengali film Kaaler Rakhal.[78] She appeared in Anjan Dutt's film Chowrasta the Crossroads of love (2009).[79]\n\n Ganguly receiving National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer for rendering her voice in Aditi Roy's Bengali film Abosheshey (2012)\nIn 2011, she won the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer for rendering her voice in Aditi Roy's Bengali film Abosheshey (2012)[80] where she also acted. In the film, she portrayed the character of Suchismita.[81] She appeared in Birsa Dasgupta's Jaani Dyakha Hawbe (2011), which after much commercial expectation proved to be a failure at the box office. She acted in Anurag Basu's blockbuster film Barfi! (2012). She acted in Anjan Dutt's Dutta Vs Dutta, (2012) where she played the character of \"Runu mashi\", who lives her life on her own terms and inspires the protagonist to live the life he desires.[82] She appeared in Riingo's Bengali film Na Hannyate (2012), where she played the character of Jui, who is caught in a situation where she could save only one of her kids and leave the other to die.[83] In 2013, she appeared in Utsav Mukherjee's hilarious social-satirical film Half Serious. She played the role of goddess Durga in the film. She appeared in Rana Basu's Bengali film Namte Namte (2013).[84]  She also appeared in Shekhar Das's Bengali film Nayanchampar Dinratri (2013).[85] In 2014, she appeared alongside Soumitra Chatterjee in Souvik Mitra's Bengali film Punascha, where she played the muse of an award-winning author, played by Chatterjee. The film earned her rave reviews including the statement made by The Times of India that the film belongs to her only.[86] In 2015, she acted in Debesh Chottopadhyay's Bengali film Natoker Moto and Aparna Sen's Bengali film Arshinagar. She will be seen in the role of a foul mouthed politician in an upcoming Hindi film Babumoshai Bandookbaaz, directed by Kushan Nandy.[87]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nIn 2015, Ganguly joined Bharatiya Janata Party ahead of 2016 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election and quit Artiste Forum since she believed that a political figure should not hold a significant designation in Artiste Forum.[88]\nIn West Bengal Assembly elections 2016, Ganguly lost from Howrah North to Trinamool Congress counterpart and cricketer Laxmi Ratan Shukla.[89]\nShe was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in October 2016 in place of cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu, who resigned earlier.[90][91][92]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nGanguly was married to Dhrubo Mukerjee, a mechanical engineer hailing from West Bengal, Kolkata from 1992 until 2007.[93] They have one child, a son, born in 1997, Aakash Mukherjee.[4][94] She was also in a live-in relationship with her singer companion, Dibyendu. The couple lived in Ganguly's Mumbai flat until the end of their relationship.[95][96]\n\nAwards and recognitions[edit]\nAwards[edit]\nGanguly had won numerous awards, including a National Award, Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards two times and Kalakar Awards three times. In 2011, she was awarded the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer for rendering her voice in Aditi Roy's Bengali film Abosheshey.[97] She was awarded for her husky and haunting voice in the songs Dure Kothay[98] and Aji Bijan Ghare.[99]\n\n\n\nAward\n\nYear\n\nCategory\n\nFilm\n\nTV series\n\nResult\n\nRef.\n\n\nNational Film Award\n\n2011\n\nBest Female Playback Singer\n\nAbosheshey\n\n\n\nWon\n\n[100]\n\n\nOsian's Cinefan Festival Award\n\n2005\n\nSpecial Jury Mention\n\nAntarmahal\n\n\n\nWon\n\n[29]\n\n\nBengal Film Journalists' Association Awards\n\n1996\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nUjan\n\n\n\nWon\n\n[101]\n\n\n2006\n\nAntarmahal\n\n\n\nWon\n\n[102]\n\n\nDhaka International Film Festival Award\n\n2006\n\nBest Actress\n\nKrantikaal\n\n\n\nWon\n\n[32]\n\n\nIndian Telly Award\n\n2009\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\n\n\nAgle Janam Mohe Bitiya Hi Kijo\n\nNominated\n\n[103]\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\nNominated\n\n[104]\n\n\nSmita Patil Memorial Award\n\n1989\n\nBest Actress\n\n\n\nMahabharat\n\nWon\n\n[105][19]\n\n\nAnandalok Puraskar\n\n2005\n\nBest Actress\n\nNagordola\n\n\n\nNominated\n\n\n\n\nKalakar Awards\n\n1993\n\nBest Actress\n\n\n\nMukta Bandha\n\nWon\n\n[106]\n\n\n1998\n\nYugant\n\n\n\nWon\n\n[106]\n\n\n2002\n\n\n\nIngeet\n\nWon\n\n[106]\n\n\nAajkaal Television Purashkar\n\n1990\n\nSpecial Felicitation\n\n\n\nMahabharat\n\nWon\n\n\n\nRecognition[edit]\nSocial and cultural anthropologist Purnima Mankekar's ethnography of television-viewing in India, Screening Culture, Viewing Politics: An Ethnography of Television, Womanhood, and Nation in Postcolonial India, published by Duke University Press in 1999, features a still shot of Ganguly as Draupadi on its cover.[107][108]\nFilmography[edit]\n\nKey\n\n\n\n\nDenotes films that have not yet been released\n\nEnglish films[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nDirector\n\nNotes\n\nRef.\n\n\n2004\n\nBow Barracks Forever\n\nAnjan Dutt\n\n\n\n[109]\n\n\n2012\n\nChaurahen\n\nRajshree Ojha\n\n\n\n\n\nHindi films[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nDirector\n\nNotes\n\nRef.\n\n\n1986\n\nNirupama\n\nBijoy Chatterjee\n\nShort film based on Rabindranath Tagore's Bengali short story Dena Paona\n\n[3]\n\n\nStree Ki Patra\n\nSoumitra Chatterjee\n\nTelefilm\n\n[38]\n\n\n1989\n\nEk Din Achanak\n\nMrinal Sen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKamla Ki Maut\n\nBasu Chatterjee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1990\n\nBahaar Aane Tak\n\nTariq Shah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1991\n\nInspector Dhanush\n\nTulsi RamsayShyam Ramsay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeena Bazar\n\nP.
