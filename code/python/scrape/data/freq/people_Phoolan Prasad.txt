He is also a Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy (INSA).[1]\n Prasad studied in Nalhati HP High School, Krishnath College Berhampore, received his  B.Sc. from the Presidency College, Calcutta University and M.Sc. from Rajabazar Science College campus of Calcutta University followed by a Ph.D. from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore in  1968.[1]\n Prasad started his career as a lecturer in the Department of Applied Mathematics in 1967 at Indian Institute of Science, thereafter he became a Professor in 1977.
