Together with J.-P. Serre he is one of the cofounders of the theory of cohomological invariants of linear algebraic groups. He has also made numerous contributions to the theory of torsors, quadratic forms, central simple algebras, Jordan algebras (the Rost-Serre invariant), exceptional groups, and essential dimension.[citation needed] Most of his results are  available only on his webpage.\n In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[1]\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "21st-century German mathematicians", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from August 2017", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Year of birth missing (living people)"], "raw": "Markus Rost is a German mathematician who works at the intersection of topology and algebra.
