{"name": "Shirley McBay", "content": "Dr. Shirley Mathis McBay (born May 4, 1935, Bainbridge, Georgia) is the founder and former president of the Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit dedicated to improving minority education.[1] She was the Dean for Student Affairs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1980 to 1990.[2] She was the first African-American to receive a PhD from the University of Georgia (1966, Mathematics).[3] McBay is recognized by Mathematically Gifted & Black as a Black History Month 2017 Honoree.[4]\n McBay received a BA in chemistry from Paine College in 1954, graduating summa cum laude. While also teaching chemistry at Spelman College, McBay earned an MS in chemistry (1957) and MS in mathematics (1958) from Atlanta University.[5] In 1964, she earned a United Negro College Fund Fellowship, sponsored by the IBM Corporation, that allowed her to study at the University of Georgia and earn a PhD in mathematics in 1966.[6][5] Her PhD was advised by Thomas Roy Brahana with a dissertation on The Homology Theory of Metabelian Lie Algebras.[7]\n McBay spent 15 years at Spelman College as a faculty member and administrator. McBay's leadership at Spelman led to the creation of the Division of Natural Sciences and an increase in an emphasis on the sciences at the institution.[5] She served as chairman of the division until 1975 and as Associate Academic Dean at Spelman from 1973-1975.[5] During this time, she created pre-freshman summer programs to increase interest in science majors, which led to the creation of a chemistry department and renovations of existing science buildings.[5]\n McBay left Spelman in 1975 and took a position at the National Science Foundation for 5 years.[1][5] While at the National Science Foundation, she became program director of the Minority Institutions Science Improvement Program.[5] She then worked for 10 years at MIT as the Dean for Student Affairs. 30 months of this time included being the director of the QEM Project, a study of minority education problems. The QEM Project was the impetus for the Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network which McBay founded and was president of from 1990 to 2016.[2][1]\n ", "tags": ["1935 births", "Living people", "American nonprofit chief executives", "Women nonprofit executives", "Spelman College faculty", "20th-century American mathematicians", "University of Georgia alumni", "Atlanta University alumni", "Paine College alumni", "American women chief executives", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Mathematician\nDr. Shirley Mathis McBay (born May 4, 1935, Bainbridge, Georgia) is the founder and former president of the Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit dedicated to improving minority education.[1] She was the Dean for Student Affairs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1980 to 1990.[2] She was the first African-American to receive a PhD from the University of Georgia (1966, Mathematics).[3] McBay is recognized by Mathematically Gifted & Black as a Black History Month 2017 Honoree.[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Education\n2 Career\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nEducation[edit]\nMcBay received a BA in chemistry from Paine College in 1954, graduating summa cum laude.
