{"name": "H.

He married Faith Griswold Thompson.\n In his early career, Severance worked for Carrere and Hastings and later, in partnership with William Van Alen.[1]  The partnership ended on unfriendly terms, and in the late 1920s, the two found themselves in competition to build the world's tallest building, with Severance's 40 Wall Street and Van Alen's Chrysler Building.  Although the Chrysler Building claimed victory with its spire at 1,046 feet, Severance protested that his building had the highest usable space.  The issue became moot when the Empire State Building was completed less than a year later.\n He died on 2 September 1941.[1]\n ", "tags": ["1879 births", "1941 deaths", "American architects", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American architect\nH.
