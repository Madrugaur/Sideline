{"name": "Hans Poelzig", "content": "Gro\u00dfes Schauspielhaus\n League of Nations\n Hans Poelzig (30 April 1869 \u2013 14 June 1936) was a German architect, painter and set designer.\n Poelzig was born in Berlin in 1869 to Countess Clara Henrietta Maria Poelzig (daughter of Alexander von Hanstein, Count of P\u00f6lzig and Beiersdorf) while she was married to George Acland Ames, an Englishman. Uncertain of his paternity, Ames refused to acknowledge Hans as his son and consequently he was brought up by a local choirmaster and his wife. In 1899 he married Maria Voss with whom they had four children.[1]\n Hans Poelzig was buried in the Old Cemetery in Berlin-Wannsee.\n On 18 November 2015, Friedrichstadt-Palast Berlin inaugurated a memorial at Friedrichstra\u00dfe 107 dedicated to the theatre's founders, Max Reinhardt, Hans Poelzig and Erik Charell. \n In 1903 he became a teacher and director at the Breslau Academy of Art and Design (Kunst- und Gewerbeschule Breslau; today  Wroc\u0142aw, Poland). From 1920-1935 he taught at the Technical University of Berlin (Technische Hochschule Berlin).\nDirector of the Architecture Department of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin.\n After finishing his architectural education around the turn of the century, Poelzig designed many industrial buildings. He designed the 51.2\u00a0m tall Upper Silesia Tower in Posen (today Pozna\u0144) for an industrial fair in 1911. It later became a water tower. He was appointed city architect of Dresden in 1916. He was an influential member of the Deutscher Werkbund.\n Poelzig was also known for his distinctive 1919 interior redesign of the Berlin Grosses Schauspielhaus for Weimar impresario Max Reinhardt, and for his vast architectural set designs for the 1920 UFA film production of The Golem: How He Came Into the World. (Poelzig mentored Edgar Ulmer on that film; when Ulmer directed the 1934 film noir Universal Studios production of The Black Cat, he returned the favor by naming the architect-Satanic-high-priest villain character \"Hjalmar Poelzig\", played by Boris Karloff.)\n With his Weimar architect contemporaries like Bruno Taut and Ernst May, Poelzig's work developed through Expressionism and the New Objectivity in the mid-1920s before arriving at a more conventional, economical style. In 1927 he was one of the exhibitors in the first International Style project, the Weissenhof Estate in Stuttgart. In the 1920s he ran the \"Studio Poelzig\" in partnership with his wife Marlene (Nee Moeschke) (1894\u20131985). Poelzig also designed the 1929 Broadcasting House in the Berlin suburb of Charlottenburg, a landmark of architecture, and Cold War and engineering history.\n Poelzig's single best-known building is the enormous and legendary I.G. Farben Building, completed in 1931 as the administration building for IG Farben in Frankfurt am Main, now known as the Poelzig Building at Goethe University. In March 1945 the building was occupied by American Allied forces under Eisenhower, became his headquarters, and remained in American hands until 1995. Some of his designs that were never built included one for the Palace of the Soviets and one for the League of Nations headquarters at Geneva.\n In 1933 Poelzig served as the interim director of the Vereinigte Staatsschulen f\u00fcr freie und angewandete Kunst (United State School for Fine and Applied Art), after the expulsion of founding director Bruno Paul by the National Socialists.  Poelzig died in Berlin in June 1936, shortly before his planned departure for Ankara.\n ", "tags": ["1869 births", "1936 deaths", "19th-century German architects", "Expressionist architects", "Modernist architects", "Architecture educators", "Artists from Berlin", "People from the Province of Brandenburg", "Prussian Academy of Arts faculty", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Hans PoelzigHans Poelzig (1927)Born(1869-04-30)30 April 1869BerlinDied14 June 1936(1936-06-14) (aged\u00a067)BerlinNationalityGermanOccupationArchitectBuildingsI.G.
