After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, he defected to America, settled in San Francisco, and found employment in the management science department of Wells Fargo Bank in January 1969. In 1989 Stephen Kealhofer, John McQuown and Old\u0159ich Va\u0161\u00ed\u010dek founded company KMV. In 2002 the three entrepreneurs sold the company to Moody's for $210 million.[1] In 2007, Moody's KMV was renamed to Moody's Analytics.[2]\n In 1970, Wells Fargo sponsored a conference that included Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, who had just begun thinking seriously about the problem of valuing stock options. Of course, their paper on that subject, timed so as to coincide with a related paper by Robert C. Merton, would revolutionize financial economics three years later. Even their preliminary thoughts at the 1970 conference excited Va\u0161\u00ed\u010dek, who soon made related issues his own life's work.\n Va\u0161\u00ed\u010dek's own breakthrough paper, \"An equilibrium characterization of the term structure\" [3] describing the dynamics of the yield curve, appeared in the Journal of Financial Economics in 1977. The mean-reverting short-rate model he describes is commonly known as the Vasicek model. In recognition of that paper, and subsequent work, the International Association of Financial Engineers named Va\u0161\u00ed\u010dek its IAFE/Sungard Financial Engineer of the Year, in 2004.\n Va\u0161\u00ed\u010dek has also received the Risk magazine Lifetime Achievement Award.
