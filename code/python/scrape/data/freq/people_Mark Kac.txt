{"name": "Mark Kac", "content": "Mark Kac (/k\u0251\u02d0ts/ KAHTS; Polish: Marek Kac; August 3, 1914 \u2013 October 26, 1984) was a Polish American mathematician. His main interest was probability theory. His question, \"Can one hear the shape of a drum?\" set off research into spectral theory, with the idea of understanding the extent to which the spectrum allows one to read back the geometry. (In the end, the answer was \"no\", in general.)\n He was born to a Polish-Jewish family; their town, Kremenets (Polish: \"Krzemieniec\"), changed hands from the Russian Empire to Poland when Kac was a child.[1]\n Kac completed his Ph.D. in mathematics at the Polish University of Lw\u00f3w in 1937 under the direction of Hugo Steinhaus.[2] While there, he was a member of the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics. After receiving his degree he began to look for a position abroad, and in 1938 was granted a scholarship from the Parnas Foundation which enabled him to go work in the United States. He arrived in New York City in November, 1938.[3]\n With the onset of World War II, Kac was able to stay in America, while his parents and brother who remained in Krzemieniec were murdered by the Germans in mass executions in August 1942.[4]\n From 1939\u201361 he was at Cornell University, first as an instructor, then from 1943 as assistant professor and from 1947 as full professor.[5] While there, he became a naturalized US citizen in 1943. In the academic year 1951\u20131952 Kac was on sabbatical at the Institute for Advanced Study.[6] In 1952, Kac, with Theodore H. Berlin, introduced the spherical model of a ferromagnet (a variant of the Ising model)[7] and, with J. C. Ward, found an exact solution of the Ising model using a combinatorial method.[8] In 1961 he left Cornell and went to The Rockefeller University in New York City. In the early 1960s he worked with George Uhlenbeck and P. C. Hemmer on the mathematics of a van der Waals gas.[9] After twenty years at Rockefeller, he moved to the University of Southern California where he spent the rest of his career.\n In his 1966 article with the title \"Can one hear the shape of the drum\" Kac asked the question whether two resonators (\"drums\") of different geometrical shapes can have exactly the same set of frequencies (\"sound tones\"). The answer was positive, meaning that the eigenfrequency set does not uniquely characterize the shape of a resonator.\n ", "tags": ["1914 births", "1984 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Cornell University faculty", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Polish emigrants to the United States", "American people of Polish-Jewish descent", "Presidents of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics", "Probability theorists", "Polish mathematicians", "Polish people of Jewish descent", "University of Southern California faculty", "People with acquired American citizenship", "People from Kremenets", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1: long volume value", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Articles needing additional references from October 2016", "All articles needing additional references", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BPN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Mark KacBorn(1914-08-03)August 3, 1914KrzemieniecDiedOctober 26, 1984(1984-10-26) (aged\u00a070)CaliforniaNationalityPolishCitizenshipPoland, USAAlma\u00a0materLw\u00f3w UniversityKnown\u00a0forFeynman\u2013Kac formulaErd\u0151s\u2013Kac theoremKac\u2013Bernstein theoremKac's lemmaKac processAwardsChauvenet Prize (1950, 1968)Birkhoff Prize (1978)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsCornell UniversityRockefeller UniversityUniversity of Southern CaliforniaDoctoral advisorHugo SteinhausDoctoral studentsHarry KestenWilliam LeVequeWilliam NewcombLonnie CrossDaniel B.

The answer was positive, meaning that the eigenfrequency set does not uniquely characterize the shape of a resonator.\n\nReminiscences[edit]\nThis section does not cite any sources.

(October 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nHis definition of a profound truth. \"A truth is a statement whose negation is false. A profound truth is a truth whose negation is also a profound truth.\" (Also attributed to Niels Bohr)\nHe preferred to work on results that were robust, meaning that they were true under many different assumptions and not the accidental consequence of a set of axioms.\nOften Kac's \"proofs\" consisted of a series of worked examples that illustrated the important cases.\nWhen Kac and Richard Feynman were both Cornell faculty, Kac attended a lecture of Feynman's and remarked that the two of them were working on the same thing from different directions. The Feynman\u2013Kac formula resulted, which proves rigorously the real case of Feynman's path integrals. The complex case, which occurs when a particle's spin is included, is still unproven. Kac had learned Wiener processes by reading Norbert Wiener's original papers, which were \"the most difficult papers I have ever read.\"[3] Brownian motion is a Wiener process. Feynman's path integrals are another example.\nKac's distinction between an \"ordinary genius\" like Hans Bethe and a \"magician\" like Richard Feynman has been widely quoted. (Bethe was also at Cornell University.)\nKac became interested in the occurrence of statistical independence without randomness. As an example of this, he gave a lecture on the average number of factors that a random integer has. This wasn't really random in the strictest sense of the word, because it refers to the average number of prime divisors of the integers up to N as N goes to infinity, which is predetermined. He could see that the answer was c log log N, if you assumed that the number of prime divisors of two numbers x and y were independent, but he was unable to provide a complete proof of independence. Paul Erd\u0151s was in the audience and soon finished the proof using sieve theory, and the result became known as the Erd\u0151s\u2013Kac theorem. They continued working together and more or less created the subject of  probabilistic number theory.\nKac sent Erd\u0151s a list of his publications, and one of his papers contained the word \"capacitor\" in the title. Erd\u0151s wrote back to him \"I pray for your soul.\"\nAwards and honors[edit]\n1950 \u2014 Chauvenet Prize for 1947 expository article[10]\n1959 \u2013 member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\n1965 \u2013 member of the National Academy of Sciences\n1968 \u2013 Chauvenet Prize (and 1967 Lester R.
