Miles may have resided in the nearby town of Chillicothe, Ohio,[4] but subsequently moved to Waukesha, Wisconsin, where he earned a living as a barber.[5] After a move to Winona, Minnesota, he met and married Mrs. Candace J. (Shedd) Dunlap, of La Porte, Indiana,[6] a widow with two children, who was four years his senior and a native of New York.[7] Together they had a daughter, born in 1876, named Grace.

Miles improved on this mechanism by designing a flexible belt attachment to the elevator cage, and drums positioned to indicate if the elevator has reached a floor. The belt allowed for automatic opening and closing when the elevator reached the drums on the respective floors, by means of levers and rollers.[16]\n Miles was granted a patent for this mechanism in 1887, thus greatly improving the safety and efficiency of elevators.[17] John W.
