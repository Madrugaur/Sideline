{"name": "Herbert Kroemer", "content": "Herbert Kroemer (born August 25, 1928) is a German-American physicist who, along with Zhores Alferov, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000 for \"developing semiconductor heterostructures used in high-speed- and opto-electronics\". Kroemer is professor emeritus of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara, having received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1952 from the University of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, with a dissertation on hot electron effects in the then-new transistor. His research into transistors was a stepping stone to the later development of mobile phone technologies.\n Kroemer worked in a number of research laboratories in Germany and the United States and taught electrical engineering at the University of Colorado from 1968 to 1976. He joined the UCSB faculty in 1976, focusing its semiconductor research program on the emerging compound semiconductor technology rather than on mainstream silicon technology. Along with Charles Kittel he co-authored the textbook Thermal Physics, first published in 1980, and still used today.[citation needed]  He is also the author of the textbook Quantum Mechanics for Engineering, Materials Science and Applied Physics.[2]\nKroemer was later elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1997 and the National Academy of Sciences in 2003. \n He always preferred to work on problems that are ahead of mainstream technology, inventing the drift transistor in the 1950s and being the first to point out that advantages could be gained in various semiconductor devices by incorporating heterojunctions. Most notably, though, in 1963 he proposed the concept of the double-heterostructure laser, which is now a central concept in the field of semiconductor lasers. Kroemer became an early pioneer in molecular beam epitaxy, concentrating on applying the technology to untried new materials.[citation needed]\n Born to a working-class family in Weimar, Kroemer excelled in his physics schooling such that he was dismissed from having to do much of the coursework.[3] He is an atheist.[4]\n ", "tags": ["1928 births", "Living people", "Engineering educators", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "German atheists", "German Nobel laureates", "American Nobel laureates", "German physicists", "IEEE Medal of Honor recipients", "Nobel laureates in Physics", "Semiconductor physicists", "University of California, Santa Barbara faculty", "University of Colorado faculty", "People from Weimar", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering", "Fellow Members of the IEEE", "Fellows of the American Physical Society", "Alexander von Humboldt Fellows", "University of Jena alumni", "Grand Crosses with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "German emigrants to the United States", "BLP articles lacking sources from February 2013", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from April 2020", "Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.
