{"name": "Daina Taimi\u0146a", "content": "Daina Taimi\u0146a (born August 19, 1954)[1] is a Latvian mathematician, retired adjunct associate professor of mathematics at Cornell University, known for crocheting objects to illustrate hyperbolic space and innovative use of them teaching geometry.\n Taimi\u0146a received all of her formal education in Riga, Latvia, where in 1977 she graduated summa cum laude from the University of Latvia and completed her graduate work in Theoretical Computer Science (with thesis advisor Prof. R\u016bsi\u0146\u0161 M\u0101rti\u0146\u0161 Freivalds) in 1990. As one of the restrictions of Soviet system at that time, a doctoral thesis was not allowed to be defended in Latvia, so she defended hers in Minsk, receiving the title of Candidate of Sciences. This explains the fact that Taimi\u0146a's doctorate was formally issued by the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. After Latvia regained independence in 1991, Taimi\u0146a received her higher doctoral degree (doktor nauk) in mathematics from the University of Latvia, where she taught for 20 years.[2]\n Daina Taimi\u0146a joined the Cornell Math Department in December 1996.\n While attending a geometry workshop in 1997, she saw fragile paper models of hyperbolic planes, designed by geometer William Thurston.[3] She decided to make more durable models, and did so by crocheting them.[3] Together with her husband David Henderson, a math professor also at Cornell, she led several workshops at  Cornell for college geometry instructors.[4]\nCrocheted mathematical models later appeared in three geometry textbooks they wrote together, of which the most popular is Experiencing Geometry: Euclidean and non-Euclidean with History. In 2020 Taimina published 4th edition of this book as open source [https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bia/1598805354]\n An article about Taimi\u0146a's innovation in New Scientist was spotted by the Institute For Figuring, a small non-profit organisation based in Los Angeles, and she was invited to speak about hyperbolic space and its connections with nature to a general audience  which included artists and movie producers.[4] Taimi\u0146a's initial lecture and following other public presentations sparked great interest in this new tactile way of exploring concepts of hyperbolic geometry, making this advanced topic accessible to wide audiences. Originally creating purely mathematical models, Taimi\u0146a soon became popular as a fiber artist and public presenter for general audiences of ages five and up. In June 2005, her work was first shown as art in an exhibition \"Not The Knitting You Know\" at Eleven Eleven Sculpture Space, an art gallery in Washington, D.C. [5]  Since then she has participated regularly in various shows in galleries in US, UK, Latvia, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Germany.  Her artwork is in the collections of several private collectors, colleges and universities, and has been included in the American Mathematical Model Collection of the Smithsonian Museum, Cooper\u2013Hewitt, National Design Museum, and Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9.\n Her work has received wide interest in media.  It has been written about in 'Knit Theory' in Discover magazine[6] and in The Times,[7] explaining how a hyperbolic plane can be crocheted by increasing the number of stitches:\n For example, adding an extra stitch in the second line for every five stitches in the first. And for every five stitches in the second line, adding an extra one in the third. The number of stitches increases at an exponential rate. As the lines are longer, but joined together, the material quickly starts to fold in interesting ways. Margaret Wertheim interviewed Daina Taimi\u0146a and David Henderson for Cabinet Magazine [8]\nLater, based on Taimina's work, the Institute For Figuring published a brochure \"A Field Guide to Hyperbolic Space\". In 2005 the IFF decided to incorporate Taimi\u0146a's ideas and approach of explaining hyperbolic space in their mission of popularizing mathematics, and curated an exhibition at Machine Project gallery, which was the subject of a piece in the Los Angeles Times.[9]\nTaimi\u0146a's way of exploring hyperbolic space via crochet and connections with nature, combatting math phobia, was adapted by Margaret Wertheim in her talks[10] and became highly successful in the IFF-curated Hyperbolic Crochet Coral Reef project.[11]\n Taimi\u0146a's book \"Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes\" (A K Peters, Ltd., 2009, ISBN\u00a0978-1-56881-452-0)[12] won the 2009 Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year.[13]\nIt also won the 2012 Euler Book Prize of the Mathematical Association of America.[14]\n Taimi\u0146a also contributed to David W.
