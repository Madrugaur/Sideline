In 2009, he was appointed to Professor at the Mathematics Institute at the Hebrew University.\n Lindenstrauss was born into an Israeli-Jewish family with German Jewish origins. He was also born into a mathematical family, the son of the mathematician Joram Lindenstrauss, the namesake of the Johnson\u2013Lindenstrauss lemma, and computer scientist Naomi Lindenstrauss, both professors at the Hebrew University. His sister Ayelet Lindenstrauss is also a mathematician. He attended the Hebrew University Secondary School. In 1988 he was awarded a bronze medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad.  He enlisted to the IDF's Talpiot program, and studied at the Hebrew University, where he earned his BSc in Mathematics and Physics in 1991 and his master's degree in Mathematics in 1995. In 1999 he finished his Ph.D., his thesis being \"Entropy properties of dynamical systems\", under the guidance of Prof. Benjamin Weiss. He was a member at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, then a Szego Assistant Prof. at Stanford University. From 2003 to 2005, he was a Long Term Prize Fellow at the Clay Mathematics Institute.\n In Fall 2014, he was Visiting Miller Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.[3]\n Lindenstrauss works in the area of dynamics, particularly in the area of ergodic theory and its applications in number theory. With Anatole Katok and Manfred Einsiedler, he made progress on the Littlewood conjecture.\n In a series of two papers (one co-authored with Jean Bourgain) he made major progress on Peter Sarnak's Arithmetic Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture. The proof of the conjecture was completed by Kannan Soundararajan.\n Recently with Manfred Einsiedler, Philippe Michel and Akshay Venkatesh, he studied distributions of torus periodic orbits in some arithmetic spaces, generalizing theorems by Hermann Minkowski and Yuri Linnik.\n Together with Benjamin Weiss he developed and studied systematically the invariant of mean dimension introduced in 1999 by Mikhail Gromov.
