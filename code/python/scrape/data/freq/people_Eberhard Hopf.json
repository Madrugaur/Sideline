{"name": "Eberhard Hopf", "content": "Eberhard Frederich Ferdinand Hopf (April 17, 1902 in Salzburg, Austria-Hungary \u2013 July 24, 1983 in Bloomington, Indiana, USA) was a mathematician and astronomer, one of the founding fathers of ergodic theory and a pioneer of bifurcation theory who also made significant contributions to the subjects of partial differential equations and integral equations, fluid dynamics, and differential geometry. The Hopf maximum principle is an early result of his (1927) that is one of the most important techniques in the theory of elliptic partial differential equations.\n Eberhard Hopf was born in Salzburg, Austria-Hungary, but his scientific career was divided between Germany and the United States. He received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1926 and his Habilitation in mathematical astronomy from the University of Berlin in 1929.\n In 1930, he received a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation to study classical mechanics with George Birkhoff at Harvard, but his appointment was at the Harvard College Observatory. In late 1931, with the help of Norbert Wiener, Hopf joined the Department of Mathematics of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, accepting the position of assistant professor. While at MIT, Hopf did much of his work on ergodic theory.\n In Cambridge Hopf worked on many mathematical and astronomical subjects. His paper \"On the Time Average Theorem in Dynamics\",[1] which appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is considered by many to be the first readable paper in modern ergodic theory. His book Mathematical problems of radiative equilibrium first appeared in 1934 and was reprinted in 1964. Another important contribution from this period is the theory of Wiener-Hopf equations, which he developed in collaboration with Norbert Wiener. By 1960, a discrete version of these equations was being extensively used in electrical engineering and geophysics, their use continuing until the present day. During this time, Hopf gained a reputation for his ability to illuminate the most complex subjects for his colleagues and even for non-specialists. Because of this talent, many discoveries and proofs of other mathematicians became easier to understand after they had been described by Hopf.\n In 1936, Hopf received and accepted an offer of a full professorship from the University of Leipzig. With his wife Ilse and their infant daughter Barbara, he returned to Germany, which by this time was under the control of the Nazi Party.\n The book Ergodentheorie, most of which was written when Hopf was still at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was published in 1937. In that book, containing only 81 pages, Hopf presented a precise and elegant summary of ergodic theory. In 1939, he established ergodicity of the geodesic flow on compact manifolds of constant negative curvature. In 1940, he was on the list of invited lecturers to the International Congress of Mathematicians to be held in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Because of the start of World War II, however, the Congress was cancelled.\n In 1942, Hopf was drafted to work in the German Aeronautical Institute. In 1944, a year before the end of World War II, he was appointed to a professorship at the University of Munich.\n On 22 February 1949, Hopf became a US citizen and joined Indiana University at Bloomington as a professor of mathematics. In 1962, he was made Research Professor of Mathematics, staying in that position until his death.\n Hopf was never forgiven by many people for moving back to Germany in 1936, when the Nazi party was in power. As a result, most of his work in ergodic theory and topology was neglected or even attributed to others in the years following the end of World War II.[citation needed] An example of this was the expulsion of Hopf's name from the discrete version of the Wiener\u2013Hopf equations, which were frequently referred to as \"Wiener filter\".\n In 1971, Hopf was the American Mathematical Society Gibbs Lecturer.[2] In 1981, he received the Leroy P. Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society for seminal contributions to research.\n \n ", "tags": ["1902 births", "1983 deaths", "Scientists from Salzburg", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Topologists", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from August 2018", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\nEberhard HopfBorn(1902-04-17)17 April 1902Salzburg, Austria-HungaryDied24 July 1983(1983-07-24) (aged\u00a081)Bloomington, Indiana, United StatesNationalityGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of BerlinKnown\u00a0forErgodic theoryPartial differential equationDifferential geometryScientific careerFieldsMathematicianInstitutionsMIT (1931-36)University of Leipzig (1936-42)University of Munich (1944-47)Indiana Univ.
