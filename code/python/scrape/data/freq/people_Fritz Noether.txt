{"name": "Fritz Noether", "content": "Fritz Alexander Ernst Noether (7\u00a0October 1884 \u2013 10\u00a0September 1941) was a famous German mathematician who emigrated from Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union. He was later executed by the Stalinist NKVD.[2]\n Fritz Noether's father Max Noether was a mathematician and professor in Erlangen. The notable mathematician Emmy Noether was his elder sister. He had two sons, Herman D. Noether and Gottfried E. Noether. His eldest son Herman was a chemist.

Not allowed to work in Nazi Germany for being a Jew, he moved to the Soviet Union, where he was appointed to a professorship at the Tomsk State University.\n In November\u00a01937, during the Great Purge, he was arrested at his home in Tomsk by the NKVD. On 23\u00a0October 1938, Noether was sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment on charges of espionage and sabotage. He served time in different prisons. On 8\u00a0September 1941 the Military Collegium of the USSR Supreme Court sentenced Professor F. Noether to death on the accusation of \"anti-Soviet propaganda\".
