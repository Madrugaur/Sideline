This was a forerunner to Simon Stevin, the first to widely distribute publications on this topic, and employed decimal notation for integers, fractions, and both positive and negative exponents.[2][6][7]\n While living in Tarascon in 1365, Bonfils published the work for which he would become best known, Sepher Shesh Kenaphayim (Book of Six Wings) (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05e9 \u05db\u05e0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd\u200e), a manuscript on eclipses that featured astronomical tables predicting future solar and lunar positions (divided into six parts).[1][8] The book included data for every important date on the Jewish calendar and even correction factors necessary for those who lived as far away as Constantinople.[6]  Breaking the tables into six parts was an allusion to the six wings of the seraphim as mentioned in the Bible in Isaiah 6:2, earning Bonfils the nickname master of the wings.[1]\n For 300 years, Bonfils' calculations which were extensively used by sailors and explorers well into the 17th century.[5] The book was translated from Hebrew into Latin in 1406 by Johannes Lucae e Camerino and into Greek in 1435 by Michael Chrysokokkes. The book inspired Chemist George Sarton to publish his own version of Six Wings nearly 600 years later.[1] Bonfils translated a number of books from Latin to Hebrew.
