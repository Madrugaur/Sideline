{"name": "Alina Bucur", "content": "Alina Ioana Bucur is a Romanian-born mathematician and an associate professor of mathematics at the University of California, San Diego. Bucur's research is in analytic number theory with an emphasis on arithmetic statistics.\n After completing her undergraduate studies at the University of Bucharest in 2001,[1] she pursued her graduate studies at Brown University, where she received her Ph.D. in 2006; her dissertation was supervised by Jeffrey Ezra Hoffstein.[2]. After completion of her degree, Bucur was a member of the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey from 2006\u20132007 and 2009\u20132010[1] and a C. L. E. Moore Instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 2006\u20132009.  She came to the University of California, San Diego, in 2009 as an assistant professor and was granted tenure and promoted to associate professor in 2016.[3] Bucur returned to the Institute for Advanced Study as a von Neumann Fellow of the School of Mathematics from 2018\u20132019.[1]\n Bucur has been involved in Women in Numbers (WIN) Network, a professional network for women with research interests in number theory, since its inception.
