When war broke out in 1914, he was instrumental in organising a society known as the Society of Good Samaritans. The idea was to train Russian students to take care of the wounded. It also had a special recognition from Tsar Nicholas II. He was against violence of any sort despite having a leading position in tsarist arms production.\n After the Russian Revolutions of 1917, Trachtenberg fled to the Weimar Republic where he became critical of Nazi policies.
