After leaving school he joined Hertfordshire Rangers to concentrate on \"soccer\". He represented both Middlesex and Kent during his career, as well as making occasional appearances for Westminster School and Wanderers.\n He was selected to play in goal for England's first ever international match against Scotland on 30 November 1872. The original selection for goalkeeper, Alexander Morten, was unavailable and, according to Graham Betts in \"England \u2013 Player by player\", \"Barker was chosen (to play in goal) because he was the biggest and slowest player in the England team and because his rugby experience and handling of the ball would come in useful\"[2] Barker kept a clean sheet for the first half and at some point in the game he switched places with William Maynard. At 25 years, 165 days Barker was the oldest player in the England line-up.\n As he was in goal and therefore first in the lineup for England's first international match, Barker officially has legacy number 1 for England.
