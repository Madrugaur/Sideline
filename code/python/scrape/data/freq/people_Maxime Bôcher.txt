{"name": "Maxime B\u00f4cher", "content": "Maxime B\u00f4cher (August 28, 1867 \u2013 September 12, 1918) was an American mathematician who published about 100 papers on differential equations, series, and algebra.[1] He also wrote elementary texts such as Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry.[2] B\u00f4cher's theorem, B\u00f4cher's equation, and the B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize are named after him.\n B\u00f4cher was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents were Caroline Little and Ferdinand B\u00f4cher. Maxime's father was professor of modern languages at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when Maxime was born, and became Professor of French at Harvard University in 1872.\n B\u00f4cher received an excellent education from his parents and from a number of public and private schools in Massachusetts. He graduated from the Cambridge Latin School in 1883. He received his first degree from Harvard in 1888. At Harvard, he studied a wide range of topics, including mathematics, Latin, chemistry, philosophy, zoology, geography, geology, meteorology, Roman art, and music.\n B\u00f4cher was awarded many prestigious prizes, which allowed him to travel to Europe to do research. The University of G\u00f6ttingen was then the leading mathematics university, and he attended there lectures by Felix Klein, Arthur Moritz Schoenflies, Hermann Schwarz, Issai Schur and Woldemar Voigt. He was awarded a doctorate in 1891 for his dissertation \u00dcber die Reihenentwicklungen der Potentialtheorie (German for \"On the Development of the Potential Function into Series\"); he was encouraged to study this topic by Klein. He received a G\u00f6ttingen university prize for this work.\n In G\u00f6ttingen he met Marie Niemann, and they were married in July 1891. They had three children, Helen, Esther, and Frederick. He returned with his wife to Harvard where he was appointed as an instructor. In 1894 he was promoted to assistant professor, due to his impressive record. He became a full professor of mathematics in 1904. He was president of the American Mathematical Society from 1908 to 1910.[3]\n Although he was only 46 years old, there were already signs that his weak health was failing.
