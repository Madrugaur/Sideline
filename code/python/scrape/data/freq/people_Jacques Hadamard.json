{"name": "Jacques Hadamard", "content": "\n Jacques Salomon Hadamard ForMemRS[2] (French:\u00a0[adama\u0281]; 8 December 1865 \u2013 17 October 1963) was a French mathematician who made major contributions in number theory, complex analysis, differential geometry and partial differential equations.[3][4][5]\n The son of a teacher, Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Hadamard, of Jewish descent, and Claire Marie Jeanne Picard, Hadamard was born in Versailles, France and attended the Lyc\u00e9e Charlemagne and Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand, where his father taught. In 1884 Hadamard entered the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, having placed first in the entrance examinations both there and at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. His teachers included Tannery, Hermite, Darboux, Appell, Goursat and Picard. He obtained his doctorate in 1892 and in the same year was awarded the Grand Prix des Sciences Math\u00e9matiques for his essay on the Riemann zeta function.\n In 1892 Hadamard married Louise-Anna Tr\u00e9nel, also of Jewish descent, with whom he had three sons and two daughters. The following year he took up a lectureship in the University of Bordeaux, where he proved his celebrated inequality on determinants, which led to the discovery of Hadamard matrices when equality holds. In 1896 he made two important contributions: he proved the prime number theorem, using complex function theory (also proved independently by Charles Jean de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin); and he was awarded the Bordin Prize of the French Academy of Sciences for his work on geodesics in the differential geometry of surfaces and dynamical systems. In the same year he was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Rational Mechanics in Bordeaux. His foundational work on geometry and symbolic dynamics continued in 1898 with the study of geodesics on surfaces of negative curvature. For his cumulative work, he was awarded the Prix Poncelet in 1898.\n After the Dreyfus affair, which involved him personally because his second cousin Lucie was the wife of Dreyfus, Hadamard became politically active and a staunch supporter of Jewish causes[6][failed verification] though he professed to be an atheist in his religion.[7][8]\n In 1897 he moved back to Paris, holding positions in the Sorbonne and the Coll\u00e8ge de France, where he was appointed Professor of Mechanics in 1909. In addition to this post, he was appointed to chairs of analysis at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1912 and at the \u00c9cole Centrale in 1920, succeeding Jordan and Appell. In Paris Hadamard concentrated his interests on the problems of mathematical physics, in particular partial differential equations, the calculus of variations and the foundations of functional analysis. He introduced the idea of well-posed problem and the method of descent in the theory of partial differential equations, culminating in his seminal book on the subject, based on lectures given at Yale University in 1922. Later in his life he wrote on probability theory and mathematical education.\n Hadamard was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1916, in succession to Poincar\u00e9, whose complete works he helped edit. He became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1920.[9] He was elected a foreign member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1929. He visited the Soviet Union in 1930 and 1934 and China in 1936 at the invitation of Soviet and Chinese mathematicians.\n Hadamard stayed in France at the beginning of the Second World War and escaped to southern France in 1940. The Vichy government permitted him to leave for the United States in 1941 and he obtained a visiting position at Columbia University in New York. He moved to London in 1944 and returned to France when the war ended in 1945.\n Hadamard was awarded an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) by Yale University in October 1901, during celebrations for the bicentenary of the university.[10] He was awarded the CNRS Gold medal for his lifetime achievements in 1956. He died in Paris in 1963, aged ninety-seven.\n Hadamard's students included Maurice Fr\u00e9chet, Paul L\u00e9vy, Szolem Mandelbrojt and Andr\u00e9 Weil.\n In his book Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field,[6] Hadamard uses the results of introspection to study mathematical thought processes,[11] and tries to report and interpret observations, personal or gathered from other scholars engaged in the work of invention.[12] In sharp contrast to authors who identify language and cognition, he describes his own mathematical thinking as largely wordless, often accompanied by mental images that represent the entire solution to a problem. He surveyed 100 of the leading physicists of the day (approximately 1900), asking them how they did their work.\n Hadamard described the experiences of the mathematicians/theoretical physicists Carl Friedrich Gauss, Hermann von Helmholtz, Henri Poincar\u00e9 and others as viewing entire solutions with \"sudden spontaneousness\".[13]\n Hadamard described the process as having four steps of the five-step Graham Wallas creative process model, with the first three also having been put forth by Helmholtz:[14] Preparation, Incubation, Illumination, and Verification.\n ", "tags": ["1865 births", "1963 deaths", "19th-century French mathematicians", "20th-century French mathematicians", "Jewish French scientists", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni", "Coll\u00e8ge de France faculty", "Columbia University faculty", "French atheists", "Jewish atheists", "French Jews", "French pacifists", "Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand alumni", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Corresponding Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1917\u20131925)", "Corresponding Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Number theorists", "PDE theorists", "People from Versailles", "University of Paris faculty", "Textbook writers", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from January 2018", "Biography with signature", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "All articles with failed verification", "Articles with failed verification from November 2018", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BPN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "AC with 25 elements", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "20th century French mathematician\n\"Hadamard\" redirects here.
