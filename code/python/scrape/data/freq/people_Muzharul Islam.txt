{"name": "Muzharul Islam", "content": "\n Muzharul Islam (25 December 1923 \u2013 15 July 2012) was a Bangladeshi architect, urban planner, educator and activist. He is considered as the Grand Master of regional modernism in South Asia.[by whom?] Islam is the pioneer of modern architecture in Bangladesh and the father of Bengali modernism.[2] Islam's style and influence dominated the architectural scene in the country during the 1960s and 70s, along with major US architects he brought to work in Dhaka.\n As a teacher[by whom?], architect, social and political activist, Islam set the course of architectural practice in the country not only through his own many varied works but also through being instrumental in inviting architects[citation needed] like Louis Kahn[by whom?], Richard Neutra, Stanley Tigerman, Paul Rudolph, Robert Boughey and Konstantinos Doxiadis to work in Bangladesh.\n Muzharul Islam was born on 25 December 1923 in Murshidabad. He went to the United States in 1950 where he received his bachelor's degree in architecture from the University of Oregon. In 1956, he received a scholarship to study tropical architecture at the AA School of Architecture, London.[3] In 1961, he completed his post-graduation under Paul Rudolph from Yale University.[4] At Yale Stanley Tigerman was one of his classmates, and there he came in touch with Louis I Kahn.[5] Muzharul Islam began his career by designing two buildings in the Shahbag area in 1955 \u2013 Dhaka University Library and College of Arts and Crafts.[6] Between 1958 and 1964, Islam was an architect in C&B Dept of the Government of East Pakistan.[4]\n His most important work was born when the Governor's Conference of Pakistan decided in 1959, under the leadership of President Ayub Khan, that Dhaka will be second capital of Pakistan.[5] The government decided to build a capital complex at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Dhaka. Muzharul Islam was given to design Jatiyo Sangsad Bhaban[by whom?] (National Assembly Building of Bangladesh). But, he brought his teacher Louis Kahn[by whom?] into the project to do a significant work for future generation. Islam worked closely with him from 1965 to Kahn's death in 1973[by whom?].\n Along with Kahn[by whom?], he also brought Paul Rudolph and Stanley Tigerman to work in Bangladesh, and three of them came to be known as the American Trio. Apart from the Trio, it was Islam's monumental style that dominated Bangladesh architecture from the 1950s onwards.[5]\n His major works include \u2013 Jahangirnagar University, Chittagong University, Central Public Library, Charukala Institute, the Azimpur Estate, Rangmati township, and a number of Polytechnic Institutes.[4] Islam designed the master plan of Dhaka City.[citation needed] He also created the logo for the government of Bangladesh.[7][importance?]\n A documentary film on Mazharul Islam named Tini (The Architect) was released by Institute of Architects Bangladesh in 2000, which was directed by Enamul Karim Nirjhar.\n \n Muzharul Islam died on 15 July 2012 at 12.06 am in Dhaka, Bangladesh.[9] He was aged 88.\n Some publication featured Muzharul Islam:\n ", "tags": ["Bangladeshi architects", "1923 births", "Fellows of the American Institute of Architects", "Modernist architects", "20th-century Bangladeshi architects", "21st-century architects", "University of Oregon alumni", "Yale School of Architecture alumni", "2012 deaths", "Recipients of the Independence Day Award", "Accuracy disputes from January 2016", "CS1 Bengali-language sources (bn)", "CS1 uses Bengali-language script (bn)", "EngvarB from September 2014", "Use dmy dates from September 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from July 2019", "Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from July 2020", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from July 2020", "Articles with unsourced statements from January 2016", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For other people with the same name, see Mazhar ul Islam (disambiguation).\n\n\nMuzharul Islam\u09ae\u09be\u099c\u09b9\u09be\u09b0\u09c1\u09b2 \u0987\u09b8\u09b2\u09be\u09aeBorn(1923-12-25)25 December 1923Murshidabad, British IndiaDied15 July 2012(2012-07-15) (aged\u00a088)[1]Dhaka, BangladeshNationalityBangladeshiAlma\u00a0materUniversity of OregonYale UniversityAA School of ArchitectureOccupationArchitecteducatorAwardsGrand Master Award, South Asian Architecture Award CeremonyIndependence Day AwardPracticeVastukalabidBuildingsFaculty of Fine ArtsJahangirnagar University Master Plan and designsChittagong University master plan and designsBangladesh National Archive\n\nMuzharul Islam (25 December 1923 \u2013 15 July 2012) was a Bangladeshi architect, urban planner, educator and activist.

Symbol of what? Symbol of whom?... The hesitation in my mind has deep roots. I feel that human society has been kept in darkness for thousands of years by the use of symbols. I revolt against it. By raising the issue of symbols, in the name of symbols, my perspective has been kept limited.\"\n\"Cities should provide the environment for civilized life within the context of our own culture... The city can develop only as a part of the physical environment of the country- with the ultimate aim of abolishing all differences between the city and the rural areas. The traditional relationship with nature (still existing to a certain extent in the village of Bangladesh) should be continued in the cities.\"\n\"The artistic qualities are essence of architecture. The practical aspects of architecture are measurable \u2013 such as, the practical requirements, climatic judgements, the advantages and limitations of the site etc. \u2013 but the humanistic aspects are not measurable. This depends on the talent, sensitivity and creativity of the architect. Only some bookish knowledge is not a sufficient tool in this regard. One has to be creative. One has to love his own land, its people and its culture and think profoundly about these. The love of one's own land is the eternal source of creative power, which in turn, makes a proper architect.\"\n\"You have to be a world man and a Bengali. It's impossible otherwise... When I mention standing on one's own soil... it is to find oneself, but not to find oneself and become stagnant. What I am seeking is to stand on one's own feet and then to proceed forward. If for that reason I have to take two steps backward to go one step forward. I have no problem with that. I think that there is no other way of moving forward.\"\nSee also[edit]\nList of Bangladeshi architects\nSources[edit]\nKashef Mahboob Chowdhury (20 July 2003). \"Harmony of Vision\".
