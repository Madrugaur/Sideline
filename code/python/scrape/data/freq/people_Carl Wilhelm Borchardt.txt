{"name": "Carl Wilhelm Borchardt", "content": "Carl Wilhelm Borchardt (22 February 1817 \u2013 27 June 1880) was a German mathematician.\n Borchardt was born to a Jewish family in Berlin.[1] His father, Moritz, was a respected merchant, and his mother was Emma Heilborn.[1] Borchardt studied under a number of tutors, including Julius Pl\u00fccker and Jakob Steiner. He studied at the University of Berlin under Lejeune Dirichlet in 1836 and at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg in 1839.[1] In 1848 he began teaching at the University of Berlin.\n He did research in the area of the arithmetic-geometric mean, continuing work by Gauss and Lagrange. He generalised the results of Kummer on diagonalising symmetric matrices, using determinants and Sturm functions. He was also an editor of Crelle's Journal from 1856\u201380, during which time it was known as Borchardt's Journal.\n He died in R\u00fcdersdorf, Germany.
