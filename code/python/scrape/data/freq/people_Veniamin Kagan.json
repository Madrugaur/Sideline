He is the maternal grandfather of mathematicians Yakov Sinai and Grigory Barenblatt.\n Kagan was born in Shavli, in the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire (now \u0160iauliai, Lithuania) in 1869, to a poor Lithuanian Jewish family. In 1871 his family moved to Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipro), where he grew up.  Kagan entered the Imperial Novorossiya University in Odessa in 1887, but was expelled for revolutionary activities in 1889.  He was put on probation and sent back to Yekaterinoslav.

They tried to help him to obtain an academic position, but Kagan's Jewish background was an obstacle.  Only in 1897 was he allowed to become a dozent at the Imperial Novorossiya University, where he continued to work until 1923.
