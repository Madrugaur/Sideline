{"name": "John Casey (mathematician)", "content": "\n John Casey (12 May 1820, Kilbehenny, County Limerick, Ireland \u2013 3 January 1891, Dublin) was a respected Irish geometer. He is most famous for Casey's theorem on a circle that is tangent to four other circles, an extension of Ptolemy's theorem. However, he contributed several novel proofs and perspectives on Euclidean geometry. He and \u00c9mile Lemoine are considered to be the co-founders of the modern geometry of the circle and the triangle.[1]\n He was born at Kilbehenny in Limerick, Ireland and educated locally at Mitchelstown, before becoming a teacher under the Board of National Education. He later became headmaster of the Central Model Schools in Kilkenny City. He subsequently entered Trinity College Dublin in 1858, where he was elected a Scholar in 1861 and was awarded the degree of BA in 1862. He was then Mathematics Master at Kingston School (1862\u20131873), Professor of Higher Mathematics and Mathematical Physics at the newly founded Catholic University of Ireland (1873\u20131881) and Lecturer in Mathematics at its successor, the University College Dublin (1881\u20131891).[2]\u00a0\n In 1869, the University of Dublin awarded Casey the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1875.[3] He was elected to the Royal Irish Academy and in 1880 became a member of its council. In 1878 the Academy conferred upon him the much coveted Cunningham Gold Medal.[4] His work was also acknowledged by the Norwegian Government, among others. He was elected a member of the Societe Mathematique de France in 1884 and received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the Royal University of Ireland in 1885.\n ", "tags": ["1820 births", "1891 deaths", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Geometers", "Irish mathematicians", "People from County Kilkenny", "Scholars of Trinity College Dublin", "19th-century British mathematicians", "19th-century Irish people", "Members of the Royal Irish Academy", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from February 2020", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Use dmy dates from October 2019", "Use Hiberno-English from June 2019", "All Wikipedia articles written in Hiberno-English", "Articles with hCards", "Articles incorporating Cite DNB template", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DIB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nJohn CaseyBorn(1820-05-12)12 May 1820Kilbehenny, County Limerick, IrelandDied3 January 1891(1891-01-03) (aged\u00a070)DublinEducationTrinity College DublinOccupationgeometer, teacherEmployerUniversity College, Stephen's GreenKnown\u00a0forCasey's theoremParent(s)William Casey (father)\nJohn Casey (12 May 1820, Kilbehenny, County Limerick, Ireland \u2013 3 January 1891, Dublin) was a respected Irish geometer.
