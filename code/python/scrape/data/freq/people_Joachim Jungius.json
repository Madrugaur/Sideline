{"name": "Joachim Jungius", "content": "Joachim Jungius (born Joachim Junge; 22 October 1587 \u2013 23 September 1657) was a German mathematician, logician and philosopher of science.\n Jungius was a native of L\u00fcbeck. He studied metaphysics at the Universities of Rostock and Giessen, where in 1608 he earned his degree.\n Beginning in 1609, he was a professor of mathematics at the University of Giessen, and in 1614\u201315, with Wolfgang Ratke (1571\u20131635) and Christoph Helvig (1581\u20131617), he took part in studies of educational reform. In 1616, he returned to Rostock in order to study medicine, later obtaining his medical doctorate from the University of Padua with Santorio Santorio  in 1619. From 1619 to 1623, he practiced medicine in L\u00fcbeck. In 1622 at Rostock, he founded an early scientific society known as Societas Ereunetica sive Zetetica.\n From 1624 to 1628, Jungius worked as a professor of mathematics at Rostock, his service here being briefly interrupted in 1625, when he spent time as professor of medicine at the University of Helmstedt. From 1629 until 1657, he was professor of natural sciences at the Akademisches Gymnasium, a secondary school in Hamburg. Jungius believed that science was based on mathematics, and in Hamburg stressed the importance of critical thinking to his students. He also felt that mathematics and logic served as a remedy to metaphysical and mystical speculation.\n He died in Hamburg.\n Jungius was an important figure of 17th century atomism, and was an advocate of a \"corpuscular chemistry\" that assumed the conservation of mass. He also demonstrated that a catenary was not a parabola.\n In 1638 he published the textbook Logica Hamburgensis, which presented late medieval theories and techniques of logic. Here he demonstrated oblique cases of arguments that did not adhere to simpler forms of inference; An example being: \"The square of an even number is even; 6 is even; therefore, the square of 6 is even\". His double position as connected to scholastic logic, but also to innovations, earns him the classification semi-Ramist.[1]\n Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz wrote,\n ", "tags": ["1587 births", "1657 deaths", "17th-century German physicians", "German philosophers", "17th-century German mathematicians", "Scientists from L\u00fcbeck", "University of Giessen faculty", "Academics of the University of Rostock", "17th-century German writers", "17th-century German male writers", "Commons link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Botanist identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " Joachim Jungius (1587\u20131657)\nJoachim Jungius (born Joachim Junge; 22 October 1587 \u2013 23 September 1657) was a German mathematician, logician and philosopher of science.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Works\n3 Bibliography\n4 Citations\n5 Further reading\n6 External links\n\n\nLife[edit]\nJungius was a native of L\u00fcbeck.
