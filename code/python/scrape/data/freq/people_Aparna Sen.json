{"name": "Aparna Sen", "content": "\n Aparna Sen (n\u00e9e\u00a0Dasgupta, \u00d4porna Shen; born 25 October 1945) is an Indian film director, screenwriter and actress who is known for her work in Bengali cinema. She has received multiple awards, including nine National Film Awards and a Padma Shri.[1]\n Sen was born in a Bengali family, originally from Cox's Bazar in Chittagong District (now in Bangladesh). Her father was the veteran critic and filmmaker Chidananda Dasgupta. Her mother Supriya Dasgupta was a  costume designer and earned the National Film Award for Best Costume Design for Chidananda's directorial venture Amodini (1995), at the age of 73. Sen is a relative of Bengali poet Jibanananda Das.[2] Sen spent her childhood in Hazaribagh and Kolkata and had her schooling at Modern High School for Girls, Kolkata, India. She studied for her B.A. in English at Presidency College, but did not complete the degree.[3]\n Sen made her film debut at the age of 15, when she played the role of Mrinmoyee in the Samapti portion of the 1961 film Teen Kanya (Three Daughters) directed by Satyajit Ray (who was a longtime friend of her father's). She then studied at Kolkata's Presidency College.\n At fifteen she was photographed by Brian Brake for the well-known photo from his 1960 \"Monsoon\" series of photographs; the photo appeared on the cover of Life.[4]\n In 2009, Sen appeared with Sharmila Tagore and Rahul Bose in Annirudh Roy-Chowdhary's Bengali film Antaheen. The film went on to win four National Film Awards.[5]\n In 2009, Sen announced her next Bengali film Iti Mrinalini, which starred Konkona Sen Sharma, Aparna Sen, Rajat Kapoor, Kaushik Sen, and Priyanshu Chatterjee. First-time screenwriter Ranjan Ghosh co-authored Iti Mrinalini. This was the first time that Sen collaborated with any film writer or became attached to the curriculum of a film institute. The screenplay of Iti Mrinalini was an assignment in the Screenwriting syllabus at the Mumbai-based film school Whistling Woods International.[6] It was also a major first in Indian screenwriting, as the first time that any screenplay from an Indian film institute was actually filmed.[7] The film was released on 29 July 2011.\n In 2013, her film Goynar Baksho (The Jewellery Box) was released depicting three generations of women and their relationship to a box of jewels. It ran to packed houses and won critical acclaim from reviewers and critics.[8] Thereafter, in 2015, Arshinagar, an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet was released.[9]\n In 2017, Sonata\u2014an English film written and directed by Sen\u2014was released. Adapted from a play by Mahesh Elkunchwar, the film examines the life of three middle-aged unmarried friends played by Aparna Sen, Shabana Azmi and Lillete Dubey.[10]\n Sen has served on juries at film festivals around the world. In 1989 she was a member of the jury at the 16th Moscow International Film Festival.[11] In 2008, she was elected into the International Jury of the Asia Pacific Screen Awards. In 2013, she headed the jury of the second Ladakh International Film Festival.[12]\n From 1986 to 2005, Sen was the editor of the fortnightly Sananda, a Bengali women's magazine (published by the Ananda Bazar Patrika group) that enjoys equal popularity in West Bengal and Bangladesh. From November 2005 to December 2006, she was associated with the Bengali 24x7 infotainment channel Kolkata TV as Creative Director. In 2011 she took charge as the editor of the magazine Paroma launched by the Saradha Group.[13]  Following the Saradha Group financial scandal, Paroma ran into trouble. It finally closed down on 14 April 2013. Sen and her editorial team launched a new magazine called Prathama Ekhon, which was short-lived.[14]\n In 1987, the then President of India, Giani Zail Singh bestowed the Padma Shri on Sen in recognition of her contribution to Indian cinema. Since then, she has received several lifetime achievement awards.\n ", "tags": ["1945 births", "Actresses in Bengali cinema", "Bengali film directors", "Brahmos", "Bengali Hindus", "Bangladeshi Hindus", "Indian film actresses", "20th-century Indian film directors", "Indian women film directors", "Indian women screenwriters", "Living people", "Recipients of the Padma Shri in arts", "Actresses from Kolkata", "Presidency University, Kolkata alumni", "University of Calcutta alumni", "Kalakar Awards winners", "20th-century Indian actresses", "21st-century Indian film directors", "21st-century Indian actresses", "Women writers from West Bengal", "21st-century Indian women writers", "21st-century Indian dramatists and playwrights", "20th-century Indian women writers", "20th-century Indian dramatists and playwrights", "Hindi screenwriters", "Best Director National Film Award winners", "Film directors from Kolkata", "Screenwriters from Kolkata", "Women artists from West Bengal", "Best Original Screenplay National Film Award winners", "Directors who won the Best Film on National Integration National Film Award", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "EngvarB from August 2014", "Use dmy dates from August 2014", "BLP articles lacking sources from June 2019", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with TePapa identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Indian filmmaker, script writer and actress\n\n\nThis biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.
