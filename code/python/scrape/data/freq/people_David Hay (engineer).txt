During 1884 and 1885 he worked on a new dock at Silloth, near Carlisle, before spending three years on widening North Eastern Railway lines in and near Newcastle-upon-Tyne.[1]\n He then became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Sir Benjamin Baker, working with him on the first Blackwall Tunnel in the 1890s,[3] about which he wrote a paper with Maurice Fitzmaurice published by the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1897.[4] Watt Medals and Telford Premiums were awarded to David Hay, M.
