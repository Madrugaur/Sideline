She became her high school valedictorian in 1913, graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1917, and earned a master's degree there in 1918. After teaching mathematics for two years, she returned to graduate study in 1920, and completed her Ph.D. at Minnesota in 1924. Both students were supervised by Dunham Jackson;[1] Carlson's dissertation, in functional analysis, was On The Convergence of Certain Methods of Closest Approximation.[3]\n She joined the Minnesota faculty, and remained there until her retirement in 1965 as a full professor.[1]\nShe has no record of supervising doctoral dissertations,[3]\nand published little research after the work of her own dissertation.\nHowever, she supervised several master's students, \nand was described as a mentor by Margaret P.
