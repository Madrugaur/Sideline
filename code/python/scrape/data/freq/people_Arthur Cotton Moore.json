{"name": "Arthur Cotton Moore", "content": "Arthur Cotton Moore (born April 12, 1935) is an American architect who has achieved national and international recognition for his contributions to architecture, master planning, furniture design, painting, and writing.\n Moore began his professional practice in 1965 and is best known for expanding the purview of the country\u2019s nascent Preservation Movement, from the restoration of historic manor houses to re-purposing urban industrial structures.  His first project\u2013\u2013Canal Square, in Washington D.C.\u2019s Georgetown neighborhood\u2013\u2013was the earliest recognized manifestation of combining an old mercantile building with major new construction.\n Moore is also known for the Washington Harbour development on the Potomac River in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., the Goh Annex of the Phillips Collection also in Washington, D.C., and the renovation and modernization of the Thomas Jefferson and John Adams buildings of the Library of Congress, the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, and the renovation of Washington D.C.'s tallest residential building, the Cairo Hotel.\n Arthur Cotton Moore spent his early years at \u201cTanglebank,\u201d his grandparents\u2019 Victorian house off Connecticut Avenue in the Kalorama neighborhood of NW Washington, D.C., now the site of a new People's Republic of China building providing housing for its embassy personnel.\n Moore\u2019s maternal grandfather was Admiral Ridley McLean.

Moore is a relative by marriage of Senator James McMillan of Michigan, Chairman of the 1900 McMillan Commission, which authored the second Master Plan of the National Mall (McMillan Plan).\n Moore has described his architectural style in his non-preservation work as Modernism with Baroque sensibilities. Some have referred to this style as \u201cpost-postmodernism.\u201d[1] It is a lighter, even an entertaining modern interpretation of the exuberant style that flourished in Europe from the middle of the 17th century to the early 18th century. ''People are tired of endless grid-crunching,'' Moore said. ''Baroque deals with modern design's fear and loathing of the curve - just what I think is missing in modern design.''[1]\n Since 1965, Moore has received 70 Design Awards including:\n Moore has served as chairman and member on design award and architectural-commission award juries throughout the United States, across the spectrum of design recognition programs, including:\n The international publicity generated by the many facets of the Washington Harbour Complex\u2013\u2013Architecture, Urban Design, residential/office/commercial uses, a visionary flood control system, fountains, and its siting on the Potomac River\u2013\u2013prompted requests from specific groups for a combination slide presentation, guided tour, and Q&A session:\n These following articles on the solo exhibitions were published in newspapers and magazines between 1989 and 1995:\n Journal of the American Institute of Architects:\n \u201cThe Pennsylvania Avenue Plan.\u201d St. Albans Bulletin, May 1965\n \u201cAdvise and Consult.\u201d Library of Congress Information Bulletin.

It was re-adapted with new construction in 1970 at a cost of US$2.5 million. Located alongside the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in the then-neglected industrial waterfront area, the project repurposed the warehouse by joining it with a sympathetic modern addition, bringing new life to the area.  This led to similar programs across the country in a practice that became known as \u201cadaptive reuse,\u201d using existing building equity in a strategic way as an alternative to the devastation brought about by urban renewal and other economic development programs.  Eighty-four articles on Canal Square were published in national and international newspapers, magazines, and books.\nWashington Harbour on the Georgetown waterfront (Washington, D.C.)\nThe US$80 million restoration and modernization of the Thomas Jefferson and John Adams Buildings of the Library of Congress (Washington, D.C.)\nRenovation of the Old Post Office building, completed in 1982 (Washington, D.C.)\nMadeira School, an early solar-energy building  (Washington, D.C.)\nThe Cairo Hotel, an 1894 building and the tallest privately owned building in Washington, D.C., remodeled for US$2.7 million from a neglected hotel to a profitable condominium\nThe Foundry, along the C&O Canal in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. included an existing historic foundry together with new construction.\nThe Phillips Collection renovation and the Goh Annex (Washington, D.C.)\nBedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Center (Brooklyn, NY)\nFoxhall Crescents (Washington, D.C.)\nCathedral of St. John the Baptist (Charleston, South Carolina)\nLobby, entrance canopy, and Rizik\u2019s Pavilion. 1100 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington D.C.\nNational Awards for Architecture and Furniture Design[edit]\nSince 1965, Moore has received 70 Design Awards including:\n\n1977: The American Institute of Architects, in accordance with the judgment of its Honor Awards Jury, presented an Honor Award to Arthur Cotton Moore/Associates for achievement of excellence in Architectural Design of Canal Square (June 1977)\n1999: The American Institute of Architects, in accordance with the judgment of its Honor Award Jury, presented an Honor Award for Architecture to the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. for Excellence in Architectural Design by the Architect of the Capitol and Arthur Cotton Moore/Associates, Associate Architect.

Supported under the Title II provisions of the Water Resources Research Act of 1964 and funded by the Office of Water Resources, U.S. Department of the Interior.
