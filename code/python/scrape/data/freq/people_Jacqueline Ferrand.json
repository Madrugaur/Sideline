{"name": "Jacqueline Ferrand", "content": "Jacqueline Lelong-Ferrand (17 February 1918, Al\u00e8s, France \u2013 26 April 2014, Sceaux, France) was a French mathematician who worked on conformal representation theory, potential theory, and Riemannian manifolds. She taught at universities in  Caen, Lille, and Paris.[1][2][3]\n Ferrand was born in Al\u00e8s, the daughter of a classics teacher, and went to secondary school in N\u00eemes.[4]\nIn 1936 the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure began admitting women, and she was one of the first to apply and be admitted. In 1939 she and Roger Ap\u00e9ry placed first in the mathematics agr\u00e9gation; she began teaching at a girls' school in S\u00e8vres, while continuing to do mathematics research under the supervision of Arnaud Denjoy, publishing three papers in 1941 and defending a doctoral thesis in 1942.[4][5][6] In 1943 she won the Girbal-Baral Prize of the French Academy of Sciences, and obtained a faculty position at the University of Bordeaux. She moved to the University of Caen in 1945, was given a chair at the University of Lille in 1948, and in 1956 moved to the University of Paris as a full professor. She retired in 1984.[4][5][7]\n Ferrand had nearly 100 mathematical publications, including ten books,[5] and was active in mathematical research into her late 70s.[4] \nOne of her accomplishments, in 1971, was to prove the compactness of the group of conformal mappings of a non-spherical compact Riemannian manifold, resolving a conjecture of Andr\u00e9 Lichnerowicz, and on the basis of this work she became an invited speaker at the 1974 International Congress of Mathematicians in Vancouver.[4][7]\n She married mathematician Pierre Lelong in 1947, taking his surname alongside hers in her subsequent publications[5] until their separation in 1977.[4][7]\n ", "tags": ["1918 births", "2014 deaths", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni", "French mathematicians", "Women mathematicians", "Disease-related deaths in France", "People from Al\u00e8s", "20th-century French women scientists", "Articles with French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French mathematician\nJacqueline Lelong-Ferrand (17 February 1918, Al\u00e8s, France \u2013 26 April 2014, Sceaux, France) was a French mathematician who worked on conformal representation theory, potential theory, and Riemannian manifolds.
