{"name": "Eduardo Souto de Moura", "content": "\n Eduardo El\u00edsio Machado Souto de Moura (Portuguese pronunciation:\u00a0[e\u02c8\u00f0wa\u027e\u00f0u \u02c8sowtu d\u0268 \u02c8mow\u027e\u0250]; born 25 July 1952), better known as Eduardo Souto de Moura, is a Portuguese architect who was the recipient of the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2011[1][2][3] and the Wolf Prize in Arts in 2013.[4][5] Along with Fernando T\u00e1vora and \u00c1lvaro Siza, he is one of the alumni of the Porto School of Architecture, where he was appointed a Professor.\n Souto de Moura is the son of medical doctor Jos\u00e9 Alberto Souto de Moura and wife Maria Teresa Ramos Machado.  His brother is Jos\u00e9 Souto de Moura, former 9th Attorney-General of Portugal.\n Souto de Moura was born in Porto, and studied sculpture[6] before switching to architecture at the School of Fine Arts of the University of Porto, the current FAUP \u2013 Faculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade do Porto, and receiving his degree in 1980. From 1974 to 1979 he worked with \u00c1lvaro Siza Vieira at his architectural practice, who encouraged him to start his own firm.[6]\n Souto de Moura began his career as an independent architect in 1980, after winning a design competition for the Casa das Artes, a cultural center with an auditorium and an exhibition gallery in the gardens of a neo-classical mansion, in his native city of Porto. However, Souto de Moura collaborated with Siza on the Portuguese pavilion at the Expo 2000 in Hanover, Germany, and Serpentine Gallery's annual summer pavilion in 2004.\n Souto de Moura's early commissions were often modest residential houses, mainly in his native country. Later, he was commissioned with shopping centers, schools, art galleries, and a cinema, in countries including Spain, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. Between 1989 and 1997, Souto de Moura spent eight years on the restoration of Santa Maria do Bouro, a half-destroyed 12th-century monastery in Amares, transforming it into a Pousada.[7]\n From 1981 to 1990, Souto de Moura was an assistant professor at his alma mater, and was later appointed Professor at the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Porto.[8] He has been a visiting professor at the architectural schools of Geneva, Paris-Belleville, Harvard University, Dublin, ETH Zurich and EPFL Lausanne, and has participated in numerous seminars and given many lectures both in Portugal and abroad. His work has appeared in various publications and exhibitions.\n On 28 March 2011, it was announced that Moura is the 2011 Pritzker Prize winner, architecture's highest honor.[3] He is the second Portuguese architect to win the honor, after \u00c1lvaro Siza.[2] The prize was supposed to be presented in April in Washington DC but the winner was prematurely leaked by a Spanish news organisation.[9] The prize was awarded for his work including Est\u00e1dio Municipal de Braga, the Burgo Tower in Porto and the Paula Rego Museum in Cascais.[9] On 3 January 2012, it was announced Moura is the 2013 Wolf Prize in Arts winner along with Robert S. Langer.[10]\n He has been also awarded: The Pessoa prize in 1998; the Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Foundation prize; the Antero de Quental Foundation prize; first prize in the Competition for the Restoration of Giraldo Square in \u00c9vora, Portugal; first prize in the Competition for the CIAC Pavilions; first prize in the Competition for a Hotel in Salzburg, Austria; first prize in the \"IN/ARCH 1990 for Sicily\" Competition; the Secil Prize for Architecture;[11] second prize in the \"Architecture and Stone\" ideas competition; honourable mention for his Miramar House in the Secil Architectural Prizes; honourable mention for both the SEC Cultural Centre and the Alcanena House in the National Architectural Prizes.
