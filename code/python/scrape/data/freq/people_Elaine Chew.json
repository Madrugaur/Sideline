{"name": "Elaine Chew", "content": "Elaine Chew is an operations researcher and pianist focused on the study of musical structures as they apply to musical performance, composition and cognition,[1] and in the analysis of electrocardiographic traces of arrhythmia.[2][3] She is currently a senior researcher at the Science et Technologies de la Musique et du Son (STMS) Laboratory, where she is affiliated with the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), which together with the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM), Sorbonne University, and the French Ministry of Culture constitute the joint research laboratory.\n Born in Buffalo, New York, Chew grew up in Singapore, returning to the US after high school for further studies.[4] She received a Bachelor of Arts and Sciences in Mathematical and Computational Sciences with honours and Music with distinction from Stanford University. Her PhD thesis in the Operations Research Center at MIT was focused on the mathematics of tonality.[5] Chew holds diplomas in piano performance from Trinity College, London.[6]\n Chew has designed a theory of tonality called the spiral array model.[7][8] This is a mathematical model using spirals to describe how humans perceive pitches, chords and keys in music.
