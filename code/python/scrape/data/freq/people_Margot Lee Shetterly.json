Her first book, Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race (2016), is about African-American women mathematicians working at NASA who were instrumental to the success of the United States space program. She sold the movie rights while still working on the book, and it was adapted as a feature film of the same name, Hidden Figures (2016).[1] For several years Shetterly and her husband lived and worked in Mexico, where they founded and published Inside Mexico, a magazine directed to English-speaking expats.\n Margot Lee was born in 1969 in Hampton, Virginia. Her father worked as a research scientist at Langley Research Center,[2][3] and her mother was an English professor at the historically black Hampton University.[4] Lee grew up knowing many African-American families with members who worked at NASA.

Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, and Kevin Costner. The film was nominated for several awards, including three Oscar nominations (Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Octavia Spencer).\n In 2013, Shetterly founded The Human Computer Project, an organization whose mission is to archive the work of all of the women who worked as computers and mathematicians in the early days of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).[8]\n In 2018, Shetterly published the picture book, Hidden Figures: The True Story of Four Black Women and the Space Race.
