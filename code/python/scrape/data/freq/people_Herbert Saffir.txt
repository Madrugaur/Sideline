{"name": "Herbert Saffir", "content": "Herbert Seymour Saffir (29 March 1917 \u2013 21 November 2007) (/\u02c8s\u00e6f\u0259r/ (listen)[1]) was an American civil engineer who co-developed (with meteorologist Robert Simpson) the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale for measuring the intensity of hurricanes. As recently as 2005 Saffir was the principal of Saffir Engineering[2] in Coral Gables, Florida. He also published articles on designing buildings for high wind resistance.[3]\n Originally from Brooklyn, Saffir graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1940 with a B.S. in civil engineering.[4] Saffir worked for Dade County, Florida beginning in 1947 as an assistant county engineer, and worked on updating the county building code. Since that time, he had traveled extensively to study windstorm damage for clues to improvements and has been a tireless advocate for stricter codes in hurricane-prone areas.\n In 1975 Saffir was working on a study of windstorm damage on low-cost housing commissioned by the United Nations (UN), Saffir developed a scale to categorize the intensity of hurricanes by their maximum wind speed. In 1969, his friend Bob Simpson, then-director of the National Hurricane Center (NHC), added information on the potential storm surge and range of central pressures for each category, resulting in what later became known as the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale.[5]\n Saffir survived the burning of the cruise ship SS\u00a0Morro Castle on 8 September 1934. The ship was en route from Havana to New York when it caught fire and burned, killing a total of 137 passengers and crew members.\n On 21 November 2007 Herbert Saffir died of a heart attack at South Miami Hospital in Miami according to his son, Richard Saffir. He was 90 years old.[6]\n ", "tags": ["1917 births", "2007 deaths", "Georgia Tech alumni", "People from Brooklyn", "American civil engineers", "Engineers from New York City", "20th-century American engineers", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with hAudio microformats", "Pages including recorded pronunciations", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "Herbert SaffirNWS Director Jack Kelly presents Herbert Saffir (on right) with a framed poster of Hurricane Andrew depicting the Saffir\u2013Simpson scaleBorn(1917-03-29)March 29, 1917Brooklyn, New York City, United StatesDiedNovember 21, 2007(2007-11-21) (aged\u00a090)Miami, FloridaEducationGeorgia Institute of TechnologyKnown\u00a0forSaffir\u2013Simpson scaleScientific careerFieldsCivil engineering\n\nHerbert Seymour Saffir (29 March 1917 \u2013 21 November 2007) (/\u02c8s\u00e6f\u0259r/ (listen)[1]) was an American civil engineer who co-developed (with meteorologist Robert Simpson) the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale for measuring the intensity of hurricanes.
