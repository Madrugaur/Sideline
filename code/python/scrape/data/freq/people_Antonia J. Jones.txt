{"name": "Antonia J. Jones", "content": "Antonia Jane Jones (1943 \u2013 2010) was a British mathematician and computer scientist. Her research considered number theory and computer science.\n Jones was born in 1943 in Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital. She was the first member of her family to attend university. Jones contracted polio as a child and lost both of her legs at the age of ten.[1][2] Jones attended the University of Reading, where she studied mathematics and physics and graduated both with first class honours.[3] She was a doctoral student in number theory at the University of Cambridge, where she completed her PhD in 1969. Jones joined the University of Nottingham after earning her doctorate, before joining Imperial College London as a Senior Lecturer. She spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study, after which she joined the faculty at the University of Colorado Boulder.[4]\n Jones returned to the United Kingdom in the 1970s, where she became a lecturer at Royal Holloway, University of London. Her interest switched from mathematics to computing and she started to explore acoustic pattern recognition.[2] Whilst Jones struggled with the early computers, when technology became more accessible for people with physical disabilities she launched her own firm creating random access video controllers.[2]\n In 1983 Jones joined Brunel University London at a lecturer in Information Technology.[2] Jones later served as Professor of Evolutionary and Neural Computing at Cardiff University.[5] She exposed various security loopholes in banking infrastructure, including identifying significant potential fraud at HSBC.[6][7]\n Alongside her scientific research, Jones was involved with science communication and public engagement. She served as an electronic data consultant on the 1986 film Rocinante.[8] She contributed to the 1998 British Science Association Festival of Science.[9] In 2007, Jones retired from Cardiff University.[1]\n Antonia Jones spent many years with her partner Tina Thomas at their shared farmhouse in the Brecon Beacons. Upon her retirement in 2007, Jones moved to St. Augustine, Florida.  Jones died on December 23, 2010. She is survived by her sister Jenny Carr and friend Tina Thomas.[1]\n ", "tags": ["British mathematicians", "1943 births", "2010 deaths", "Academics of Cardiff University", "Alumni of the University of Reading", "Number theorists", "LGBT scientists from the United Kingdom", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "British mathematician and computer scientist\nAntonia Jane JonesBorn1943Died2010 (aged\u00a066\u201367)Alma\u00a0materUniversity of Reading  University of CambridgeScientific careerInstitutionsCardiff UniversityThesisSums of roots of unity and cyclic overlattices\u00a0(1968)\nWebsiteAntonia J.
