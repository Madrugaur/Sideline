{"name": "Uttam Kumar", "content": "\n Uttam Kumar (born Arun Kumar Chatterjee; 3 September 1926 \u2013 24 July 1980), popularly known as the Mahanayak,[1] was an Indian film actor who predominantly worked in Bengali cinema.[2][3]\n Kumar's career starts with the 1948 film Drishtidan. One of his lauded appearance was in Satyajit Ray's Nayak (1966). It is now widely accepted that Ray wrote the script with Uttam in mind. Many people feel the film bears resemblance to Uttam Kumar's own life \u2013 the sense of anxiety and restlessness mirrored Uttam's insecurities about his phenomenal success and abiding fear that his superstardom might not last. Uttam made the role of Arindam (Mukherjee) his own and Ray later confessed that if Uttam had refused the film, he would have abandoned it. He worked with Ray the following year in Chiriyakhana (1967).[4]\n He explored new avenues of film-making by trying his hand at production, singing, composing music, screenplay writing and directing. The success of his Indian films as producer \u2014 Harano Sur, Saptapadi, Bhrantibilash, Jotugriha (1964), Grihadah \u2014 won greatest acclaim. On producing Chhoti Si Mulaqat in 1967, which was a Hindi film starring Uttam and Vyjayanthimala, Uttam almost used up all his savings, since the film had to be shot in colour and was shot in extravagant locations. Both Uttam and Vyjayanthimala had huge hopes associated with the film, but the film was a flop leading to great disappointment for Uttam Kumar. It was later said that this flop was one of the main reasons for triggering the heart attack, which ultimately led to his death.[5] Later, Uttam directed much-lauded films such as Sudhu Ekti Bochhor and Bon Palashir Padaboli. He composed music for the film Kaal Tumi Aleya in which Hemanta Mukherjee and Asha Bhosle sang to his tune.\n He came out with an authorised biography Aamar Ami in 1979\u201380. He had a phenomenal fan base which continues even to this day. In 1960, he started writing an autobiography named Harano Dinguli Mor (My Bygone Days), but could not complete it. Parts of that book were published by the magazine Nabokallol. On the day Uttam died, the original manuscript was stolen. Later, a member from Times of India had found the manuscript and the national library helped to find old editions of Nabakallol and then the incomplete book was finally published in the 37th Calcutta Book Fair. As a singer, he recorded songs for the AIR \u2013 All India Radio \u2013 and very recently, an album of Tagore songs (Rabindrasangeet) sung by him, has been brought out.[6]\n There was a time, when at the heights of his popularity Uttam Kumar was approached to recite the Chandi Path in the All India Radio (AIR) studios. Traditionally this had always been done by Birendra Krishna Bhadra. But there was a huge uproar amongst the audience as to why Uttam Kumar had been chosen instead of Birendra Krishna. Uttam personally met Mr. Bhadra and apologised and from the next year Mahalaya on AIR was again done by Bhadra.[7]\n Reruns of his films on television decades after his death are still eagerly watched. Uttam Kumar's time is considered by most as the Golden Era of Bengali cinema.[8]\n The on-screen chemistry between Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen has always been much adored and admired. Both of them together constituted the evergreen and popular romantic pair of Bengali Cinema till date. Some of Uttam's famous films co-starring Suchitra Sen include Share Chuattor, Agni Pariksha, Shilpi, Saptapadi,[9][10] Pathe Holo Deri, Harano Sur, Chaowa Paowa, Bipasha, Jiban Trishna, Sagarika, Trijama, Indrani, Sabar Upare, Surjyo Toron, Rajlakshmi O Sreekanto, \"Ekti Raat\", \"Grihadaha\", Kamallata, Har Mana Har, Alo Amar Alo.[11][12]\n Shonar Harin (1959) saw Supriya Devi (who would win great accolades for her performance in Ritwik Ghatak's Meghe Dhaka Tara the following year) play the lead opposite Uttam Kumar. As they began to act in more films together, the two got involved off-screen as well. In 1963, Uttam left his family home at Girish Mukherjee Road, Bhowanipur and stayed with Supriya for the next 17 years till his death. They starred together in several other films like Uttarayan, Chiradiner, Agni Sanskar, Suno Baranari, Kal Tumi Aleya, Lal Pathor, Andha Atit, Sudhu Ekti Bochhor, Mon Niye, Bilambita Loy, Bhola Maira, Sanyasi Raja, Bon Palashir Padabali, Sister, Jibon Mrityue, Bagh Bandir Khela.[13]\n Uttam Kumar married Gauri Chatterjee (1929-1981) in 1941. Later, he lived with actress Supriya Devi when he left his home at Girish Mukherjee road in 1963 till his death.[14]\n A workaholic, he was rumoured to have said that his preferred demise would be on the floor of a studio, doing what he loved best: acting. While filming Ogo Bodhu Shundori in 1980 Uttam Kumar suffered a stroke and was admitted to the Belle vue Clinic. The doctors did their best for 16 hours but he died that night on 24 July 1980 at the age of 53.[15][16]\n Tollygunge Metro station in Kolkata was renamed as Mahanayak Uttam Kumar Metro Station in his honour.\nThere is a theatre (Uttam Mancha) named after him in Kolkata. A life-size statue has been erected near Tollygunge metro station which has recently been renamed after the iconic actor by the Central Railway Ministry.[19] Besides, Shilpi Sansad, the actor's pet project of safegurading the artists especially the poor and the old, is active still. Celebrating the 89th birth anniversary of Uttam Kumar, the Department of Posts in 2009, released a series of new postal stamps featuring the actor on them.The Department of Posts also released a brochure on the Uttam Kumar Stamp release with a note that says \"Uttam Kumar \u2013 The Legend of Indian Cinema\". The Government of India on 19 June 2015, released the \"UTTAM\" Award for Best acting. In the year of 2016, a television series called \"Mahanayak\" was telecast. It was based on his life.[20]\n ", "tags": ["Bengali male actors", "Indian male film actors", "Male actors from Kolkata", "Male actors in Bengali cinema", "Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration alumni", "University of Calcutta alumni", "Best Actor National Film Award winners", "1980 deaths", "1926 births", "20th-century Indian male actors", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with style issues from April 2018", "All articles with style issues", "Articles needing additional references from October 2017", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with multiple maintenance issues", "EngvarB from October 2019", "Use dmy dates from October 2019", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Indian actor, director and producer\nFor the Indian artist, see Uttam Kumar (artist).\n\"Mahanayak\" redirects here.
