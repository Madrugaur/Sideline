{"name": "Ben Rich", "content": "Benjamin Robert Rich (June 18, 1925 \u2013 January 5, 1995) was an American engineer and the second Director of Lockheed's Skunk Works from 1975 to 1991, succeeding its founder, Kelly Johnson. Regarded as the \"father of stealth\",[1] Rich was responsible for leading the development of the F-117, the first production stealth aircraft. He also worked on the F-104, U-2, A-12, SR-71, and F-22, among others.\n Rich was born in Manila in the Philippines. He was one of five children of British lumber mill superintendent Isidore Rich and his French wife, Annie, the daughter of one of his paternal grandfather's Jewish customers who lived in Alexandria, Egypt. The Rich family was one of the first Jewish families to settle in Manila. Having fled the Philippines just weeks before the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, they moved to the United States in 1942, where Rich became a naturalized US citizen. He worked (with his father) in a Los Angeles, California, machine shop during World War II, and studied at the city's Hamilton High School. After the war he started his college education when he was 21, majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley, followed by a master's degree in aeronautical engineering at UCLA, instead of in the medical field as he originally planned.[2]  He would later complete the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School.[3]\n Upon graduation Rich was hired by Lockheed as a thermodynamicist. There he worked on a variety of projects - he was awarded a patent for designing a nichrome heating system which prevented Navy patrol plane crew members' penises from freezing to their urine elimination pipes. He designed inlet ducts for the F-104 Starfighter, the C-130 transport aircraft, and the F-90 fighter.\n In December 1954 Rich was transferred to the Skunk Works, the secret research and development section run by Lockheed's Chief Engineer, Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson. There he designed the inlet ducts for the U-2 spy plane, then next led the effort to design and build a large-scale hydrogen liquefaction plant for project Suntan, a proposed hydrogen-powered supersonic very high-altitude aircraft meant to replace the U-2. After Suntan was canceled, hydrogen proving to be impractical for a number of reasons, Rich became propulsion systems program manager for the U-2's successors, the A-12 and the SR-71 Blackbird. Rich was chief aerodynamicist for the projects, designer of the complex translating shock cones inlet design, air conditioning and heat management systems, and the specification of the aircraft's black skin coatings which optimized heat dissipation of their tremendous aerodynamic heating as well as incorporating materials to reduce radar signature \u2013 the aircraft incorporated a number of features of what would later be referred to as low observables or stealth technology. \n When SR-71 crews became upset that engineers were not putting enough effort into solving a constant problem with violent engine unstarts in flight, Rich considered taking a flight in the SR-71 to experience the phenomenon himself, which included having to go through the same flight physical as pilots. He did not go through with the flight. He did, however, eventually manage the problem by installing automatic controllers to keep the aircraft in control during unstarts.\n He briefly worked on a program that used ionizing radiation to help absorb radar coming from ahead of the aircraft. The radiation proved to be excessive and the test pilot disliked the heavy radiation shielding he was forced to wear. The project was cancelled when the military decided the radar signature was already low enough without the ionizing equipment. The concept was proven to work, but unfeasible.[4]\n Later, as Johnson's successor as leader of the Skunk Works, Rich championed and directed the early experimental prototypes of stealth technology and led the development of the F-117 stealth fighter.\n He is the author of Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed.\n[5]\n A member of the National Academy of Engineering, he won numerous awards during his career, including the Collier Trophy. In 2005 he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame.  In January 1981, he received the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service for his work on the then-still-classified stealth airplane, in a secret ceremony in the office of then-Secretary of Defense Harold Brown.[6] He was allowed to show the medal to his two children, Karen and Michael, but was not allowed to tell them why he had received it.[7]\n In 1950, Rich married Faye Mayer, a fashion model, who died in 1980. In 1982, Rich married Hilda Elliot. His son, Michael, is the president and CEO of RAND Corporation and his daughter, Karen, is a botanist.[citation needed]\n Rich died of esophageal cancer in Ventura, California, on January 5, 1995.\n ", "tags": ["1925 births", "1995 deaths", "Filipino emigrants to the United States", "Lockheed people", "Collier Trophy recipients", "National Aviation Hall of Fame inductees", "People from Manila", "Naturalized citizens of the United States", "Lockheed Martin people", "Deaths from esophageal cancer", "Deaths from cancer in California", "UC Berkeley College of Engineering alumni", "University of California, Los Angeles alumni", "Harvard Business School Advanced Management Program attendees", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from July 2017", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2019", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American aircraft designer\nThis article is about the Lockheed Skunk Works Director.
