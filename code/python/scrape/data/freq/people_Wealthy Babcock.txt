{"name": "Wealthy Babcock", "content": "Wealthy Consuelo Babcock (November 11, 1895 \u2013 April 10, 1990) was an American mathematician. She was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Kansas and had a long teaching career at that institution.[1]\n Wealthy Consuelo Babcock was born in Washington County, Kansas, the second child of Ella Babcock (nee, Kerr) and Cassius Lincoln Babcock. She graduated in 1913 from Washington County High School and taught for two years in one-room country schools in Washington County. The following year, she matriculated at the University of Kansas where she was a member of the women's basketball team. After receiving her Bachelor of Arts in 1919, she taught for a year at Neodesha High School in southeastern Kansas. She then returned to the University of Kansas in 1920 as an instructor.\n In addition to teaching at the University, Wealthy pursued her graduate studies, earning a master's in 1922 and a doctorate with a minor in physics in 1926. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1926 and to associate professor in 1940. She retired in 1966. During her tenure on the Kansas faculty, she regularly attended meetings of the Kansas Section of the Mathematical Association of America.\n She was an outstanding teacher and for thirty years she was the mathematics department's librarian.[2]\n After her retirement, Wealthy Babcock was honored by the dedication of the Wealthy Babcock Mathematics Library. She served on many committees on scholarships and awards and was particularly active in the KU Alumni Association's activities, for which she received the Fred Ellsworth Medallion, the highest award for service, in 1977.\n Wealthy Babcock died in 1990 at ninety-four at Presbyterian Manor in Lawrence, Kansas.
