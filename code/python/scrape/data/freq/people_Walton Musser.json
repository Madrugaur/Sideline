His varied career includes experience in many diverse fields. He was research advisor to the Department of Defense for 15 years. With other industrial and government organizations, he has served as chief engineer, director of research, and consultant. He held professional engineering licences in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. As a research adviser to United Shoe Machinery Corp.,[note 1] he explored nonrigid-body mechanics, using controlled deflection as an operating medium. In 1957 Musser announced invention of strain wave gearing also known as harmonic gearing (U. S. patent 2,906,143). He is also the inventor of first fluidic stepper actuators[2]\n ", "tags": ["Engineers from Pennsylvania", "1909 births", "1998 deaths", "People from Lancaster, Pennsylvania", "20th-century American engineers", "20th-century American inventors", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "Clarence Walton Musser (1909, Lancaster, Pennsylvania \u2013 June 8, 1998) inventor of  strain wave gearing and also credited with over 250 major inventions and discoveries.[1]\nSome of his inventions were the Army recoilless rifle, aircraft personnel catapults, instrumentation for underwater detonation testing.
