His book, Treatise on Problems of Maxima and Minima, was promoted by the prominent mathematician Augustus De Morgan.\n In his introduction to Ramchundra's book, De Morgan says that he was born in 1821 in Panipat to Sunder Lal, a Kayasth of Delhi. De Morgan came to know of Ramchundra when, in 1850, he was sent by a friend to work on maxima and minima by the 29-year-old self-taught mathematician. Ramchundra had published his book at his own expense in Calcutta in that year. De Morgan arranged for the book to be republished in London under his own supervision.\n De Morgan was so impressed that he undertook to bring Ramchundra's work to the notice of scientific men of Europe.\n Charles Muses, in an article in the Mathematical Intelligencer (1998) called Ramchundra \"De Morgan's Ramanujan\". He was mystified why, in spite of De Morgan's efforts to make this \"remarkable Hindu algebraist known, he does not appear in most texts on history of mathematics.\"He is also known for his great ability to calculate.\n Ramchundra was teacher of science in Delhi College for some time.
