{"name": "Frances Kirwan", "content": "\n Dame Frances Clare Kirwan, DBE FRS (born 1959) is a British mathematician, currently Savilian Professor of Geometry at the University of Oxford. Her fields of specialisation are algebraic and symplectic geometry.[1][2]\n Kirwan was educated at Oxford High School, and studied maths as an undergraduate at Clare College in the University of Cambridge.[3] She took a D.Phil at Oxford in 1984, with the dissertation title The Cohomology of Quotients in Symplectic and Algebraic Geometry, which was supervised by Michael Atiyah.[4]\n Kirwan's research interests include moduli spaces in algebraic geometry, geometric invariant theory (GIT), and in the link between GIT and moment maps in symplectic geometry.[5] Her work endeavours to understand the structure of geometric objects by investigation of their algebraic and topological properties.[6] She  introduced the Kirwan map. From 1983 to 1985 she held a Junior Fellowship at Harvard. From 1983 to 1986 she held a Fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford, before becoming a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford.[7] She is an honorary fellow at Clare College, Cambridge.[8]\n In 1996 she was awarded the Title of Distinction of Professor of Mathematics. From 2004 to 2006 she was President of the London Mathematical Society, the second-youngest president in the society's history and only the second woman to be president.[9][10] In 2005, she received a five-year EPSRC Senior Research Fellowship, to support her research on the moduli spaces of complex algebraic curves.[11]\n In 2017, she was elected Savilian Professor of Geometry, becoming the first woman to hold the post.[12] While this entailed a move to New College, Oxford she was elected an Emeritus Fellow at Balliol.[13]\n Kirwan served on the medal selection committee for the awarding of the Fields medal to Prof Mirzakhani.[19]\n ", "tags": ["1959 births", "Living people", "20th-century British mathematicians", "21st-century British mathematicians", "Algebraic geometers", "British women mathematicians", "Alumni of Clare College, Cambridge", "Fellows of Clare College, Cambridge", "Alumni of the University of Oxford", "Fellows of Balliol College, Oxford", "Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford", "Fellows of New College, Oxford", "Female Fellows of the Royal Society", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Members of Academia Europaea", "Harvard Fellows", "People educated at Oxford High School, England", "Whitehead Prize winners", "British women academics", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Pages containing London Gazette template with parameter supp set to y", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use British English from November 2015", "Use dmy dates from June 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Date of birth missing (living people)", "Place of birth missing (living people)"], "raw": "British mathematician\n\n\nDameFrances KirwanDBE FRSKirwan in 2009Born1959 (age\u00a061\u201362)NationalityBritishAlma\u00a0materUniversity of CambridgeAwardsWhitehead Prize (1989)Senior Whitehead Prize (2013)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of OxfordDoctoral advisorMichael Atiyah\n\nDame Frances Clare Kirwan, DBE FRS (born 1959) is a British mathematician, currently Savilian Professor of Geometry at the University of Oxford.
