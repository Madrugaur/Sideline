In particular, the upper bound for the absolute constant in the classical Berry-Esseen inequality is refined, and two-sided estimates for asymptotically regular constants in the Berry-Essen inequality are obtained in the absence of the third moment.[3]\n ", "tags": ["Russian computer scientists", "Russian women computer scientists", "Russian mathematicians", "Living people", "Moscow State University faculty", "1983 births", "Moscow State University alumni", "Articles with Russian-language sources (ru)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with topics of unclear notability from May 2018", "All articles with topics of unclear notability", "Academics articles with topics of unclear notability", "Articles lacking reliable references from May 2018", "All articles lacking reliable references", "BLP articles lacking sources from May 2018", "Wikipedia articles with possible conflicts of interest from July 2018", "Articles to be expanded from May 2018", "All articles to be expanded", "Biography articles needing translation from Russian Wikipedia", "Articles with multiple maintenance issues", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Russian mathematician\nThis article has multiple issues.
