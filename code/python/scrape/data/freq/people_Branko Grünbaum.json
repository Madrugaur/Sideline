{"name": "Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum", "content": "Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05e8\u05e0\u05e7\u05d5 \u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05dd\u200e; 2 October 1929 \u2013 14 September 2018)[1] was a Yugoslavian-born mathematician of Jewish descent[2] and a professor emeritus at the University of Washington in Seattle.  He received his Ph.D. in 1957 from Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel.[3]\n Gr\u00fcnbaum was born in Osijek, then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, on 2 October 1929. His father was Jewish and his mother was Catholic, so during World War II the family survived the holocaust by living at his Catholic grandmother's home. After the war, as a high school student, he met Zdenka Bienenstock, a Jew who had lived through the war hidden in a convent while most of her family were killed. Gr\u00fcnbaum became a student at the University of Zagreb, but grew disenchanted with the communist ideology of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, applied for emigration to Israel, and traveled with his family and Zdenka to Haifa in 1949.[4]\n In Israel, Gr\u00fcnbaum found a job in Tel Aviv, but in 1950 returned to the study of mathematics,[4] at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.[1] He earned a master's degree in 1954 and in the same year married Zdenka, who continued as a master's student in chemistry. He served a tour of duty as an operations researcher in the  Israeli Air Force beginning in 1955, and he and Zdenka had the first of their two sons in 1956.[4] He completed his Ph.D. in 1957;[4][3] his dissertation concerned convex geometry and was supervised by Aryeh Dvoretzky.[3]\n After finishing his military service in 1958, Gr\u00fcnbaum and his family came to the US so that Gr\u00fcnbaum could become a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study. He then became a visiting researcher at the University of Washington in 1960.\nHe agreed to return to Israel as a lecturer at the Hebrew University, but his plans were disrupted by the Israeli authorities determining that he was not a Jew (because his mother was not Jewish) and annulling his marriage; he and Zdenka remarried in Seattle before their return.[4]\n Gr\u00fcnbaum remained affiliated with the Hebrew University until 1966, taking long research visits to the University of Washington and in 1965\u20131966 to Michigan State University. However, during the Michigan visit, learning of another case similar to their marriage annulment, he and Zdenka decided to stay in the US instead of returning to Israel, where Zdenka was still a doctoral student in chemistry. Gr\u00fcnbaum was given a full professorship at the University of Washington in 1966, and he remained there until retiring in 2001.[4]\n Gr\u00fcnbaum authored over 200 papers, mostly in discrete geometry, an area in which he is known for various classification theorems. He wrote on the theory of abstract polyhedra.\n His paper on line arrangements may have inspired a paper by N. G. de Bruijn on quasiperiodic tilings (the most famous example of which is the Penrose tiling of the plane).  This paper is also cited by the authors of a monograph on hyperplane arrangements as having inspired their research.\n Gr\u00fcnbaum also devised a multi-set generalisation of Venn diagrams.  He was an editor and a frequent contributor to Geombinatorics.\n Gr\u00fcnbaum's classic monograph Convex Polytopes, first published in 1967, became the main textbook on the subject.  His monograph Tilings and Patterns, coauthored with G. C. Shephard, helped to rejuvenate interest in this classic field, and has proved popular with nonmathematical audiences, as well as with mathematicians.\n In 1976 Gr\u00fcnbaum won a Lester R. Ford Award for his expository article Venn diagrams and independent families of sets.[5] In 2004, Gil Kalai and Victor Klee edited a special issue of Discrete and Computational Geometry in his honor, the \"Gr\u00fcnbaum Festschrift\". In 2005, Gr\u00fcnbaum was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition from the American Mathematical Society. He was a Guggenheim Fellow, a Fellow of the AAAS and in 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[6][7]\nGr\u00fcnbaum supervised 19 Ph.D.s and currently has at least 200 mathematical descendants.[3]\n ", "tags": ["1929 births", "2018 deaths", "People from Osijek", "Yugoslav emigrants to Israel", "American people of Yugoslav descent", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Combinatorialists", "University of Washington faculty", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni", "Geometers", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science", "American textbook writers", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "CS1 maint: untitled periodical", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Yugoslav American mathematician\nBranko Gr\u00fcnbaumBranko Gr\u00fcnbaum in 1975Born2 October 1929Osijek, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, (now Croatia)Died14 September 2018(2018-09-14) (aged\u00a088)Seattle, Washington, U.S.NationalityYugoslav AmericanAlma\u00a0materHebrew University of JerusalemAwardsLester R.
