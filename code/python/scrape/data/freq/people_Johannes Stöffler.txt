{"name": "Johannes St\u00f6ffler", "content": "Johannes St\u00f6ffler (also St\u00f6fler, Stoffler, Stoeffler; 10 December 1452 \u2013 16 February 1531) was a German mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, priest, maker of astronomical instruments and professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen.\n Johannes St\u00f6ffler was born on 10 December 1452, in Justingen (now part of Schelklingen) on the Swabian Alb. Having received his basic education at the Blaubeuren monastery school, he registered at the newly founded University of Ingolstadt on 21 April 1472, where he was consequently promoted Baccalaureus in September 1473 and Magister in January 1476. After finishing his studies he obtained the parish of Justingen where he, besides his clerical obligations, concerned himself with astronomy, astrology and the making of astronomical instruments, clocks and celestial globes. He conducted a lively correspondence with leading humanists - for example, Johannes Reuchlin, for whom he made an equatorium and wrote horoscopes.\n In 1499 he predicted that a deluge would cover the world on 20 February 1524.[1] In 1507, at the instigation of Duke Ulrich I he received the newly established chair of mathematics and astronomy at the University of T\u00fcbingen, where he excelled in rich teaching and publication activities and finally was elected rector in 1522. By the time of his appointment he already enjoyed a virtual monopoly in ephemeris-making in collaboration with Jacob Pflaum, continuing the calculations of Regiomontanus through 1531, and then through 1551, the latter being published posthumously in 1531.[2]\n His treatise on the construction and the use of the astrolabe, entitled Elucidatio fabricae ususque astrolabii, was published in several editions and served astronomers and surveyors for a long time as a standard work.[3]\n Philipp Melanchthon and Sebastian M\u00fcnster rank among his most famous students. When a plague epidemic forced the division and relocation of his university to the surrounding countryside in 1530, St\u00f6ffler went to Blaubeuren and died there on 16 February 1531 of the plague. He was buried in the choir of the collegiate church (Stiftskirche) in T\u00fcbingen.\n The lunar crater \"St\u00f6fler\" (with one f) was named in his honour.\n ", "tags": ["1452 births", "1531 deaths", "People from Schelklingen", "German astrologers", "Medieval German astronomers", "Medieval German mathematicians", "15th-century apocalypticists", "15th-century astrologers", "16th-century apocalypticists", "16th-century astrologers", "15th-century German mathematicians", "Flood myths", "16th-century German mathematicians", "University of T\u00fcbingen faculty", "16th-century deaths from plague (disease)", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DSI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": " Johannes St\u00f6ffler (Ioannes Stoflerus)\nJohannes St\u00f6ffler (also St\u00f6fler, Stoffler, Stoeffler; 10 December 1452 \u2013 16 February 1531) was a German mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, priest, maker of astronomical instruments and professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Works\n3 Legacy\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nLife[edit]\nJohannes St\u00f6ffler was born on 10 December 1452, in Justingen (now part of Schelklingen) on the Swabian Alb.
