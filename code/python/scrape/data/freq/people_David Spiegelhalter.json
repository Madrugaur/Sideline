He has been an honorary lecturer at the University of Hong Kong since 1991. He has also been a consultant for GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and the World Anti-Doping Agency. He played a leading role in the public inquiries into children's heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary and the murders by Harold Shipman.[12]\n Between 2007 and 2012 he divided his work[13] between the Cambridge Statistical Laboratory (three-fifths) and the Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit (two-fifths).[14] He left the MRC in March 2012[15] and worked full-time at the Statistical Laboratory as the Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk until his retirement.

He wrote several papers in the 1980s that showed how probability could be incorporated into expert systems, a problem that seemed intractable at the time. Spiegelhalter showed that while frequentist probability did not lend itself to expert systems, Bayesian probability most certainly did.[23]\nStatistical software.[24] In the 1990s Spiegelhalter led the Medical Research Council team that developed WinBUGS (\"Bayesian analysis Using Gibbs Sampling\"), a statistical-modelling system allowing hierarchical prior distributions. WinBUGS and its successor OpenBUGS specifies graphical models using acyclic directed graphs whose nodes are random variables, which are updated using Gibbs sampling (an updating method for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation).[25] Earlier Bayesian software had required that the probability distribution for the observed data be an exponential family and that the prior be its conjugate distribution. Allowing flexible choices of prior distributions simplified hierarchical modelling and helped to promote multilevel models, which became widely used in epidemiology and education.\nGeneral issues in clinical trials,[26] including cluster randomisation, meta-analysis and ethical monitoring.\nMonitoring and comparing clinical and public-health outcomes and their associated publication as performance indicators.\nPublic understanding of risk,[27][28] including promoting concepts such as the micromort (a one in a million chance of death) and microlife (a 30-minute reduction of life expectancy). Media reporting of statistics,[29] risk and probability and the wider conception of uncertainty as going beyond what is measured to model uncertainty, the unknown and the unmeasurable.\nHonours[edit]\n1975 Fellow, Royal Statistical Society\n1985 Guy Medal in Bronze, Royal Statistical Society\n1990 Award for Outstanding Statistical Application, American Statistical Association[30]\n1993 Chartered Statistician, Royal Statistical Society[dubious  \u2013 discuss]\n1994 Guy Medal in Silver, Royal Statistical Society\n1994 Honorary Doctorate, Aalborg University, Denmark\n2005 Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS)\n2006 Received an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours\n2006 Appointed Honorary Professor of Biostatistics at University of Cambridge\n2009 Weldon Memorial Prize and Medal[31]\n2010 Honorary Doctorate of Science, Plymouth University\n2013 Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University [32]\n2020 Guy Medal in Gold, Royal Statistical Society[33]\n2020 Michael Faraday Prize of the Royal Society\nSpiegelhalter was knighted in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to statistics.[34][35]\n\nMedia appearances[edit]\nHorizon - To Infinity and Beyond (10 February 2010)\nThe Joy of Stats (7 December 2010)\nHorizon - What is One Degree?
