By his own estimation, Luke reviewed over 1,800 papers and books throughout his career.\n Yudell Luke was born in Kansas City, Missouri, U.S. on 26 June 1918 to Jewish parents.[1] His father, David Luke, was sexton of Congregation Kerem Israel Beth Shalom. The young Luke attended the Kansas City Missouri Junior College, graduating in 1937. He read mathematics at the University of Illinois, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1939, and a Masters the following year. He then taught at the university for two years, but was called up for World War II military service in 1942.\n Luke served in the United States Navy until 1946 and was stationed in Hawaii for the duration of the war. After his service, he returned to the university, where he met his future wife LaVerne (LaVerne B. (n\u00e9e Podolsky), 1922\u20132004) at the University of Illinois. They moved to Kansas City in 1946 and had four daughters, Molly, Janis, Linda, and Debra, and established the Yudell and LaVerne Luke Senior Adult Transportation Fund at the Kansas City Jewish Community Center.[1]\n Soon after Luke moved to Kansas City, he was appointed to MRIGlobal (formerly Midwest Research Institute). His first position was as Head of the Mathematical Analysis Section, a position he held until his promotion to Senior Advisor for Mathematics in 1961. Luke also held posts at other universities. In 1955, he became a lecturer at the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City, and he also taught at the University of Kansas. After the mathematics group of MRIGlobal was disbanded in 1971, Luke was appointed professor at the University of Missouri, and in 1975, received the N T Veatch award for Distinguished Research and Creative Activity. He then became Curator's Professor at Missouri in 1978.\n In 1982, an exchange programme between the University of Missouri and the University of Moscow was formed, and the following year, Luke travelled to Moscow to lecture on a series of topics as part of the programme, including special functions, asymptotic analysis and approximation theory. He died while in Russia on 6 May 1983.\n Luke had a wide range of interests outside mathematics, including basketball, baseball, bridge, and cribbage. He wrote two books on the probabilities of winning at the latter.[2] He also expressed interest in opera and philosophy, and once gave a series of lectures on the history of philosophy, mainly focusing on Baruch Spinoza's ideas.\n ", "tags": ["1918 births", "1983 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Jewish scientists", "Mathematicians from Missouri", "Scientists from Missouri", "University of Missouri faculty", "Scientists from Kansas City, Missouri", "University of Missouri mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from December 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\n\n\nYudell LukeBorn(1918-06-26)26 June 1918Kansas City, Missouri, United StatesDied(1983-05-06)6 May 1983Moscow, RussiaCitizenshipAmericanKnown\u00a0forSpecial functionsHypergeometric functionsAwardsN T Veatch award for Distinguished Research and Creative ActivityScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of Missouri\n\nYudell Leo Luke (26 June 1918 \u2013 6 May 1983) was an American mathematician who made significant contributions to MRIGlobal, was awarded the N.
