{"name": "Erich K\u00e4hler", "content": "Erich K\u00e4hler (German: [\u02c8k\u025b\u02d0l\u0250] (listen); 16 January 1906 \u2013 31 May 2000) was a German mathematician with wide-ranging interests in geometry and mathematical physics, who laid important mathematical groundwork for algebraic geometry and for string theory.\n Erich K\u00e4hler was born in Leipzig, the son of a telegraph inspector Ernst K\u00e4hler. Inspired as a boy to be an explorer after reading books about Sven Hedin that his mother Elsa G\u00f6tsch had given to him, the young K\u00e4hler soon focused his passion for exploration on astronomy. He is said to have written a 50-page thesis on fractional differentiation while still in high school, hoping that it would earn him a PhD. His teachers replied that he would have to attend university courses first.[1]\n K\u00e4hler enrolled in the University of Leipzig in 1924. He read Galois theory, met the mathematician Emil Artin, and did research under the supervision of Leon Lichtenstein. Still fascinated by celestial mechanics, K\u00e4hler wrote a dissertation entitled On the existence of equilibrium solutions of rotating liquids, which are derived from certain solutions of the n-body problem, and received his doctorate in 1928.[2] He continued his studies at Leipzig for the following year, supported by fellowship from the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaften, except for a research assistantship at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg in 1929. In 1930 K\u00e4hler joined the Department of Mathematics at the University of Hamburg to work under the direction of Wilhelm Blaschke, writing a habilitation thesis entitled, \"About the integrals of algebraic equations\". He took a year in Rome to work with Italian geometers including Enriques, Castelnuovo, Levi-Civita, Severi, and Segre in 1931-1932,[1] which led him to publish his acclaimed work on what are now called K\u00e4hler metrics in 1932.[3] K\u00e4hler returned to Hamburg after his year in Rome, where he continued to work until going to the University of Konigsberg in 1935, and was offered an ordinary professorship a year later. In 1938 he married his first wife Luise G\u00fcnther.[1]\n In the years leading up to World War II K\u00e4hler was a supporter of Hitler and of German nationalism, and reported that he volunteered for the German military in 1935, joined the navy in 1937, and the army on 24 August 1939 before the invasion of Poland.[4] After being stationed at the Saint-Nazaire submarine base in German Occupied France towards the end of the war, K\u00e4hler was captured by the Allies and taken to the prisoner of war camp at Ile de R\u00e9, and then to another camp in Mulsanne. Thanks to the French mathematicians Frederic Joliot-Curie and \u00c9lie Cartan, K\u00e4hler was able to study mathematics during this time, receiving books and mathematics papers and working during his imprisonment. He was released in 1947.[5] He reported that his oath to Hitler (as a civil servant) was important to him, and remained an apologist for the Third Reich decades later, in a 1988 interview with Sanford Segal.[4] A former student reported in 1988 that he kept a Nazi navy flag in his office.[4]\n After his release as a prisoner of war K\u00e4hler returned to the University of Hamburg to take up a temporary lectureship. He accepted a professorship in 1948 at his alma mater the University of Leipzig, filling a post that had been left open by the death of Paul Koebe in 1945. But in this same year, Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative in the region to German communist leaders, and from October 1949 the region was a part of newly-formed East Germany. K\u00e4hler became increasingly unhappy with life in East Germany over the next decade, finally deciding to leave in 1958 to take up a lectureship at the Technical University of Berlin. There he was heralded as among the greatest living mathematicians, and his lectures overflowed with 600 students from engineering and the sciences.[6] In 1964 he returned to the University of Hamburg to fill the post that opened when Artin died in 1962. His wife Luise became ill and died in 1970, and K\u00e4hler married his second wife Charlotte Schulze, who was the widow of his brother who had died in the war. K\u00e4hler remained at the University of Hamburg until his retirement in 1974.[1]\n After retiring K\u00e4hler remained an active researcher, writing a number of important papers on the foundations of physics and the Poincar\u00e9 group, as well as a number of philosophical papers.[5]\n As a mathematician K\u00e4hler is known for a number of contributions: the Cartan\u2013K\u00e4hler theorem on solutions of non-linear analytic differential systems; the idea of a K\u00e4hler metric on complex manifolds; and the K\u00e4hler differentials, which provide a purely algebraic theory and have generally been adopted in algebraic geometry. In all of these the theory of differential forms plays a part, and K\u00e4hler counts as a major developer of the theory from its formal genesis with \u00c9lie Cartan.\n K\u00e4hler manifolds \u2014 complex manifolds endowed with a Riemannian metric and a symplectic form so that the three structures are mutually compatible \u2014 are named after him.\n The K3 surface is named after Kummer, K\u00e4hler, and Kodaira.\n His earlier work was on celestial mechanics; and he was one of the forerunners of scheme theory, though his ideas on that were never widely adopted.\n ", "tags": ["1906 births", "2000 deaths", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Algebraic geometers", "Scientists from Leipzig", "People from the Kingdom of Saxony", "University of K\u00f6nigsberg alumni", "Leipzig University alumni", "Leipzig University faculty", "Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with hAudio microformats", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article is about the German mathematician.
