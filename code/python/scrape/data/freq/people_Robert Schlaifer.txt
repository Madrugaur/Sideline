His work and his character are described in the following appreciations.\nIn 1992 the Decision Analysis Society awarded Schlaifer the Frank P. Ramsey Medal for distinguished contributions to the field of decision analysis. In making the award Bob Winkler noted Schlaifer's pioneering efforts in decision analysis.\n\nHis 1959 book, Probability and Statistics for Business Decisions, was a landmark effort, coming only five years after L. J. Savage, in his classic Foundations of Statistics, presented a development of subjective probability and utility but then inexplicably reverted to minimax arguments in the latter part of the book. Schlaifer, with no formal training in statistics or mathematical modeling, got it right and took the first steps toward bridging the theory/practice gap.\nWinkler also quoted the following assessment from Howard Raiffa, who worked with Schlaifer and was the recipient of the first Ramsey Medal in 1984:\n\n\u201cThe basic ideas of statistical decision theory were conceived by (Schlaifer) independently of the work of L. J. Savage  or de Finetti, and early on he saw that those ideas were broadly applicable to problems in decision making under uncertainty. He was a pioneer in the practical assessment of subjective probabilities and utilities\u2026 (Schlaifer) influenced my intellectual development more than any other individual \u2014 more than Abraham Wald or von Neumann or Savage or Arrow.\u201d\nIn the preface to the second 1971 edition of Foundations of Statistics Savage wrote\n\nThis is a welcome opportunity to say that his [Schlaifer's] ideas were developed wholly independently of the present book, and indeed of other personalistic literature. They are in full harmony with the ideas of this book but are more down to earth and less spellbound by tradition.\nSchlaifer's book with John W. Pratt and Raiffa was published posthumously and his co-authors wrote this dedication:\n\nRobert O. Schlaifer (1915 \u2013 1994): An original, deep, creative, indefatigable, persistent, versatile, demanding, sometimes irascible scholar, who was an inspiration to us both.\nRole in development of aircraft engines & fuels[edit]\nSchlaifer was involved in the development of military aircraft engines and fuels prior to World War II. He found that the best way to get a good engine quickly was to bring to test as soon as possible a number of alternate designs, pick one that combined good characteristics with few development problems, and then work intensely to develop it.[3]\n\nSome publications of Robert Schlaifer[edit]\nGreek Theories of Slavery from Homer to Aristotle, Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Vol. 47 (1936), pp.\u00a0165\u2013204.\nDemon of Paeania, Priest of Asclepius, Classical Philology, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Jan., 1943), pp.\u00a039\u201343.\nDevelopment of Aircraft Engines.
