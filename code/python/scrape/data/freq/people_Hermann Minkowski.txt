{"name": "Hermann Minkowski", "content": "\n Hermann Minkowski (/m\u026a\u014b\u02c8k\u0254\u02d0fski, -\u02c8k\u0252f-/;[2] German: [m\u026a\u014b\u02c8k\u0254fski]; 22 June 1864 \u2013 12 January 1909) was a mathematician and professor at K\u00f6nigsberg, Z\u00fcrich and G\u00f6ttingen. In different sources Minkowski's nationality is variously given as German,[3][4][5] Polish,[6][7][8] or Lithuanian-German,[9] or Russian.[10] He created and developed the geometry of numbers and used geometrical methods to solve problems in number theory, mathematical physics, and the theory of relativity.\n Minkowski is perhaps best known for his work in relativity, in which he showed in 1907 that his former student Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity (1905) could  be understood geometrically as a theory of four-dimensional space\u2013time, since known as the \"Minkowski spacetime\".\n Hermann Minkowski was born in the town of Aleksota, the Suwa\u0142ki Governorate, the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire, to Lewin Boruch Minkowski, a merchant who subsidized the building of the choral synagogue in Kovno,[11][12][13] and Rachel Taubmann, both of Jewish descent.[14] Hermann was a younger brother of the medical researcher Oskar (born 1858).[15]\n To escape persecution in the Russian Empire the family moved to K\u00f6nigsberg in 1872,[16] where the father became involved in rag export and later in manufacture of mechanical clockwork tin toys (he operated his firm Lewin Minkowski & Son with his eldest son Max).[17]\n Minkowski studied in K\u00f6nigsberg and taught in Bonn (1887\u20131894), K\u00f6nigsberg (1894\u20131896) and Zurich (1896\u20131902), and finally in G\u00f6ttingen from 1902 until his death in 1909. He married Auguste Adler in 1897 with whom he had two daughters; the electrical engineer and inventor Reinhold Rudenberg was his son-in-law.\n Minkowski died suddenly of appendicitis in G\u00f6ttingen on 12 January 1909. David Hilbert's obituary of Minkowski illustrates the deep friendship between the two mathematicians (translated):\n Max Born delivered the obituary on behalf of the mathematics students at G\u00f6ttingen.[18]\n The main-belt asteroid 12493 Minkowski and M-matrices are named in Minkowski's honor.[19]\n Minkowski was educated in East Prussia at the Albertina University of K\u00f6nigsberg, where he earned his doctorate in 1885 under the direction of Ferdinand von Lindemann. In 1883, while still a student at K\u00f6nigsberg, he was awarded the Mathematics Prize of the French Academy of Sciences for his manuscript on the theory of quadratic forms. He also became a friend of another renowned mathematician, David Hilbert. His brother, Oskar Minkowski (1858\u20131931), was a well-known physician and researcher.[16]\n Minkowski taught at the universities of Bonn, K\u00f6nigsberg, Z\u00fcrich, and G\u00f6ttingen. At the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Polytechnikum, today the ETH Zurich, he was one of Einstein's teachers.\n Minkowski explored the arithmetic of quadratic forms, especially concerning n variables, and his research into that topic led him to consider certain geometric properties in a space of n dimensions. In 1896, he presented his geometry of numbers, a geometrical method that solved problems in number theory. He is also the creator of the Minkowski Sausage and the Minkowski cover of a curve.[20]\n In 1902, he joined the Mathematics Department of G\u00f6ttingen and became a close colleague of David Hilbert, whom he first met at university in K\u00f6nigsberg.  Constantin Carath\u00e9odory was one of his students there.\n By 1908 Minkowski realized that the special theory of relativity, introduced by his former student Albert Einstein in 1905 and based on the previous work of Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9, could best be understood in a four-dimensional space, since known as the \"Minkowski spacetime\", in which time and space are not separated entities but intermingled in a four-dimensional space\u2013time, and in which the Lorentz geometry of special relativity can be effectively represented using the invariant interval \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nz\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\nt\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}}\n\n (see History of special relativity).\n The mathematical basis of Minkowski space can also be found in the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space already known in the 19th century, because isometries (or motions) in hyperbolic space can be related to Lorentz transformations, which included contributions of Wilhelm Killing (1880, 1885), Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1881), Homersham Cox (1881), Alexander Macfarlane (1894) and others (see History of Lorentz transformations).\n The beginning part of his address called \"Space and Time\" delivered at the 80th Assembly of German Natural Scientists and Physicians (21 September 1908) is now famous:\n The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength.

Our science, which we loved above all else, brought us together; it seemed to us a garden full of flowers.  In it, we enjoyed looking for hidden pathways and discovered many a new perspective that appealed to our sense of beauty, and when one of us showed it to the other and we marveled over it together, our joy was complete.  He was for me a rare gift from heaven and I must be grateful to have possessed that gift for so long.  Now death has suddenly torn him from our midst.  However, what death cannot take away is his noble image in our hearts and the knowledge that his spirit continues to be active in us.\nMax Born delivered the obituary on behalf of the mathematics students at G\u00f6ttingen.[18]\nThe main-belt asteroid 12493 Minkowski and M-matrices are named in Minkowski's honor.[19]\n\nEducation and career[edit]\n Minkowski in 1883, at the time of being awarded the Mathematics Prize of the French Academy of Sciences\nMinkowski was educated in East Prussia at the Albertina University of K\u00f6nigsberg, where he earned his doctorate in 1885 under the direction of Ferdinand von Lindemann.
