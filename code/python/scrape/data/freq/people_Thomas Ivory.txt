He then leased a piece of  land on the west forecourt of the Great Hospital on which he built a substantial residence for himself, into which he moved in 1756.[1] It is now known as St Helen's House. He went on to build the Assembly House (1754), the neighbouring theatre  (1757, since destroyed),[3]  the Methodist meeting-house  in Bishopsgate Street (1752\u20133), [4] the Octagon Chapel in Colegate (1754\u20136) and the artillery barracks (1771).
