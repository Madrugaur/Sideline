{"name": "Jeanne LaDuke", "content": "Alice Jeanne LaDuke (born June 27, 1938) is an American  mathematician who specialized in mathematical analysis and the history of mathematics. She was also a child actress who appeared in one film (The Green Promise).\n LaDuke was raised on a farm in Posey County,[1] in southwest Indiana. Her parents were college-educated and an aunt who taught mathematics in Chicago frequently visited, bringing mathematics puzzles for LaDuke.[2]\n As a child, she was cast from a field of 12,000 4-H members to play a small part in The Green Promise (1948)[1] as farm girl Jessie Wexford, the sister of Natalie Wood's character's love interest.[3] Wood and LaDuke shared a tutor who taught them both string games as well as their school curriculum.[4]\n LaDuke studied mathematics at DePauw University in the 1950s, and roomed with another mathematics major from Oregon, who showed her the state on summer camping trips.[2]\n She earned a master's degree in mathematics, but was unable to obtain a teaching position with it because the schools she applied to only hired men. She returned to Oregon in 1966 as a doctoral student at the University of Oregon,[2] and completed her Ph.D. in 1969 with a dissertation in mathematical analysis supervised by Kenneth A. Ross on Ep Space: Essentially a Product of Cp Spaces.[5]\n After completing her doctorate, LaDuke spent the following thirty years as a faculty member of the department of mathematical sciences at DePaul University.[2] She retired in 2003.[6]\n With Judy Green, she is the author of Pioneering Women in American Mathematics: The Pre-1940 PhD\u2019s (American Mathematical Society and London Mathematical Society, 2009).[7] An annual lecture series on Women in Mathematics, Science, and Technology at DePaul is named after her.[8]\n ", "tags": ["1938 births", "Living people", "People from Posey County, Indiana", "American child actresses", "20th-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "Mathematical analysts", "Historians of mathematics", "DePauw University alumni", "University of Oregon alumni", "DePaul University faculty", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nAlice Jeanne LaDuke (born June 27, 1938) is an American  mathematician who specialized in mathematical analysis and the history of mathematics.
