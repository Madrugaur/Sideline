{"name": "Stanis\u0142aw Saks", "content": "Stanis\u0142aw Saks (30 December 1897 \u2013 23 November 1942) was a Polish mathematician and university tutor, a member of the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics, known primarily for his membership in the Scottish Caf\u00e9 circle, an extensive monograph on the theory of integrals, his works on measure theory and the Vitali\u2013Hahn\u2013Saks theorem.\n Stanis\u0142aw Saks was born on 30 December 1897 in Kalisz, Congress Poland, to an assimilated Polish-Jewish family. In 1915 he graduated from a local gymnasium and joined the newly recreated Warsaw University. In 1922 he received a doctorate of his alma mater with a prestigious award Cum Maxima Laude. Soon afterwards he also passed his habilitation and received the Rockefeller scholarship, which allowed him to travel to the United States. Around that time he started publishing articles in various mathematical journals, mostly the Fundamenta Mathematicae, but also in the American Transactions of the American Mathematical Society. He participated in the Silesian Uprisings and was awarded the Cross of the Valorous and the Medal of Independence for his bravery. Following the end of the uprising he returned to Warsaw and resumed his academic career.\n For most of it he studied the theories of functions and functionals in particular. In 1930 he published his most notable book, the Zarys teorii ca\u0142ki (Sketch on the Theory of the Integral), which later got expanded and translated into several languages, including English (Theory of the Integral), French (Th\u00e9orie de l'Int\u00e9grale)[1] and Russian (Teoriya Integrala). Despite his successes, Saks was never awarded with the title of a professor and remained an ordinary tutor, initially at his alma mater and the Warsaw University of Technology, and later at the Lw\u00f3w University and Wilno University. He was also an active socialist and a journalist at the Robotnik weekly (1919-1926) and later a collaborator of the Association of Socialist Youth.\n Saks wrote a mathematics book with Antoni Zygmund, Analytic Functions, in 1933.  It was translated into English in 1952 by E. J. Scott.[2]  In the preface to the English edition, Zygmund writes:[3]\n Stanislaw Saks was a man of moral as well as physical courage, of rare intelligence and wit.  To his colleagues and pupils he was an inspiration not only as a mathematician but as a human being.  In the period between the two world wars he exerted great influence upon a whole generation of Polish mathematicians in Warsaw and Lw\u00f3w.  In November 1942, at the age of 45, Saks died in a Warsaw prison, victim of a policy of extermination.\n After the outbreak of World War II and the occupation of Poland by Germany, Saks joined the Polish underground. Arrested in November 1942, he was executed on 23 November 1942 by the German Gestapo in Warsaw.[4]\n ", "tags": ["Functional analysts", "Measure theorists", "1887 births", "1942 deaths", "20th-century mathematicians", "Mathematical analysts", "Polish mathematicians", "University of Warsaw alumni", "People from Kalisz", "Vilnius University faculty", "Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Polish mathematician (1897-1942)\nStanis\u0142aw SaksBorn(1897-12-30)30 December 1897Kalisz, Congress PolandDied23 November 1942(1942-11-23) (aged\u00a044)Warsaw, German-occupied PolandCause\u00a0of deathExecutionNationalityPolishAlma\u00a0materWarsaw UniversityKnown\u00a0forVitali\u2013Hahn\u2013Saks theoremDenjoy\u2013Luzin\u2013Saks theoremDenjoy\u2013Young\u2013Saks theoremScientific careerFieldsMathematics\n\nStanis\u0142aw Saks (30 December 1897 \u2013 23 November 1942) was a Polish mathematician and university tutor, a member of the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics, known primarily for his membership in the Scottish Caf\u00e9 circle, an extensive monograph on the theory of integrals, his works on measure theory and the Vitali\u2013Hahn\u2013Saks theorem.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and work\n2 Publications\n3 See also\n4 Notes\n5 References\n\n\nLife and work[edit]\nStanis\u0142aw Saks was born on 30 December 1897 in Kalisz, Congress Poland, to an assimilated Polish-Jewish family.
