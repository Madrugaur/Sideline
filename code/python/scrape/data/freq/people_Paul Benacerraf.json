{"name": "Paul Benacerraf", "content": "Paul Joseph Salomon Benacerraf (/b\u026a\u02c8n\u00e6s\u0259r\u0259f/; born 26 March 1931)[2][3] is a French-born American philosopher working in the field of the philosophy of mathematics who has been teaching at Princeton University since he joined the faculty in 1960.  He was appointed Stuart Professor of Philosophy in 1974, and retired in 2007 as the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Philosophy.[4]\n Benacerraf was born in Paris to parents who were Sephardi Jews from Morocco and Algeria. In 1939 the family moved to Caracas and then to New York City.[5]\n When the family returned to Caracas, Benacerraf remained in the United States, boarding at the Peddie School in Hightstown, NJ. He attended Princeton University for both his undergraduate and graduate studies.[5]\n He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1998.[3]\n His brother was the Venezuelan Nobel Prize-winning immunologist Baruj Benacerraf.\n Benacerraf is perhaps best known for his two papers \"What Numbers Could Not Be\" (1965) and \"Mathematical Truth\" (1973), and for his anthology on the philosophy of mathematics, co-edited with Hilary Putnam. \n In \"What Numbers Could Not Be\" (1965), Benacerraf argues against a Platonist view of mathematics, and for structuralism, on the ground that what is important about numbers is the abstract structures they represent rather than the objects that number words ostensibly refer to.  In particular, this argument is based on the point that Ernst Zermelo and John von Neumann give distinct, and completely adequate, identifications of natural numbers with sets (see Zermelo ordinals and von Neumann ordinals). This argument is called Benacerraf's identification problem.\n In \"Mathematical Truth\" (1973), he argues that no interpretation of mathematics offers a satisfactory package of epistemology and semantics; it is possible to explain mathematical truth in a way that is consistent with our syntactico-semantical treatment of truth in non-mathematical language, and it is possible to explain our knowledge of mathematics in terms consistent with a causal account of epistemology, but it is in general not possible to accomplish both of these objectives simultaneously (this argument is called Benacerraf's epistemological problem). He argues for this on the grounds that an adequate account of truth in mathematics implies the existence of abstract mathematical objects, but that such objects are epistemologically inaccessible because they are causally inert and beyond the reach of sense perception. On the other hand, an adequate epistemology of mathematics, say one that ties truth-conditions to proof in some way, precludes understanding how and why the truth-conditions have any bearing on truth.\n Elisabeth Lloyd has alleged that while she was a PhD student at Princeton, Benacerraf \"petted and touched\" her every day. She said, \"It was just an extra price I had to pay, that the men did not have to pay, in order to get my Ph.D.\"[6] Benacerraf has denied the allegations, stating in an email to The Chronicle, Mr. Benacerraf said he was \u201cgenuinely puzzled\u201d by the accusations and does not know what prompted them. \u201cI am not the sort of person that she describes in her interview,\u201d he said. \u201cYet I do not doubt her sincerity or the depth of the feelings that she reports,\u201d he added.[6]\n ", "tags": ["1931 births", "20th-century Sephardi Jews", "21st-century Sephardi Jews", "20th-century American philosophers", "21st-century American philosophers", "American people of Moroccan-Jewish descent", "American logicians", "Analytic philosophers", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Jewish philosophers", "Living people", "Mathematical logicians", "Metaphysicians", "French expatriates in Venezuela", "Peddie School alumni", "Philosophers of mathematics", "Princeton University faculty", "Structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)", "Writers from Paris", "American metaphysics writers", "French male writers", "French emigrants to the United States", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Paul BenacerrafBorn1931Paris, FranceEducationPrinceton University (PhD, 1960)EraContemporary philosophyRegionWestern philosophySchoolAnalytic philosophyThesisLogicism, Some Considerations\u00a0(1960)Doctoral advisorHilary PutnamDoctoral studentsJohn EarmanAlvin GoldmanRichard GrandyGideon RosenRonald de SousaMain interestsPhilosophy of mathematicsNotable ideasMathematical structuralism (eliminative variety)[1]Benacerraf's identification problem for set-theoretic realismBenacerraf's epistemological problem for mathematical realism\nInfluences\nHilary Putnam\n\nInfluenced\nPaul Boghossian, Ronald de Sousa, John Earman, Gideon Rosen, Lawrence Sklar\n\n\nPaul Joseph Salomon Benacerraf (/b\u026a\u02c8n\u00e6s\u0259r\u0259f/; born 26 March 1931)[2][3] is a French-born American philosopher working in the field of the philosophy of mathematics who has been teaching at Princeton University since he joined the faculty in 1960.
