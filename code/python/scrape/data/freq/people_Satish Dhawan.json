{"name": "Satish Dhawan", "content": "\n Satish Dhawan (25 September 1920\u00a0\u2013 3 January 2002) was an Indian mathematician and aerospace engineer, widely regarded as the father of experimental fluid dynamics research in India. Born in Srinagar, Dhawan was educated in India and further on in United States. Dhawan was one of the most eminent researchers in the field of turbulence and boundary layers, leading the successful and indigenous development of the Indian space programme. He succeeded M. G. K. Menon, as the third chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1972.\n Dhawan was a graduate of the University of the Punjab in Lahore, India (now in Pakistan), where he completed a Bachelor of Science in physics and mathematics, a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master of Arts in English literature. In 1947, he completed a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, and an aeronautical engineering degree from the California Institute of Technology followed by a double PhD in mathematics and aerospace engineering under the supervision of his advisor Hans W. Liepmann in 1951.\n In 1972 Dr Dhawan became chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and secretary to the Government of India at the Department of Space.\n APJ Abdul Kalam explained that in 1979 when he was the director of a Satellite Launch Vehicle, the mission failed to launch the satellite in the orbit. Instead, it was put into Bay of Bengal. Abdul Kalam's team knew that there was a leakage in the fuel of the system, but they hoped that the leakage was negligible, and thus they thought there was enough fuel in the system. This miscalculation lead to the failure. Satish Dhawan, being the chairman at the time, called Abdul Kalam and conveyed to the press; \"We failed! But I have very strong trust in my team and I believe that next time we will definitely succeed\". This surprised Abdul Kalam, as the blame of the failure was taken by the chairman of ISRO. The next mission was prepared and launched successfully in 1980. When this succeeded, Satish Dhawan told Abdul Kalam to attend the press meet without his presence. It was observed that when the team failed, he took the blame. But when the team succeeded, he attributed the success to his team, thus portraying the picture of an ideal leader.\n Satish Dhawan was chairman of ISRO until 1984.\n Dhawan joined as faculty at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, in 1951 and became its director in 1962. Although he was the head of the Indian space programme, he devoted substantial efforts towards boundary layer research. His most important contributions are presented in the seminal book Boundary Layer Theory by Hermann Schlichting. He set up the country's first supersonic wind tunnel at IISc. He also pioneered research on relaminarization of separated boundary layer flows, three-dimensional boundary layers and trisonic flows.[1]\n Dhawan carried out pioneering experiments in rural education, remote sensing and satellite communications. His efforts led to operational systems like INSAT, a telecommunications satellite; IRS, the Indian Remote Sensing satellite; and the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), that placed India in the league of space faring nations.[citation needed]\n Dhawan died on 3 January 2002 in Bangalore.[2] Following his death, the satellite launch centre at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, located about 100\u00a0km north of Chennai in South India, was renamed to the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. Satish Chander Dhawan Government College For Boys is named after him. \nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering Building at Indian Institute of Technology Ropar is also named after him as Satish Dhawan Block, IIT Ropar.\n Satish Dhawan was born on 25 September 1920 in Srinagar in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, India, in a Punjabi family. His father came from Dera Ismail Khan,[5] and Satish Dhawan grew up in Lahore and Kashmir. He was married to Nalini Dhawan, a cytogeneticist,  and his daughter Jyotsna Dhawan is a serving as Senior Principal Scientist in the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology.\n ", "tags": ["1920 births", "2002 deaths", "California Institute of Technology alumni", "Space programme of India", "Recipients of the Padma Vibhushan in science & engineering", "Indian Space Research Organisation people", "University of Minnesota College of Science and Engineering alumni", "Indian fluid dynamicists", "Recipients of the Padma Bhushan in science & engineering", "People from Srinagar", "University of the Punjab alumni", "Indian aerospace engineers", "Directors of the Indian Institute of Science", "Indian Institute of Science faculty", "Recipients of the Padma Shri in science & engineering", "20th-century Indian engineers", "Engineers from Jammu and Kashmir", "20th-century Indian physicists", "Fluid dynamicists", "Use dmy dates from April 2018", "Use Indian English from February 2017", "All Wikipedia articles written in Indian English", "Articles needing additional references from December 2019", "All articles needing additional references", "Biography with signature", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from April 2018", "Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
