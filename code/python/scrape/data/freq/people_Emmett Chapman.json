{"name": "Emmett Chapman", "content": "\n Emmett Chapman (born September 28, 1936) is an American jazz musician best known as the inventor of the Chapman Stick and maker of the Chapman Stick family of instruments.\n Chapman started his career as a guitarist, recording and performing in the late 1960s. He played with Barney Kessel and Tim Buckley before leading his own band.[1]\n In 1969, Chapman modified his homemade nine-string \"Freedom Guitar\" to accommodate his \"Free Hands\" tapping method. Although some guitarists had done two-handed tapping with the fingers of the right hand parallel to the strings, Chapman's method used the fingers of both hands perpendicular to the strings. This culminated in the creation of the Electric Stick, which he renamed the Chapman Stick.  He founded Stick Enterprises in 1974 and has made more than 6,000 instruments. He holds fourteen patents for various aspects of the Chapman Stick. During the 1970s, Chapman toured extensively to promote his music and the instrument.\n He was influenced by Barney Kessel, then John McLaughlin.[2]\n In 1985, he released a solo album, Parallel Galaxy. The song \"Back Yard\" was used in the Alan Smithee version of the 1984 film Dune. An aesthetically modified Chapman Stick was used as the baliset musical instrument, described in the novel, and is performed by Patrick Stewart in the director's cut of the film.[citation needed]\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "1936 births", "American jazz guitarists", "Chapman Stick players", "20th-century American guitarists", "Articles with short description", "Articles with short description added by PearBOT 5", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from December 2014", "BLP articles lacking sources from December 2011", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using Template:Infobox musical artist with unknown parameters", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from November 2020", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American jazz musician\n\n\nThis biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.
