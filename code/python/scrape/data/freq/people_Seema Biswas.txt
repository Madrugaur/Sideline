She shot into prominence with the role of Phoolan Devi in Shekhar Kapur's film Bandit Queen (1994), for which she won the National Film Award for Best Actress.[1] She won the 2000 Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and the 2006 Best Actress Genie Award for her role as Shakuntala in Deepa Mehta's Water (2005). Her other mainstream films include Khamoshi: The Musical (1996), for which she won the Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress, Bhoot (2003), Vivah (2006), and Half Girlfriend (2017). In addition to films, Biswas has been a part of many television shows.\n Biswas was born in Nalbari, Assam to Jagdish Biswas and Meera Biswas.[2] After completing her primary education, she graduated in Political Science Honours from Nalbari College, Assam. She studied Dramatic Arts at National School of Drama, New Delhi.[3][citation needed]\n Seema Biswas acted as the heroine in Krishnan Kartha's Amshini (Hindi) which entered the Indian Panorama Section of Filmotsav 1988.
