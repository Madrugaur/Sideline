She specialised in algebraic topology and earned a master's degree. Originally intending to go into secondary-school education, she was instead persuaded by the department head, professor J. T. Campbell, to become a lecturer in mathematics at Victoria University of Wellington in 1965. She married another new lecturer in mathematics, Ken Pledger, in 1967, and gave up her lecturership in 1970 soon before the birth of their first child.[3]\n A few years later she returned to academia as an instructor in statistics at Wellington Polytechnic and in 1980 she obtained a lecturer position in statistics at Victoria University of Wellington.
