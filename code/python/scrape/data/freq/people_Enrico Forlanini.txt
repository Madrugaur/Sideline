{"name": "Enrico Forlanini", "content": "Enrico Forlanini (13 December 1848[1] \u2013 9 October 1930) was an Italian engineer, inventor and aeronautical pioneer, known for his works on helicopters, aircraft, hydrofoils and dirigibles. He was born in Milan. His older brother Carlo Forlanini was a  physician.[1]\n Enrico was born to Francesco Forlanini, a notable physician and director of the Ospedale Fatebenefratelli in Milan. After elementary school he attended one of the three Milan Regie Scuole Tecniche, in 1863 he entered the Military College of Turin.[1]\n In 1866 he enrolled at the Military Academy of Turin, and become a Lieutenant of Engineers. Enrico enrolled in the Scuola di Applicazione Artiglieria e Genio (Application School of Artillery and Engineers) in Turin in 1868.[1]\n Upon graduation in 1870, he was assigned to Casale Monferrato, where he was able to work in the police station's workshop. He began working on a systematic testing of propellers.[1] \nHe subsequently studied at Politecnico di Milano and graduated in Industrial Engineering.[2]\n In 1877, he developed an early helicopter powered by a steam engine. It was the first of\nits type that rose to a height of 13 meters, where it remained for some 20 seconds, after a vertical take-off from a park in Milan.[2]\n Then, he worked in Forl\u00ec, in a society named Societ\u00e0 Anonima Forlivese per l\u2019illuminazione a gas e per la fonderia di ferro.\n Later he designed and built a series of dirigibles, notably, designed in 1901 and launched in 1909, the Leonardo da Vinci that he dedicated to the famous Renaissance inventor and, in 1912, the Citt\u00e0 di Milano, dedicated to his beloved home town.[3] The latter showed exceptionally good characteristics of stability and controllability that won Forlanini international renown.[3] A further four airships were constructed: F3, F4, F5 and F6. A seventh, named Omnia Dir was only completed after his death.\n He is also known for his hydrofoils that he started modelling since 1898. One of those, built at full scale, used a ladder system of foils and a 60\u00a0hp (45\u00a0kW) engine driving two counter-rotating air props.\nDuring testing on Lake Maggiore in 1906, this craft reached a top speed of 68\u00a0km/h (42.5\u00a0mph). He also tested a hydrofoil with a 25 horsepower (19\u00a0kW) steam engine but this only achieved around 50 kilometres per hour (31\u00a0mph) in 1908-1909.[4]\n Forlanini obtained a number of British and American patents on his ideas and designs, most of which were aimed at seaplane applications.[5]\n He died in 1930 while still working on the design of the Omnia Dir airship.\n Milan has dedicated to him its city airport, also named Linate Airport, as well as the nearby park, the Parco Forlanini. He also has an avenue named after him.\n ", "tags": ["1848 births", "1930 deaths", "Physicians from Milan", "Italian inventors", "Italian aerospace engineers", "Airship designers", "Polytechnic University of Milan alumni", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles to be expanded from November 2018", "All articles to be expanded", "Articles needing translation from Italian Wikipedia", "Articles to be expanded from June 2008", "Articles using small message boxes", "Commons link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Italian engineer\nThis article may be expanded with text translated from the corresponding article in Italian.
