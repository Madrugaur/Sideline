{"name": "Erika Pannwitz", "content": "Erika Pannwitz (May 26, 1904 in Hohenlychen, Germany \u2013 November 25, 1975 in Berlin[1]) was a German mathematician who worked in the area of geometric topology. During World War II, Pannwitz worked as a cryptanalyst in the Department of Signal Intelligence Agency of the German Foreign Office (German: Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt) colloquially known as Pers Z S.[2] After the war, she became editor-in-chief of Zentralblatt MATH.\n Erika Pannwitz attended the Pannwitz Outdoor School[3] in Hohenlychen until 10th grade, and graduated from Augusta State School in Berlin in 1922.  She studied mathematics in Berlin, and also for a semester in Freiburg (1925) and G\u00f6ttingen (1928).  After passing her teaching exam in 1927 (in mathematics, physics, and chemistry), Pannwitz was promoted in 1931 to Dr Phil at Friedrich Wilhelms University with doctoral advisors Heinz Hopf and Erhard Schmidt.[4] Her thesis titled: Eine elementargeometrische Eigenschaft von Verschlingungen und Knoten (An elementary geometric property of entanglements and knots), which appeared two years later in the prestigious journal Mathematische Annalen, was honored opus eximium being considered an outstanding thesis. Both doctoral advisors wrote extraordinary statements about the thesis. Hopf in particular wrote eight pages of comments and left a summary quoted below:\n Schmidt also wrote an extraordinary statement on the thesis:\n In her thesis, she established that every piecewise linear knot in general position (other than the unknot) has a quadrisecant, i.e., four collinear points.  The topic was suggested to her by Otto Toeplitz.[6][7]\n In September 1930, Pannwitz became an editor of Jahrbuch \u00fcber die Fortschritte der Mathematik.  From 1940 to 1945, she worked in the cryptography service (with Helmut Grunsky) as part of the war effort.  After Germany's defeat in World War II, she briefly held an assistant position at Marburg University. In 1946, she returned to Berlin to work as an editor for Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Mathematik,[8] and after the death of its previous editor-in-chief, Hermann Ludwig Schmid\u00a0[de], in 1956, she became editor-in-chief.[9]  Travel to work was awkward, especially after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, because she lived in West Berlin and had to pass through checkpoints to reach the Zentralblatt offices in East Berlin.  East Germany at that time had mandatory retirement at age 60, which she reached in 1964.  From 1964 until her retirement in 1969 she worked at the Zentralblatt office in West Berlin.[8]\n Although Pannwitz had written what was considered an outstanding thesis, throughout her career, she never held a regular academic position. The reasons for this are unknown, but there could have been some element of discrimination, perhaps due to her gender or politics or both.[4][5]\n ", "tags": ["1904 births", "1975 deaths", "People from Lychen", "People from the Province of Brandenburg", "German women mathematicians", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Topologists", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Webarchive template archiveis links", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles containing German-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician and topologist\n An example of a quadrisecant of a knot (a trefoil)\nErika Pannwitz (May 26, 1904 in Hohenlychen, Germany \u2013 November 25, 1975 in Berlin[1]) was a German mathematician who worked in the area of geometric topology.

Both doctoral advisors wrote extraordinary statements about the thesis. Hopf in particular wrote eight pages of comments and left a summary quoted below:\n\nThe author has thus completely solved a difficult concrete problem that has been posed by completely independent investigations; It has achieved this goal by an expedient choice of new concepts, by understanding and profound insight into the difficult material presented to it, by the mastery of older methods and their new uses, and thus proving their scientific maturity in this first essay.\nSince, in my judgment, both the objective scientific value of this work and the subjective performance it achieves exceed the level of good dissertations, I ask the faculty to accept the dissertation submitted by Miss Pannwitz as \"eximium\".[5]\nSchmidt also wrote an extraordinary statement on the thesis:\n\nI agree with the vote of Mr. Hopf. The topology is one of the most promising yet at the same time most difficult areas of mathematics, because the methodological-technical apparatus is still so in the beginning, that every valuable result can be achieved only with a high mass of strong ingenuity. The present work has enriched the topology with a series of extraordinarily beautiful sentences[5]\nIn her thesis, she established that every piecewise linear knot in general position (other than the unknot) has a quadrisecant, i.e., four collinear points.
