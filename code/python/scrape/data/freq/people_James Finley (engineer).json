{"name": "James Finley (engineer)", "content": "James Finley (1756[1] \u2013 1828), aka Judge James Finley, is widely recognized as the first designer and builder of the modern suspension bridge. Born in Ireland,[1] Finley moved to a 287-acre (1.16\u00a0km2) farm in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, near Uniontown.[2] Elected a justice of the peace in 1784, he went on to become county commissioner in 1789, and a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and Senate. From 1791 until his death, he was an Associate Judge for Fayette County.[2]\n\nHis Jacob's Creek Bridge, built in 1801 for US$600,[3] and demolished in 1833, was the first example of a suspension bridge using wrought iron chains and with a level deck. It connected Uniontown to Greensburg, spanning 70 feet (21 metres), and was 12\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (3.81\u00a0m) wide.[3]\n\nFinley is also credited with designing and constructing a chain suspension bridge across Dunlap's Creek in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, in 1809. In 1820, however, the bridge collapsed under a heavy snow combined with the loads from a six-horse wagon team. The bridge was replaced by the Dunlap's Creek Bridge, the country's first cast-iron bridge, in 1835.[4]\n Other bridges built in accord with his patent include:\n Although he has been credited with designing as many as forty bridges, only twenty sites have been identified.
