He was also one of the inventors of the magnetotellurics method in geophysics. Other transliterations of his surname include \"Tychonoff\", \"Tychonov\", \"Tihonov\", \"Tichonov.\"\n Born in Gzhatsk, he studied at the Moscow State University where he received a Ph.D. in 1927 under the direction of Pavel Sergeevich Alexandrov.[1] In 1933 he was appointed as a professor at Moscow State University. He became a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences on 29 January 1939 and a full member of the USSR Academy of Sciences on 1 July 1966.\n Tikhonov worked in a number of different fields in mathematics. He made important contributions to topology, functional analysis, mathematical physics, and certain classes of ill-posed problems. Tikhonov regularization, one of the most widely used methods to solve ill-posed inverse problems, is named in his honor.  He is best known for his work on topology, including the metrization theorem he proved in 1926, and the Tychonoff's theorem, which states that every product of arbitrarily many compact topological spaces is again compact. In his honor, completely regular topological spaces are also named Tychonoff spaces.\n In mathematical physics, he proved the fundamental uniqueness theorems for the heat equation[2] and studied Volterra integral equations.\n He founded the theory of asymptotic analysis for differential equations with small parameter in the leading derivative.[3]\n Tikhonov played the leading role in founding the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics of Moscow State University and served as its first dean during the period of 1970\u20131990.\n Tikhonov received numerous honors and awards for his work, including the Lenin Prize (1966) and the Hero of Socialist Labor (1954, 1986).\n ", "tags": ["1906 births", "1993 deaths", "Soviet mathematicians", "Russian inventors", "20th-century Russian mathematicians", "Topologists", "Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Full Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences", "Moscow State University alumni", "Heroes of Socialist Labour", "Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin", "20th-century inventors", "Moscow State University faculty", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Andrey TikhonovBorn(1906-10-17)17 October 1906Gzhatsk, Russian EmpireDiedOctober 7, 1993(1993-10-07) (aged\u00a086)Moscow, RussiaNationalityRussianAlma\u00a0materMoscow State UniversityKnown\u00a0forImportant contributions to topology, functional analysis, mathematical physics, ill-posed problems; Tychonoff spaces, Tychonoff's theorem, Tikhonov regularization, Tikhonov's theorem (dynamical systems), magnetotellurics geophysical method.Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsMoscow State UniversityDoctoral advisorPavel AlexandrovDoctoral studentsAleksandr Andreyevich Samarski\u012d\n\nAndrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov (Russian: \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0301\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0422\u0438\u0301\u0445\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432; October 17, 1906 \u2013 October 7, 1993) was a Soviet and Russian mathematician and geophysicist known for important contributions to topology, functional analysis, mathematical physics, and ill-posed problems.
