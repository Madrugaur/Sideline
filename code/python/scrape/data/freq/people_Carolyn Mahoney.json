{"name": "Carolyn Mahoney", "content": "Carolyn Ray Boone Mahoney (born 1946) is an American mathematician who served as President of Lincoln University of Missouri.[1] Her research interests include combinatorics, graph theory, and matroids.[2]\n Carolyn Mahoney was born the sixth of thirteen children in 1946 in Memphis, Tennessee to Stephen and Myrtle Boone. Her grandmother cared for the children while her mother worked. Mahoney attended Catholic schools, where she was encouraged in her interest in mathematics by the nuns. As a teenager, Mahoney's parents separated due to her father's drinking and gambling and the family was forced to move to a lower-class neighborhood. \n Mahoney and her siblings were known for being smart in their neighborhood. She graduated from Father Bertrand High School in 1964.[2]\n Mahoney attended Mount St. Scholastica College, a Catholic, all-female college in Kansas for three years before finishing her degree in mathematics at Siena College in Memphis, Tennessee in 1970.[2] She then earned her master's degree in mathematics in 1972 and a doctorate in 1983, both from Ohio State University. Her doctorate involved matroid theory and enumerative combinatorics, and was supervised by Thomas Allan Dowling. She was  the 25th black woman to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics in the U.S.[3]\n After earning her doctorate, Mahoney taught first at Denison University from 1984 to 1989, and Ohio State for two years. She also served on the test development committee for the College Board from 1986 to 1989. In 1989, Mahoney was the first mathematician to be selected for the faculty at California State University San Marcos,[2] and was one of twelve founding faculty of the San Marcos campus.[1]\n In 1994 and 1995, Mahoney served as a program director at the National Science Foundation, and she later worked as an administrator at Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina.\nIn 2005, Mahoney was named president of Lincoln University of Missouri.[1] She retired in 2012.[4]\n Mahoney's research has focused largely on open problems in graph theory and combinatorics. As well as her thesis work on matroids, she has also published research on the Hadwiger\u2013Nelson problem concerning the chromatic number of unit distance graphs.[5]\n She believes that she has had a hard time finding collaborators due to the fact that she is a Black female in mathematics. She is also a proponent of educational reform, especially supporting cultural diversity in university faculty. She believes that through the efforts of organizations such as the Mathematical Association of America and the Association for Women in Mathematics the environment for women in mathematics has improved.[2]\n In 1989, Mahoney was inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame.[3]\n A scholarship at CSU San Marcos[6] and a walking trail at Lincoln University[7] have been named in her honor.\n Mahoney was also recognized by Mathematically Gifted & Black as a Black History Month 2018 Honoree.[8]\n # denotes interim president\n ", "tags": ["1946 births", "Living people", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "African-American mathematicians", "Ohio State University Graduate School alumni", "California State University faculty", "Elizabeth City State University faculty", "Presidents of Lincoln University (Missouri)", "Graph theorists", "Mathematicians from Tennessee", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "African-American academics", "Women heads of universities and colleges", "American academic administrators", "African-American educators", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nFor the American politician, see Carolyn Maloney.Carolyn Mahoney18th President of Lincoln University of MissouriIn office2005\u20132012\nPersonal detailsBorn1946Memphis, Tennessee, U.S.Alma materSiena College (B.S.)Ohio State University (M.S., Ph.D)\nCarolyn Ray Boone Mahoney (born 1946) is an American mathematician who served as President of Lincoln University of Missouri.[1] Her research interests include combinatorics, graph theory, and matroids.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Contributions\n4 Awards and honors\n5 References\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nCarolyn Mahoney was born the sixth of thirteen children in 1946 in Memphis, Tennessee to Stephen and Myrtle Boone.
