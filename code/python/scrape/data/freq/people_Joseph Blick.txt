{"name": "Joseph Blick", "content": "\n Joseph James Blick (September 20, 1867 \u2013 September 5, 1947), sometimes credited as Joseph J. Blick, was an American architect who worked on commercial and residential projects and is best known for diverse residences in Southern California ranging from Mission to Modern styles. Born and raised in Clinton, Iowa, his father James Shannon Blick was a building contractor. The Blick family moved to Pasadena, California in 1887 soon after his sister Blanche married Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout and long time resident of California. Blick began working in Pasadena as a contractor with his father and in 1889 he apprenticed with T. William Parkes, a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1891, he married Daisy Russell, a first cousin of Frederick Russell Burnham. After completing his apprenticeship, Blick and Lester S. Moore founded their own architecture firm, Blick & Moore, in Los Angeles in 1895, where he continued to work until his retirement in 1937.
