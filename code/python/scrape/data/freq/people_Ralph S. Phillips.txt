{"name": "Ralph S. Phillips", "content": "Ralph Saul Phillips (23 June 1913 \u2013 23 November 1998) was an American mathematician and academic known for his contributions to functional analysis, scattering theory, and servomechanisms. He served as a Professor of mathematics at Stanford University. He made major contributions to acoustical scattering theory in collaboration with Peter Lax, proving remarkable results on local energy decay and the connections between poles of the scattering matrix and the analytic properties of the resolvent. With Lax, he coauthored the widely referred book on scattering theory titled Scattering Theory for Automorphic Functions. Phillips received the 1997 Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement.[2]\n Phillips was born in Oakland on 23 June 1913. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1935 and his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1939 under the direction of Theophil H. Hildebrandt.\n From 1939 until 1942 he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, an instructor at the University of Washington, and an instructor at Harvard University. It was at the University of Washington he met his future wife, Jean.[3] During the war he led a research group at the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the facility where much of the theoretical and practical work on radar technology was done. This work led to his book Theory of Servomechanisms,[4] which for many years was the standard text in the subject. After the war he returned to mathematics, joining as an Assistant Professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. He moved to the University of Southern California the next year and returned to UCLA in 1958. In 1960 he joined Stanford University and remained there until his death in 1998. He was the Robert Grimmett Professor of Mathematics at Stanford. Philips's work (with A. Lubotzky and P. Sarnak) on Ramanujan graphs had a huge impact on combinatorics and computer science.\n ", "tags": ["1913 births", "1998 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "University of California, Los Angeles alumni", "University of Michigan alumni", "University of California, Los Angeles faculty", "Stanford University Department of Mathematics faculty", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from February 2020", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nRalph S.
