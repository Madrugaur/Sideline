She graduated from Hunter College in 1922 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics, after also taking some classes at Columbia University and New York University. She became an instructor at Hunter College while earning a master's degree and Ph.D. from Bryn Mawr College in 1924 and 1926 respectively.[1] Her dissertation, supervised by Anna Johnson Pell Wheeler, was An Integral Equation with an Associated Integral Condition.[2] She became a regular-rank faculty member at Hunter College in 1932 and retired from there as an associate professor in 1972.[1]\n She died on a round-the-world cruise, shortly after leaving Hong Kong, after being overcome with grief at the recent death of her brother.[1]\n Although not active in research mathematics after her doctorate, Guggenb\u00fchl represented Hunter College at many offerings of the International Congress of Mathematicians.
