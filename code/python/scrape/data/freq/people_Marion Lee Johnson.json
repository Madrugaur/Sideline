{"name": "Marion Lee Johnson", "content": "Marion Lee Johnson is an American mathematician who was crucial or very important to the landing of the Apollo 11 mission. She was a mathematician on the Boeing/NASA team, where she worked in preparing data for the vehicle impact trajectories.[1] Her perfect score over 20 successful missions earned her a place on the Apollo/Saturn V Roll of Honor.[2][1]\n After completion of the project, she worked for Pfizer for 26 years. She currently lives in New Jersey, where she works at the Branford Hall Career Institute as a Computer and Security Instructor.\n She was born in a working-class family in Savannah, Georgia, with three sisters and a brother.[3] She attended school at Moses Jackson, in a segregated neighborhood. Very early, she fell in love with mathematics, and credits this love to her 7th grade maths teacher, Walter B. Simmons.[4][5] She graduated class valedictorian from high school at Thompkins High School in 1963.[6][2] In 1967, she was granted a scholarship at Talladega College in Talladega, Alabama, to study mathematics,[7] and assumed that her degree would lead her to become a teacher.[4] After losing her scholarship because her grades had slipped, Johnson took out a loan to continue her degree, and prioritised her studies in order to requalify for the scholarship.[3]\n After graduation, at the age of 21, she went to work as an associate engineer at Boeing Company in Huntsville, Alabama.[8][2][9] She was assigned to the Launch Systems branch of the Boeing/NASA team at the Marshall Space Flight Centre to prepare the landing of the Apollo 11 mission.[1][2] At the time, very few women worked at the Space Flight Centre.[5] Johnson worked under the supervision of Arthur Rudolph and rocket designer Wernher von Braun, on the calculations to simulate vehicle piece impact trajectories (where the booster rockets would fall).[1][2][9] According to Lee, Boeing was a diverse place. In an interview for 1010 WINS' with Larry Mullins in 2018, she said: \"You had a lot of people there - a lot of people from all different cultures - and we all worked together.\"[8] According to Johnson, it was only after seeing the 2016 movie Hidden Figures that she realised how important her own contributions were to NASA.[10]\n After two years working for Boeing/NASA, Johnson then went to work at Pfizer, Inc., where she became Project Leader for the Corporate Information Technology Division.[2] She retired from Pfizer after 26 years.[2]\n A resident of Union County, New Jersey, she recently retired from Branford Hall Career Institute as a Computer Networking and Security Instructor.[6] The city of Plainfield awarded Johnson the key to the city, and designated two days to honor her legacy.[8][11] She is married to J.
