He added that some gay relationships are \"healthier\" than their straight counterparts.[54] He said in a BBC interview that he wished he had \"buttoned\" his lip before asking if its legalization would see fathers marry sons.[55][56]\n He supports the legal availability of abortion, having said that he believes that \"women should be allowed to make the decision\".

Irons's wife and children are Catholic; Irons has also been described as a practising Catholic[75] and has stated:\n I don't go to church much because I don't like belonging to a club, and I don't go to confession or anything like that, I don't believe in it. But I try to be aware of where I fail and I occasionally go to services. I would hate to be a person who didn't have a spiritual side because there's nothing to nourish you in life apart from retail therapy.[76] He owns Kilcoe Castle near Ballydehob, County Cork, Ireland, and had the castle painted a traditional ochre colour which was misreported as being 'pink'.[77] He also has another Irish residence in The Liberties of Dublin, as well as a home in his birth town of Cowes, a family house in Oxfordshire and a mews house in Notting Hill, London.[78]  Irons is fluent in French.[79]\n In March 2016 Irons told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that he would refuse an invitation to the palace to accept a New Year Honour should it ever arrive: \"I became an actor to be a rogue and a vagabond so I don't think it would be apt for the establishment to pull me in as one of their own, for I ain't.\"[80]\n ", "tags": ["1948 births", "Living people", "20th-century English male actors", "21st-century English male actors", "Alumni of Bristol Old Vic Theatre School", "Annie Award winners", "Audiobook narrators", "Best Actor Academy Award winners", "Best Actor Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners", "Best Drama Actor Golden Globe (film) winners", "Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe (television) winners", "British people of Irish descent", "British people of Scottish descent", "C\u00e9sar Honorary Award recipients", "Cusack family (Ireland)", "David di Donatello winners", "English male film actors", "English male Shakespearean actors", "English male stage actors", "English male television actors", "English male voice actors", "English people of Irish descent", "English people of Scottish descent", "English Roman Catholics", "FAO Goodwill ambassadors", "Irons family", "Labour Party (UK) people", "Male actors of Irish descent", "Male actors of Scottish descent", "Outstanding Narrator Primetime Emmy Award winners", "Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie Screen Actors Guild Award winners", "Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie Primetime Emmy Award winners", "People educated at Sherborne School", "People from Cowes", "Primetime Emmy Award winners", "Royal Shakespeare Company members", "Tony Award winners", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from July 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with dead external links from October 2018", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "EngvarB from May 2017", "Use dmy dates from January 2019", "Articles with hCards", "Articles needing additional references from October 2020", "All articles needing additional references", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Internet Broadway Database person ID same as Wikidata", "Articles with IBDb links", "Turner Classic Movies person ID same as Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "English actor\n\n\nJeremy IronsIrons at the 2015 San Diego Comic-ConBornJeremy John Irons (1948-09-19) 19 September 1948 (age\u00a072)Cowes, Isle of Wight, EnglandNationalityBritishAlma\u00a0materBristol Old Vic Theatre SchoolOccupationActor, activistYears\u00a0active1969\u2013presentSpouse(s)\n\nJulie Hallam\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01969; div.\u00a01969)\u200b\n\nSin\u00e9ad Cusack\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01978)\u200b\nChildren2, including Max IronsRelativesSorcha Cusack (sister-in-law)  Niamh Cusack (sister-in-law)  P\u00e1draig Cusack (brother-in-law)  Catherine Cusack (sister-in-law)  Cyril Cusack (father-in-law)  Maureen Cusack (mother-in-law)\nJeremy John Irons (born 19 September 1948)[1] is an English actor and activist.

In 2005, he appeared in the films Casanova opposite Heath Ledger, and Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven.

He read the audiobook recording of Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist, Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita (he had also appeared in the 1997 film version of the novel), and James and the Giant Peach by the children's author Roald Dahl.[26]\nIn particular, he was praised for recording the poetry of T. S. Eliot for BBC Radio 4. Beginning in 2012 with The Waste Land, he went on to record Four Quartets in 2014, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock on the centenary of its publication in 2015, and Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats in 2016. He finally completed recording the entire canon of T. S. Eliot which was broadcast over New Year's Day 2017.[27] In 2020, Irons was one of 40 British voices to read three to four verses (broadcast daily) of Samuel Taylor Coleridge\u2019s 150-verse 18th century poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.[28]\nOne of his best known film roles has turned out to be lending his distinctive voice to Scar in The Lion King (1994) serving as the main antagonist of the film. Irons has since provided voiceovers for three Disney World attractions. He narrated the Spaceship Earth ride, housed in the large geodesic globe at Epcot in Florida from October 1994 to July 2007.[29] He was also the English narrator for the Studio Tram Tour: Behind the Magic at the Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Paris.[30] He voiced H. G. Wells in the English-language version of the former Disney attraction The Timekeeper. He also reprised his role as Scar in Fantasmic. He is also one of the readers in the 4x CD boxed set of The Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde, produced by Marc Sinden and sold in aid of the Royal Theatrical Fund.[31]\nHe serves as the English-language version of the audio guide for Westminster Abbey in London.[32] Irons has served as voice-over in several big cat documentary films (at least two by National Geographic): Eye of the Leopard (2006),[33] The Last Lions (2011),[34] The Unlikely Leopard (2012),[35] and Jade Eyed Leopard (2020).[36]\nBetween 2009 and 2012 he narrated the French-produced documentary series about volcanoes, Life on Fire. The series premiered on PBS in the United States on 2 January 2013.\nIn 2008, two researchers, a linguist and a sound engineer, found \"the perfect [male] voice\" to be a combination of Irons's and Alan Rickman's voices based on a sample of 50 voices.[37] Coincidentally, the two actors played brothers in the Die Hard series of films. Speaking at 200 words per minute and pausing for 1.2 seconds between sentences, Irons came very close to the ideal voice model, with the linguist Andrew Linn  explaining why his \"deep gravelly tones\" inspired trust in listeners.[37] He recited the spoken sections, most notably \"Late Lament\", for The Moody Blues' 50th Anniversary Tour of \"Days Of Future Passed\", and also appears on the video presentation.[38]\n\nMusic[edit]\nIn 1985, Irons directed a music video for Carly Simon and her heavily promoted single, \"Tired of Being Blonde\", and in 1994, he had a cameo role in the video for Elastica's hit single \"Connection\".[39]\nIrons has contributed to other musical performances, recording William Walton's Fa\u00e7ade with Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Stravinsky's The Soldier's Tale conducted by the composer, and in 1987 the songs from Lerner and Loewe's My Fair Lady with Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, released on the Decca label. Irons sang segments of  \"Be Prepared\" in the film The Lion King.\nTo mark the 100th anniversary of No\u00ebl Coward's birth, Irons sang a selection of his songs at the 1999 Last Night of the Proms held at the Royal Albert Hall in London, ending with \"London Pride\", a patriotic song written in the spring of 1941 during the Blitz.[40] In 2003, Irons played Fredrik Egerman in a New York revival of Stephen Sondheim's A Little Night Music, and two years later appeared as King Arthur in Lerner and Loewe's Camelot at the Hollywood Bowl. He performed the Bob Dylan song \"Make You Feel My Love\" on the 2006 charity album Unexpected Dreams \u2013 Songs From the Stars.[41]\nIn 2009, Irons appeared on the Touchstone album Wintercoast, recording a narrative introduction to the album.[42] Recording took place in New York City, New York in February 2009 during rehearsals for his Broadway play Impressionism.\n\nPolitical views and activism[edit]\nAt the 1991 Tony Awards, Irons was one of the few celebrities to wear the red ribbon to support the fight against AIDS. He was the first celebrity to wear it onscreen.[43][44]\nIn 1998, Irons and his wife were named in the list of the biggest private financial donors to the Labour Party, a year after its return to government with Tony Blair's victory in the 1997 United Kingdom general election, after 18 years in opposition.[45] He was also one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas at the 2015 UK general election.[46]\nIn 2004, he publicly declared his support for the Countryside Alliance, referring to the 2004 Hunting Act as an \"outrageous assault on civil liberties\" and \"one of the two most devastating parliamentary votes in the last century\".[47]\nIrons is an outspoken critic of the death penalty and has supported the campaign by the human rights organisation Amnesty International UK to abolish capital punishment worldwide.[48] Among his arguments, Irons states the death penalty infringes on two fundamental human rights, the right to life, and no-one shall be subject to torture, adding that while the person accused of a crime may have abused those rights, to advocate the same be done to them is to join them.[48]\nDuring a 2007 Q&A with The Guardian, Irons named Tony Blair as the living person he most admired; reasoning \"For living so publicly with the knowledge that he's not perfect.\" He then named George W. Bush as the living person he most despised, stating \u201cto hold his position he should have surrounded himself with more reliable people.\u201d[49]\nIn 2009, Irons signed a petition in support of Polish film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after he was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.[50]\nHe has been criticised in the British Medical Journal for his fundraising activities in support of The College of Medicine, an alternative medicine lobby group in the UK linked to Prince Charles.[51]\nIn 2013, he caused controversy for an interview with the HuffPost, in which he said he \"doesn't have a strong feeling either way\" on gay marriage but expressed fears that it could \"debase\" marital law, suggesting it could be manipulated to allow fathers to avoid paying tax when passing on their estates to their sons, because he supposed incest laws would not apply to men.[52][53] He later clarified his comments, saying he was providing an example of a situation that could cause a \"legal quagmire\" under the laws that allow same-sex marriage, and that he had been misinterpreted. He added that some gay relationships are \"healthier\" than their straight counterparts.[54] He said in a BBC interview that he wished he had \"buttoned\" his lip before asking if its legalization would see fathers marry sons.[55][56]\nHe supports the legal availability of abortion, having said that he believes that \"women should be allowed to make the decision\". Nevertheless, he agreed with a pro-life advocate and was quoted as saying that \"the church is right to say it's a sin\".[57]\n\nCharity work[edit]\nHe is the Patron of the \"Emergency Response Team Search and Rescue\" or \"ERTSAR\" which is a life saving United Nations recognised disaster response search and rescue team and registered Charity. It is based in his home County of Oxfordshire, England.  He supports a number of other charities, including the Prison Phoenix Trust in England, and the London-based Evidence for Development which seeks to improve the lives of the world's most needy people by preventing famines and delivering food aid, for both of which he is an active patron.[58][59][60] In 2000, Irons received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Olivia de Havilland during the International Achievement Summit in London.[61][62]\nIn 2010, Irons starred in a promotional video,[63] for \"The 1billionhungry project\" \u2013 a worldwide drive to attract at least one million signatures to a petition calling on international leaders to move hunger to the top of the political agenda.[64]\nIrons was named Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2011.[65] He provided the narration of the 2013 documentary (by Andrew Lauer[66]) Sahaya Going Beyond about the work of the charity Sahaya International.[67]\nIn November 2015, Irons supported the No Cold Homes campaign by the UK charity Turn2us.[68] Irons was one of nearly thirty celebrities, who included Helen Mirren, Hugh Laurie and Ed Sheeran, to donate items of winter clothing to the campaign, with the proceeds used to help people in the UK struggling to keep their homes warm in winter.[68]\nIrons is a patron of the Chiltern Shakespeare Company, which produces Shakespearean plays annually in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire,[69] and a London-based drama school, The Associated Studios.[70] Irons was bestowed an Honorary Life Membership by the University College Dublin Law Society in September 2008, in honour of his contribution to television, film, audio, music, and theatre.[71][72] Also in 2008, Irons was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Southampton Solent University.[73] On 20 July 2016, Irons was announced as the first Chancellor of Bath Spa University.[74]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n Kilcoe Castle, built c.\u00a01450 by the Clan Dermod MacCarthy\nIrons married Julie Hallam in 1969, but they divorced later that year.[1] He married Irish actress Sin\u00e9ad Cusack on 28 March 1978.[1] They have two sons, Samuel \"Sam\" Irons (born 1978), who works as a photographer, and who co-starred with his father in Danny, the Champion of the World (film), and Maximilian \"Max\" Irons (born 1985), also an actor. Both of Irons's sons have appeared in films with their father. Irons's wife and children are Catholic; Irons has also been described as a practising Catholic[75] and has stated:\n\nI don't go to church much because I don't like belonging to a club, and I don't go to confession or anything like that, I don't believe in it. But I try to be aware of where I fail and I occasionally go to services. I would hate to be a person who didn't have a spiritual side because there's nothing to nourish you in life apart from retail therapy.[76]\nHe owns Kilcoe Castle near Ballydehob, County Cork, Ireland, and had the castle painted a traditional ochre colour which was misreported as being 'pink'.[77] He also has another Irish residence in The Liberties of Dublin, as well as a home in his birth town of Cowes, a family house in Oxfordshire and a mews house in Notting Hill, London.[78]  Irons is fluent in French.[79]\nIn March 2016 Irons told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that he would refuse an invitation to the palace to accept a New Year Honour should it ever arrive: \"I became an actor to be a rogue and a vagabond so I don't think it would be apt for the establishment to pull me in as one of their own, for I ain't.\"[80]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nMain article: Jeremy Irons on stage and screen\nAwards and Nominations[edit]\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.
