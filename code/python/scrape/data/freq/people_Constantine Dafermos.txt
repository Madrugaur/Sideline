He received a Diploma in Civil\nEngineering from the National Technical University of Athens (1964) and a Ph.D. in Mechanics from Johns Hopkins University under the direction of Jerald Ericksen (1967). He has been an Assistant Professor at Cornell University (1968-1971) and an Associate Professor (1971-1975) and Professor (1975-) in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University. Since 1984, he has been the Alumni-Alumnae University Professor at Brown.[1]\n In recent years, his research has focused on nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws whose solutions spontaneously develop singularities propagating as shock waves. In particular, he is studying the interplay between thermodynamics and analysis in the theory of these systems and he is analyzing the fundamental role of entropy as a stabilizing agent.\n In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[2] \nIn 2016 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[3]\n ", "tags": ["Greek mathematicians", "National Technical University of Athens alumni", "Brown University faculty", "Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Living people", "1941 births", "Scientists from Athens", "Johns Hopkins University alumni", "Cornell University faculty", "Greek emigrants to the United States", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Not to be confused with Mihalis Dafermos.\n Dafermos (center) at Oberwolfach in 2004.
