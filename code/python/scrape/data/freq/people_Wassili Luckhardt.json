{"name": "Wassili Luckhardt", "content": "Wassili Luckhardt (22 July 1889 in Berlin\u00a0\u2013 2 December 1972 in Berlin) was a German architect. He studied at the Technical University of Berlin (Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin) and Dresden. Luckhardt and his brother Hans worked closely together for most of their lives. Both were members of the November Group (Novembergruppe), the Arbeitsrat f\u00fcr Kunst, the Glass Chain and, from 1926, the progressive architecture group Der Ring. The brothers shared an office with the architect Alfons Anker (b. 1872, d. 1952).\n From  1907 to 1914 he studied at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin-Charlottenburg and Dresden, with his studies interrupted by World War I.\nFrom 1921 to 1954 establishes architecture practice with his brother Hans, they shared offices with Alfons Anker from 1924 to 1934.\nHe was a  Member of the DDR Academy of Arts, Berlin, from 1955 until 1959 as a deputy director of the department of architecture.\nIn 1958 he was awarded the Art prize of the city of Berlin.\nHe received an honorary doctorate of the Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin in 1962.\n In the 1920s the brothers belonged to the 20th centuries rising architects.

It quickly became apparent however that the new regime required a different architectural language. They were professionally disqualified and could only build three single-family houses in this time, the exterior of which was made to blend in with the preferred style of the regime.\n After World War II they tried to return to their pre-war work. After the death of his brother Hans, Wassili ran the office alone.
