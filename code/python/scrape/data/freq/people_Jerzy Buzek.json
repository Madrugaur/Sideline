{"name": "Jerzy Buzek", "content": "\n Jerzy Karol Buzek [\u02c8j\u025b\u0290\u0268\u00a0\u02c8buz\u025bk] (listen) (born 3 July 1940) is a Polish politician and Member of the European Parliament from Poland. He has served as Prime Minister of Poland from 1997 to 2001, since being elected to the European Parliament in 2004, he has served as President of the European Parliament between 2009 and 2012.[1] He is married to Ludgarda Buzek[2] and is the father of Polish actress Agata Buzek.\n Jerzy Karol Buzek was born to a Lutheran family on 3 July 1940 in Smilovice, Czechoslovakia (under the National Socialist German occupation).[3] He was born into the prominent Buzek family, which participated in Polish politics in the Second Polish Republic during the interbellum. The family was part of the Polish community in Zaolzie.[4] Buzek's father was an engineer. After the Second World War, his family moved to Chorz\u00f3w. He is a Lutheran.\n In 1963 Jerzy Buzek graduated from the Mechanics-and-Energy Division of the Silesian University of Technology, specialising in chemical engineering. He became a scientist in the Chemical Engineering Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Since 1997 he has been a professor of technical science. He is also an honorary doctor of the universities in Seoul and Dortmund among others.[5]\n From 1997 to 2001, Buzek was a coalition Prime Minister of Poland.\n In 1998 he became the first laureate of the Grzegorz Palka Award[6] and was nominated European of the Year by the European Union Business Chambers Forum.\n In 1998 he was named 'Person of the Year' by the influential Polish political weekly Wprost. He won the award for the second time in 2009. On receiving the award again, as President of the European Parliament, he stressed that he was the first winner to be honoured for his work beyond the borders of Poland.[7]\n He was the first Prime Minister of the 3rd Republic of Poland to serve a full term.\n After losing the parliamentary elections in 2001, he stepped back from political life and focused more on his scientific work, becoming the prorector of Akademia Polonijna in Cz\u0119stochowa and professor in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of the Opole University of Technology in Opole.\n His return to political life in 2004 saw him gain the largest popular vote in Poland as the member for Katowice to the European Parliament standing for the Civic Platform.\n Whilst President of the European Parliament, on 30 March 2011, he was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Institution of Chemical Engineers at a meeting of the European Federation of Chemical Engineering (EFCE) in Brussels, Belgium.[8]\n In the 1980s, Buzek was an activist of the anti-communist movements, including the legal (1980\u20131981 and since 1989) and underground (1981\u20131989) Solidarity trade union and political movement in communist Poland. He was an active organiser of the trade union's regional and national underground authorities. He was also the chairman of the four national general meetings (1st, 4th, 5th, and 6th) when the Solidarity movement was allowed to participate in the political process again.[9]\n Jerzy Buzek was a member of the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) and co-author of the AWS's economic program. After the 1997 elections he was elected to the Sejm, the lower house of the Polish Parliament, and was soon appointed Prime Minister of Poland. In 1999 he became the chairman of the AWS Social Movement (Ruch Spo\u0142eczny AWS) and in 2001 he became the Chairman of the Solidarity Electoral Action coalition.[10]\n Between the years 1997\u20132001 he was the Prime Minister of Poland, first of the right-centrist AWS\u2013Freedom Union coalition government until 2001, and then of the rightist AWS minority government. His cabinet's major achievements were four significant political and economic reforms: a new local government and administration division of Poland, reform of the pension system, reform of the educational system, and reform of the medical care system.[11] AWS was defeated in the 2001 Polish parliamentary election. Buzek resigned as the chairman of AWS Social Movement and was replaced by Mieczys\u0142aw Janowski.\n On 13 June 2004, in the European Parliament election, 2004, Jerzy Buzek was elected a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from the Silesian Voivodeship, basing his candidacy only on the popularity of his name and on direct contact with the voters. He received a record number of votes, 173,389 (22.14% of the total votes in the region). His current party affiliation is with the Civic Platform, which is a member of the European People's Party.\n In the 2004\u20132009 European Parliament, he was a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, an alternate member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, a member of the Delegation to the EU\u2013Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, and an alternate delegate for the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America. He served as rapporteur on the EU's 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development, a multibillion-euro spending program for the years 2007\u20132013.\n On 7 June 2009, in the European Parliament election, 2009, Buzek was re-elected as a Member of the European Parliament from the Silesian Voivodeship constituency. Just as in the previous election, Buzek received a record number of votes in Poland: 393,117 (over 42% of the total votes in the district). On 12 September 2018, he voted in favor of approving the controversial Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market.[12]\n On 14 July 2009, Buzek was elected President of the European Parliament with 555 votes of the 644 votes cast, the largest majority ever,[13] becoming the first person from the former Eastern Bloc and the first former Prime Minister since Pierre Pflimlin to gain that position.[1] He succeeded the German Christian Democrat MEP, Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering.[1] He pledged to make human rights and the promotion of the Eastern partnership two of his priorities during his term of office, which will last two and a half years until, due to a political deal, Social Democrat MEP Martin Schulz will take over.[1][failed verification][14]\n In his inaugural address in Strasbourg, Buzek stated that among the greatest challenges faced by the European parliament were the economic crisis, European solidarity, human rights, and reform within the Parliament itself.[15] Buzek also stated he would be committed to reform of the European economy, tackling rising unemployment, energy security, and climate change, strengthening European solidarity and integration and promoting equal opportunities for women. However, Buzek noted that the Lisbon Treaty would be a prerequisite to any change \"(so that the Union can be) well-organised and effective\".[16]\n On 8 December 2009 Buzek was awarded by the Ministerpr\u00e4sident of North Rhine-Westphalia, Dr. J\u00fcrgen R\u00fcttgers, the annual \"Staatspreis award\". The prize was awarded in honor of his lifetime achievements and highlighted the European Parliament as a \"motor of integration.\" Affirming his commitment to the Eastern Partnership and \"those who do not have the possibility to participate in our European integration project\", Buzek announced that the prize money would be donated to the European Humanities University (EHU), A Belarusian university in exile in Vilnius.[17]\n The Lisbon Treaty, which came into force on 1 December 2009 shortly after Buzek assumed office, brought a conclusion to nearly a decade of internal discussions and greatly boosted the democratic powers of the European Parliament. From very early on Buzek has been a vocal supporter of the treaty as part of a wider push for greater political integration in Europe.[18] The rise in legislative powers under the treaty in fact represents almost a doubling in power.[19] Since its introduction Parliament has equal rights with the Council of Ministers over 40 new fields within the \"co-decision\" procedure, such as agriculture, energy security, immigration, justice and home affairs, health and structural funds.[19]\n In late 2011 Buzek's presidency also endorsed the 'Sixpack' legislation on economic governance to tackle the growing Eurozone crisis. This was a follow-up on the earlier Stability and Growth Pact and the Euro Plus Pact intended as a means of optimising macroeconomic surveillance in Europe and avoiding crises in the eurozone in the future.[20] Welcoming the parliament's adoption of the legislation on 28 October 2011, Buzek stated: \"The adoption of the six-pack by the whole European Parliament is good news for the European Union. We have a new economic rule-book. We have developed a powerful and resistant armour against any future crises. With the adoption of the six-pack, the EU significantly strengthens its budget discipline and moves towards true economic governance. We can not turn the clock back, but the package will ensure that Member States budgets will be credible.\"[21]\n One of Buzek's major challenges as EP president was dealing with the allegations of corruption, illegal lobbying and mismanagement of public funds of which several members of the European Parliament have been accused in the wake of a cash-for-amendments scandal. On 7 July 2011, the Conference of Presidents approved the first-ever code of conduct for MEPs and it was officially endorsed by the parliament on 1 December 2011.[22] The code sets out rules and principles that MEPs should follow in their dealings with outside parties in order to avoid conflicts of interest. \"Increased powers of the European Parliament must be accompanied by an increased transparency and accountability on behalf of its members\" Buzek has said of the code.[23] According to the code, MEPs have to provide clear declarations of their paid activities outside parliament, as well as the salary they receive. They also have to declare all other activities which might constitute a conflict of interest. The code contains an explicit ban on MEPs receiving payments or other rewards in exchange for influencing parliamentary decisions. It also sets out clear rules on the acceptance of gifts and on the issue of former MEPs working as lobbyists.[24]\n Jerzy Buzek with President of the European Commission Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso and Polish President Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski\n Jerzy Buzek and Jose Manuel Barroso during an EPP Summit in 2009\n European Big Three; Jerzy Buzek, Herman Van Rompuy, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\n Jerzy Buzek with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev\n Jerzy Buzek with President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili\n Jerzy Buzek with Polish journalist Pawe\u0142 Rogali\u0144ski\n Jerzy Buzek with Jyrki Katainen\n Jerzy Buzek with Mariano Rajoy\n Jerzy Buzek with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte\n He is a supporter of Ruch Chorz\u00f3w.[26]\n \n ", "tags": ["1940 births", "Academics of the University of Cambridge", "Civic Platform MEPs", "Grand Crosses with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "International Republican Institute", "Knights Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic", "Living people", "Members of the Polish Sejm 1997\u20132001", "MEPs for Poland 2004\u20132009", "MEPs for Poland 2009\u20132014", "MEPs for Poland 2014\u20132019", "MEPs for Poland 2019\u20132024", "People from Fr\u00fddek-M\u00edstek District", "People from Cieszyn Silesia", "Polish chemical engineers", "Polish dissidents", "Polish Lutherans", "Polish people from Zaolzie", "Presidents of the European Parliament", "Prime Ministers of Poland", "Recipients of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana, 1st Class", "Solidarity (Polish trade union) activists", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from August 2018", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1 errors: missing name", "Articles with dead external links from December 2017", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Use British English from August 2010", "Use dmy dates from March 2013", "Articles with hAudio microformats", "All articles with failed verification", "Articles with failed verification from November 2011", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nHis ExcellencyJerzy BuzekMEP24th President of the European ParliamentIn office14 July 2009\u00a0\u2013 17 January 2012Vice PresidentGiovanni PittellaRodi Kratsa-TsagaropoulouStavros LambrinidisMiguel Angel Mart\u00ednez Mart\u00ednezAlejo Vidal-QuadrasDagmar Roth-BehrendtLibor Rou\u010dekIsabelle DurantRoberta AngelilliDiana WallisP\u00e1l SchmittEdward McMillan-ScottRainer WielandSilvana Koch-MehrinPreceded byHans-Gert P\u00f6tteringSucceeded byMartin Schulz9th Prime Minister of PolandIn office31 October 1997\u00a0\u2013 19 October 2001PresidentAleksander Kwa\u015bniewskiDeputyLongin Komo\u0142owskiLeszek BalcerowiczJanusz TomaszewskiJanusz SteinhoffPreceded byW\u0142odzimierz CimoszewiczSucceeded byLeszek MillerMember of the European Parliamentfor PolandIncumbentAssumed office 20 July 2004Member of the Sejmfor Warsaw IIn office21 September 1991\u00a0\u2013 13 August 2004\nPersonal detailsBornJerzy Karol Buzek (1940-07-03) 3 July 1940 (age\u00a080) Smilowitz, Germany (now Czech Republic)Political partyCivic PlatformOther politicalaffiliationsEuropean People's PartySpouse(s)Ludgarda BuzekChildrenAgataEducationSilesian University of TechnologyAwards   Signature\nJerzy Karol Buzek [\u02c8j\u025b\u0290\u0268\u00a0\u02c8buz\u025bk] (listen) (born 3 July 1940) is a Polish politician and Member of the European Parliament from Poland.
