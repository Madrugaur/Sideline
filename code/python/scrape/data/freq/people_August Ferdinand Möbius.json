He then enrolled at the University of Leipzig, where he studied astronomy under the mathematician and astronomer Karl Mollweide.[3] In 1813, he began to study astronomy under the mathematically inclined professor Carl Friedrich Gauss at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, while Gauss was the director of the G\u00f6ttingen Observatory.  From there, he went to study with Carl Gauss's instructor, Johann Pfaff, at the University of Halle, where he completed his doctoral thesis The occultation of fixed stars in 1815.[3] In 1816, he was appointed  as Extraordinary Professor to the \"chair of astronomy and higher mechanics\" at the University of Leipzig.[3] M\u00f6bius died in Leipzig in 1868 at the age of 77. His son Theodor was a noted philologist.\n He is best known for his discovery of the M\u00f6bius strip, a non-orientable two-dimensional surface with only one side when embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space. It was independently discovered by Johann Benedict Listing a few months earlier.[3] The M\u00f6bius configuration, formed by two mutually inscribed tetrahedra, is also named after him. M\u00f6bius was the first to introduce homogeneous coordinates into projective geometry. He is recognized for the introduction of the Barycentric coordinate system.[4]\n Many mathematical concepts are named after him, including the M\u00f6bius plane, the M\u00f6bius transformations, important in projective geometry, and the M\u00f6bius transform of number theory.  His interest in number theory led to the important M\u00f6bius function \u03bc(n) and the M\u00f6bius inversion formula. In Euclidean geometry, he systematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of simplifying and unifying results.[5]\n ", "tags": ["1790 births", "1868 deaths", "People from Naumburg (Saale)", "German astronomers", "19th-century astronomers", "19th-century German mathematicians", "Number theorists", "Geometers", "Leipzig University alumni", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "University of Halle alumni", "Leipzig University faculty", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "August M\u00f6biusAugust Ferdinand M\u00f6bius (1790\u20131868)BornAugust Ferdinand M\u00f6bius(1790-11-17)17 November 1790Schulpforta, Electorate of SaxonyDied26 September 1868(1868-09-26) (aged\u00a077)Leipzig, German ConfederationNationalitySaxonAlma\u00a0materUniversity of LeipzigUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenUniversity of HalleKnown\u00a0forM\u00f6bius stripM\u00f6bius transformationsM\u00f6bius transformM\u00f6bius functionM\u00f6bius inversion formulaM\u00f6bius\u2013Kantor configurationM\u00f6bius\u2013Kantor graphScientific careerFieldsMathematicianInstitutionsUniversity of LeipzigDoctoral advisorJohann PfaffOther\u00a0academic advisorsCarl Friedrich GaussKarl MollweideDoctoral studentsOtto Wilhelm FiedlerOther\u00a0notable studentsHermann Hankel\n\nAugust Ferdinand M\u00f6bius (UK: /\u02c8m\u025c\u02d0bi\u0259s/, US: /\u02c8me\u026a-, \u02c8mo\u028a-/;[1] German: [\u02c8m\u00f8\u02d0bi\u032f\u028as]; 17\u00a0November 1790 \u2013 26\u00a0September 1868) was a German mathematician and theoretical astronomer.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Contributions\n3 Collected works\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nM\u00f6bius was born in Schulpforta, Saxony-Anhalt, and was descended on his mother's side from religious reformer Martin Luther.[2] He was home-schooled until he was 13, when he attended the College in Schulpforta in 1803, and studied there, graduating in 1809.
