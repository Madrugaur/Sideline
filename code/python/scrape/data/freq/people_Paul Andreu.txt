{"name": "Paul Andreu", "content": "Paul Andreu (10 July 1938 \u2013 11 October 2018) was a French architect, known for his designs of multiple airports such as Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, and multiple prestigious projects in China, including the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing.[1]\n Andreu was born at Caud\u00e9ran (Gironde), in southwest France. He graduated in 1958 from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique and continued his studies at the \u00c9cole des ponts ParisTech, graduating in 1961. He next studied under architect Paul Lamarche in the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, graduating in 1968. [2][3]\n Andreu was responsible for the design of numerous airports, including Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Manila), Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (Jakarta), Shanghai Pudong International Airport in China, Abu Dhabi International Airport, Dubai International Airport, Cairo International Airport, Brunei International Airport, and the Charles de Gaulle Airport, and Orly Airport in Paris. \n He was in charge of planning and constructing Charles de Gaulle Airport (Roissy) in Paris from 1967 on. On 23 May 2004 a portion of Terminal 2E  collapsed, killing four people. Terminal 2E, inaugurated in 2003, is the seventh terminal at Roissy by Andreu, and has been described as one of Andreu's boldest designs.[4] The collapse was attributed by the ad hoc administrative enquiry commission to a variety of technical causes and the lack of margins of safety in the design. Andreu blamed the collapse on poor execution by the building companies.[citation needed]\n Andreu's other projects included the Grande Arche at La D\u00e9fense in Paris (as associate of Johann Otto von Spreckelsen) and the National Grand Theater of China enclosed in a titanium and glass shell near Beijing's Tiananmen Square which was inaugurated on 22 December 2007.[5]\n In 2008, Andreu was hired to design a cultural centre and ticket office in Montreal's new Quartier des Spectacles entertainment district.[6]\n In 2011, Andreu became dean emeritus and chair professor of the Architecture Department at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, where he taught three months per year.[7] In 2015 and 2016, he was a member of the Prix Versailles judges panel.[8]\n ", "tags": ["1938 births", "2018 deaths", "People from Gironde", "Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand alumni", "20th-century French architects", "21st-century French architects", "French civil engineers", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni", "\u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech alumni", "Corps des ponts", "Commandeurs of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres", "Grand Officers of the National Order of Merit (France)", "Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Members of the Acad\u00e9mie des beaux-arts", "Zhejiang University faculty", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from October 2014", "Articles with French-language sources (fr)", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with suppressed authority control identifiers"], "raw": "French architect\nPaul AndreuBorn(1938-07-10)10 July 1938Bordeaux, FranceDied11 October 2018(2018-10-11) (aged\u00a080)Paris, FranceNationalityFrenchEducationLyc\u00e9e Louis-le-GrandAlma\u00a0mater\u00c9cole Polytechnique\u00c9cole des ponts ParisTechOccupationArchitectCivil engineer\n National Grand Theatre, Beijing\nPaul Andreu (10 July 1938 \u2013 11 October 2018) was a French architect, known for his designs of multiple airports such as Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, and multiple prestigious projects in China, including the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Projects\n3 Other activities\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nAndreu was born at Caud\u00e9ran (Gironde), in southwest France.
