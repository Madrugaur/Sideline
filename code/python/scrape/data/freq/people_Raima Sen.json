{"name": "Raima Sen", "content": "\n Raima Sen (born Raima Dev Varma on 7 November 1979)[1] is an Indian actress who is known for her work in Bengali and Hindi Film industry.\n Raima Sen was born on 7 November 1979 in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) to Moon Moon Sen and Bharat Dev Barma and the granddaughter of actress Suchitra Sen who is regarded as the \"Mahanayika\" of Bengali Cinema. Her sister Riya Sen is also in the Bollywood industry.[1] Their father Bharat Dev Varma is a member of the royal family of Tripura.[citation needed] Her paternal grandmother, Ila Devi, was the princess of Cooch Behar, whose younger sister Gayatri Devi was the Maharani of Jaipur.[citation needed] Her paternal great-grandmother Indira was the only daughter of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda.[2][3]\n Raima's maternal great-grandfather Adinath Sen was a prominent Kolkata businessman, whose son Dinanath Sen \u2013 a relative of former Union Law Minister Ashoke Kumar Sen- was the Diwan or a Minister of the Maharaja of Tripura.[4] The sisters are credited on-screen under their mother's maiden name, although their official papers carry the surname Dev Varma.[5]\n Sen made her debut in the film Godmother, which was a critically acclaimed[by whom?] success, but her minor role may have been overlooked in favour of the protagonist, played by Shabana Azmi. She then starred in the film Daman playing Raveena Tandon's daughter, where her small performance was appreciated.\n Her breakthrough role came when she starred in the Rituparno Ghosh's film Chokher Bali. After a few more average movies she had a critically acclaimed[by whom?] hit in 2005 with Parineeta, where she played the playmate of the film's heroine, played by the debutante Vidya Balan.
