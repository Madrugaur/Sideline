In 1904, he was appointed Professor of Physics at the University of Marseille, where he spent 16 years.\n In optics, he discovered an explanation for the phenomenon of interference fringes. Together with his colleague Alfred P\u00e9rot he invented the Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer in 1899.[5][6][7] He and Henri Buisson discovered the ozone layer in 1913.\n In 1921, Fabry was appointed Professor of General Physics at the Sorbonne and the\nfirst director of the new Institute of Optics.  In 1926 he also became professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He was the first general director of the Institut d'optique th\u00e9orique et appliqu\u00e9e and director of \"grande \u00e9cole\" \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure d'optique (SupOptique). In 1929, he received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 astronomique de France, the French astronomical society.\n Fabry was the President of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 astronomique de France from 1931-1933.[8]\n During his career Fabry published 197 scientific papers, 14 books, and over 100 popular articles. For his important scientific achievements he received the Rumford Medal from the Royal Society of London in 1918. In the United States his work was recognized by the Henry Draper Medal from the National Academy of Sciences (1919)[9] and the Franklin Medal from the Franklin Institute (1921).
