{"name": "William Stanier", "content": "\n Sir William Arthur Stanier, FRS[1]  (27 May 1876 \u2013 27 September 1965) was a British railway engineer, and was Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.[2]\n Sir William Stanier  was born in Swindon, where his father worked for the Great Western Railway (GWR) as William Dean's Chief Clerk, and educated at Swindon High School and also, for a single year, at Wycliffe College.\n In 1891 he followed his father into a career with the GWR, initially as an office boy and then for five years as an apprentice in the workshops. Between 1897 and 1900 he worked in the Drawing Office as a draughtsman, before becoming Inspector of Materials in 1900. In 1904, George Jackson Churchward appointed him as Assistant to the Divisional Locomotive Superintendent in London. In 1912 he returned to Swindon to become the Assistant Works Manager and in 1920 was promoted to the post of Works Manager.\n In late 1931, he was \"headhunted\" by Sir Josiah Stamp, chairman of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) to become the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of that railway from 1 January 1932. He was charged with introducing modern and more powerful locomotive designs, using his knowledge gained at Swindon with the GWR.[3] Stanier built many successful designs for the LMS, particularly the \"Black 5\" mixed traffic 4-6-0 and the 8F 2-8-0 freight locomotive. His Princess Coronation Class 4-6-2 No.6220 Coronation set a new British record of 114\u00a0mph, beating the previous record set by a Gresley A4.\n During WWII he worked as a consultant for the Ministry of Supply and retired in 1944. He was knighted on 9 February 1943 and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society[1][4] on his retirement, only the third locomotive engineer after Edward Bury and Robert Stephenson to receive that honour.  He was also president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers for 1944.\n He died in Rickmansworth in 1965. He had married in 1906 Ella Elizabeth, daughter of Levi L Morse;[5] they had one son and one daughter.[6]\n Sir William was a vice president of the Stephenson Locomotive Society for a number of years until his death in 1965.\n William Stanier, with the backing of Sir Josiah Stamp, Chairman of the company, reversed the small engine policy, which the LMS had inherited from the Midland Railway, with beneficial results.  Designs introduced by Stanier include:\n Stanier's designs were a strong influence on the later British Railways standard classes of steam locomotive designed by R A Riddles, which adopted LMS design principles above those of the other \"Big Four\".\n There is a secondary school in Crewe called Sir William Stanier Community School.\n ", "tags": ["1876 births", "1965 deaths", "People from Swindon", "People educated at Wycliffe College, Gloucestershire", "Locomotive builders and designers", "English railway mechanical engineers", "Fellows of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers", "Great Western Railway people", "London, Midland and Scottish Railway people", "Knights Bachelor", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "Use dmy dates from January 2017", "Use British English from January 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nSir William A.
