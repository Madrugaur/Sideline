{"name": "Gottfried K\u00f6the", "content": "Gottfried Maria Hugo K\u00f6the (born 25 December 1905 in Graz; died 30 April 1989 in Frankfurt) was an Austrian mathematician working in abstract algebra and functional analysis.\n In 1923 K\u00f6the enrolled in the University of Graz. He started studying chemistry, but switched to mathematics a year later after meeting the philosopher Alfred Kastil. In 1927 he submitted his thesis Beitr\u00e4ge zu Finslers Grundlegung der Mengenlehre (\"Contributions to Finsler's foundations of set theory\") and was awarded a doctorate. After spending a year in Z\u00fcrich working with Paul Finsler, K\u00f6the received a fellowship to visit the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he attended the lectures of Emmy Noether and  Bartel van der Waerden on the emerging subject of abstract algebra. He began working in ring theory and in 1930 published the K\u00f6the conjecture stating that a sum of two left nil ideals in an arbitrary ring is a nil ideal. By a recommendation of Emmy Noether, he was appointed an assistant of Otto Toeplitz in Bonn University in 1929\u20131930. During this time he began transition to functional analysis. He continued scientific collaboration with Toeplitz for several years afterward.\n K\u00f6the's Habilitationsschrift, Schiefk\u00f6rper unendlichen Ranges \u00fcber dem Zentrum (\"Skew fields of infinite rank over the center\"), was accepted in 1931. He became Privatdozent at University of M\u00fcnster under Heinrich Behnke. During World War II he was involved in coding work. In 1946 he was appointed the director of the Mathematics Institute at the University of Mainz and he served as a dean (1948\u20131950) and a rector of the university (1954\u20131956). In 1957 he became the founding director of the Institute for Applied Mathematics at the University of Heidelberg and served as a rector of the university (1960\u20131961).\n K\u00f6the's best known work has been in the theory of topological vector spaces. In 1960, volume 1 of his seminal monograph Topologische lineare R\u00e4ume was published (the second edition was translated into English in 1969). It was not until 1979 that volume 2 appeared, this time written in English. He also made contributions to the theory of lattices.\n ", "tags": ["20th-century German mathematicians", "Scientists from Graz", "1905 births", "1989 deaths", "Algebraists", "Functional analysts", "Topologists", "Austrian mathematicians", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Gottfried K\u00f6theGottfried K\u00f6the, Hagemann,[1] Otto Toeplitz, 1930Born(1905-12-25)December 25, 1905GrazDiedApril 30, 1989(1989-04-30) (aged\u00a083)FrankfurtScientific careerThesisBeitr\u00e4ge zu Finslers Grundlegung der Mengenlehre\u00a0(1927)Doctoral advisorsTonio Rella, Robert Daublewsky von SterneckDoctoral studentsElisabeth Hagemann,[2] Werner Hildenbrand, Tosun Terzio\u011flu, Joseph Wloka\u00a0[de]\n\nGottfried Maria Hugo K\u00f6the (born 25 December 1905 in Graz; died 30 April 1989 in Frankfurt) was an Austrian mathematician working in abstract algebra and functional analysis.\n\nContents\n\n1 Scientific career\n2 Awards and honors\n3 Books\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nScientific career[edit]\nIn 1923 K\u00f6the enrolled in the University of Graz.
