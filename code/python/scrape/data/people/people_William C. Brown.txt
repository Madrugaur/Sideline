Brown (May 22, 1916 \u2013 February 3, 1999) was an American electrical engineer who helped to invent the crossed-field amplifier in the 1950s and also pioneered microwave power transmission in the 1960s.\n Brown received his BSEE from Iowa State University in 1937, and his MSEE from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1941.
