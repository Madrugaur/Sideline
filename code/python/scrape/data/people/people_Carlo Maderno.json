{"name": "Carlo Maderno", "content": "\n Carlo Maderno (Maderna) (1556 \u2013 30 January 1629) was an Italian[1] architect, born in today's Ticino, who is remembered as one of the fathers of Baroque architecture. His fa\u00e7ades of Santa Susanna, St. Peter's Basilica and Sant'Andrea della Valle were of key importance in the evolution of the Italian Baroque. He is often referred to as the brother of sculptor Stefano Maderno, but this is not universally agreed upon.\n Born in Capolago, in today's Ticino, which was at the time a bailiwick of the Swiss Confederacy, Maderno began his career in the marble quarries of the far north, before moving to Rome in 1588 with four of his brothers to assist his uncle Domenico Fontana. He worked initially as a marble cutter, and his background in sculptural workmanship would help mold his architecture. His first solo project, in 1596, was an utterly confident and mature fa\u00e7ade for the ancient church of Santa Susanna (1597\u20131603); it was among the first Baroque fa\u00e7ades to break with the Mannerist conventions that are exemplified in the Ges\u00f9. The structure is a dynamic rhythm of columns and pilasters, with a protruding central bay and condensed central decoration add complexity to the structure. There is an incipient playfulness with the rules of classic design, still maintaining rigor.\n In this period, Maderno reconfigured the new Cerasi Chapel, formerly Foscari, in Santa Maria del Popolo.\n The Santa Susanna fa\u00e7ade won the attention of Pope Paul V, who in about 1603 appointed him chief architect of St Peter's. Maderno was forced to modify Michelangelo's plans for the Basilica and provide designs for an extended nave with a palatial fa\u00e7ade. The fa\u00e7ade (completed 1612) is constructed to allow for Papal blessings from the emphatically enriched balcony above the central door. This forward extension of the basilica (which grew from Michelangelo's Greek cross to the present Latin cross) has been criticized because it blocks the view of the dome when seen from the Piazza and often ignores the fact that the approaching avenue is modern. Maderno did not have as much freedom in designing this building as he had for others structures.\n Most of Maderno's work continued to be the remodelling of existing structures. The only building designed by Maderno (except for the facade) and completed under his supervision was the layout and interior Santa Maria della Vittoria (1608\u201320), where Maderno's work is often ignored in favor of Bernini's Cornaro Chapel and its  Ecstasy of St Theresa.\n Even Maderno's masterpiece, the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle, is not entirely his. There he designed the fa\u00e7ade and executed the dome, the third largest in Rome after St. Peter's and the Pantheon. The church itself had been designed for the Theatines by Giuseppe Francesco Grimaldi and Giacomo della Porta in 1540: it follows a familiar Jesuit plan, cruciform, its wide nave without aisles, with chapels beyond arched openings. The crossing contains the high altar, lit under Maderno's dome (frescoed by Giovanni Lanfranco 1621\u201325) on its high windowed drum. The earliest design is of 1608; construction took from 1621 to 1625. At Maderno's death, the fa\u00e7ade remained half built; it was completed to Maderno's original conception by Carlo Fontana. In this fa\u00e7ade, the standard formula established at Il Ges\u00f9 is given more movement and depth\u2014in the varying planes of the frieze and cornice\u2014and increased chiaroscuro \u2014as in the whole columns embedded in snug dark recesses that outline their profiles with shadow\u2014, and in similar elements that are re-grouped for a tighter, more sprung rhythm.\n His other works include the Roman churches of Ges\u00f9 e Maria, San Giacomo degli Incurabili, Santa Lucia in Selci and San Giovanni dei Fiorentini (where he is buried). In addition, he worked on the Quirinal Palace, the Papal palace in Castel Gandolfo and the Palazzo Barberini and for the Barberini Pope Urban VIII (1628 and completed 1633; much remodeled since). In the Palazzo Barberini at Quattro Fontane, Maderno's work is overshadowed at times by details added by Bernini and Borromini. His design of palaces is best represented by his design of Palazzo Mattei (1598\u20131616).\n Maderno was called upon to design chapels within existing churches, the Chapel of St Lawrence in San Paolo fuori le Mura and the Cappella Caetani in Santa Pudenziana.\n He designed the base supporting the Marian column in front of Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, which later served as a model for numerous Marian columns in many Catholic countries.\n ", "tags": ["Italian Baroque architects", "1556 births", "1629 deaths", "Architects from Ticino", "16th-century Italian architects", "17th-century Italian architects", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from November 2019", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Italian architect\n Carlo Maderno\n\n\n Fa\u00e7ade of St. Peter's Basilica from Rome\nCarlo Maderno (Maderna) (1556 \u2013 30 January 1629) was an Italian[1] architect, born in today's Ticino, who is remembered as one of the fathers of Baroque architecture.
