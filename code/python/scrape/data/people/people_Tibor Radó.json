{"name": "Tibor Rad\u00f3", "content": "Tibor Rad\u00f3 (June 2, 1895 \u2013 December 29, 1965) was a Hungarian mathematician who moved to the  United States after World War I.\n Rad\u00f3 was born in Budapest and between 1913 and 1915 attended the Polytechnic Institute, studying civil engineering. In World War I, he became a First Lieutenant in the Hungarian Army and was captured on the Russian Front. He escaped from a Siberian prisoner camp and, traveling thousands of miles across Arctic wasteland, managed to return to Hungary.\n He received a doctorate from the Franz Joseph University in 1923. He taught briefly at the university and then became a research fellow in Germany for the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1929, he moved to the United States and lectured at Harvard University and the Rice Institute before obtaining a faculty position in the Department of Mathematics at Ohio State University in 1930. In 1935 he was granted American citizenship. In World War II he was a science consultant to the United States government, interrupting his academic career. He became Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at Ohio State University in 1948.\n In the 1920s, he proved that surfaces have an essentially unique triangulation. In 1933, Rad\u00f3 published  \"On the Problem of Plateau\" in which he gave a solution to Plateau's problem, and in 1935, \"Subharmonic Functions\".  His work focused on computer science in the last decade of his life and in May 1962 he published one of his most famous results in the Bell System Technical Journal: the busy beaver function and its non-computability (\"On Non-Computable Functions\").\n He died in New Smyrna Beach, Florida.\n ", "tags": ["1895 births", "1965 deaths", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "Hungarian emigrants to the United States", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Franz Joseph University alumni", "Harvard University staff", "Rice University faculty", "Ohio State University faculty", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Tibor Rad\u00f3Left to right, standing: Frigyes Riesz, B\u00e9la Ker\u00e9kj\u00e1rt\u00f3, Alfr\u00e9d Haar, Gyula K\u0151nig, Rudolf Ortvay\u00a0[hu], on chairs:\nJ\u00f3zsef K\u00fcrsch\u00e1k, George David Birkhoff, O.D.
