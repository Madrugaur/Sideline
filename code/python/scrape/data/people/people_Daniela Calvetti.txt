{"name": "Daniela Calvetti", "content": "Daniela Calvetti is an Italian-American applied mathematician whose work concerns scientific computing, and connects Bayesian statistics to numerical analysis.[1] She is the James Wood Williamson Professor of Mathematics at Case Western Reserve University.\n Calvetti earned a laurea in mathematics at the University of Bologna in 1980. She went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for graduate study in mathematics, earning a master's degree there in 1985 and completing her Ph.D. in 1989.[2] Her dissertation, A Stochastic Round Off Error Analysis for the Fast Fourier Transform, was supervised by John Tolle.[3]\n After taking faculty positions at North Carolina State University, Colorado State University\u2013Pueblo, and the Stevens Institute of Technology, she moved to Case Western Reserve University in 1997. She was given the James Wood Williamson Professorship in 2013.[2]\n With Erkki Somersalo, Calvetti is the co-author of two books, Introduction to Bayesian Scientific Computing: Ten Lectures on Subjective Computing (Springer, 2007)[4] and Computational Mathematical Modeling: An Integrated Approach Across Scales (SIAM, 2013).[5]\n ", "tags": ["21st-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "20th-century Italian mathematicians", "Italian women mathematicians", "University of Bologna alumni", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill alumni", "North Carolina State University faculty", "Colorado State University\u2013Pueblo faculty", "Stevens Institute of Technology faculty", "Case Western Reserve University faculty", "21st-century Italian mathematicians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Living people", "CS1 maint: untitled periodical", "Articles with short description", "Articles with short description added by PearBOT 5", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Year of birth missing (living people)"], "raw": "Italian-American applied mathematician\nDaniela Calvetti is an Italian-American applied mathematician whose work concerns scientific computing, and connects Bayesian statistics to numerical analysis.[1] She is the James Wood Williamson Professor of Mathematics at Case Western Reserve University.\n\nContents\n\n1 Education and career\n2 Books\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nEducation and career[edit]\nCalvetti earned a laurea in mathematics at the University of Bologna in 1980.
