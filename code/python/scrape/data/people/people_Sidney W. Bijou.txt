{"name": "Sidney W. Bijou", "content": "Sidney William Bijou (November 12, 1908 \u2013 June 11, 2009) was an American developmental psychologist who developed an approach of treating childhood disorders using behavioral therapy, in which positive actions were rewarded and negative behaviors were largely ignored, rather than punished.\n Bijou was born in the Arlington neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. He moved to Brooklyn, New York with his family when he was 10 years old.[1] He earned a degree in business administration at the University of Florida in 1933. He was awarded a master's degree in psychology at Columbia University in 1937 and earned his Ph.D. in the field at the University of Iowa in 1941. Together with Joseph Jastak, he developed the Wide Range Achievement Test, a comprehensive assessment of an individual's ability in reading, comprehension, spelling, and mathematics.[2] During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army Air Corps.[1]\n He was hired by Indiana University in 1946, where he spent two years under pioneering behaviorist B. F. Skinner. While other child psychologists had focused on use of techniques such as play therapy to identify the motives and causes of problematic behavior, Bijou used Skinner's behavioral techniques to encourage positive behaviors through such rewards as praise, hugs and pieces of candy. Children who were defiant would be given a time-out and separated from a group activity, with the expectation that the bad behavior would be its own punishment, and that any additional sanctions would not have a positive effect. A child isolated from a group would strive to behave appropriately in order to have the opportunity to rejoin the group.[1]\n He relocated to the University of Washington in 1948, where he applied Skinner's techniques on children at the Institute of Child Development, and wrote several textbooks in the field together with Donald Baer. Studies he performed there showed that encouragement of good behavior would elicit more good behavior even from unruly children. Ole Ivar Lovaas of the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the developers of applied behavior analysis therapy for autism, adapted Bijou's techniques to develop one of the most commonly used techniques of using rewards to enhance social skills of autistic children.[1]\n In 1968, together with Donald Baer, Todd Risley, James Sherman, and Montrose Wolf, he established the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, as a peer-reviewed  journal publishing research about experimental analysis of behavior and its practical applications.[3][4]\n He relocated over the years to the University of Illinois, the University of Arizona (from 1975 to 1993) and the University of Nevada, Reno (from 1993 to 2001), where he established similar behavioral programs.[1][3]\n Bijou died at age 100 on June 11, 2009, after collapsing at his home in Santa Barbara, California. He had moved there to live with his daughter Jude Bijou following his wife's death.[3] He was survived by Jude and a son. His wife died in 2000; they had been married for 67 years.[1]\n His son recalled taking the family car for a joyride when he was 15 years old and being arrested by the police. At the police station, the officers offered several ideas for punishments for the misdeed, but Dr. Bijou rejected them all, stating that \"he's already had punishment enough\". His son recalled the incident, stating that \"sometimes it can pay off to have a psychologist for a father\".[1]\n ", "tags": ["1908 births", "2009 deaths", "American centenarians", "American psychologists", "Child psychologists", "Columbia University alumni", "Indiana University faculty", "People from Baltimore", "People from Brooklyn", "People from Santa Barbara, California", "Warrington College of Business alumni", "University of Iowa alumni", "University of Arizona faculty", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign faculty", "University of Nevada, Reno faculty", "University of Washington faculty", "20th-century psychologists", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from May 2018", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1 errors: missing title", "Articles with hCards", "Articles to be expanded from June 2011", "All articles to be expanded", "Articles using small message boxes", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Sidney BijouBorn(1908-11-12)November 12, 1908Arlington, Baltimore, U.S.DiedJune 11, 2009(2009-06-11) (aged\u00a0100)Santa Barbara, California, U.S.Scientific careerFieldsDevelopmental psychologyInstitutionsUniversity of Arizona\n\nSidney William Bijou (November 12, 1908 \u2013 June 11, 2009) was an American developmental psychologist who developed an approach of treating childhood disorders using behavioral therapy, in which positive actions were rewarded and negative behaviors were largely ignored, rather than punished.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career in psychology\n3 Personal life\n4 Books by Bijou\n5 References\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBijou was born in the Arlington neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland.
