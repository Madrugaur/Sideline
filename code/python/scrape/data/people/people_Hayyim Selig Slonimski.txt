He was among the first to write books on science for a broad Jewish audience, and was the founder of Ha-Tsfira, the first Hebrew-language newspaper with an emphasis on the sciences.[3][4]\n \u1e24ayyim Selig Slonimski was born in Bialystok, in the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Poland), the oldest son of Rabbi Avraham Ya'akov Bishka and Leah (Neches) Bishka.[5] His father belonged to a family of rabbis, writers, publishers and printers, and his mother was the daughter of Rabbi Ye\u1e25iel Neches, an owner of a well-known beit midrash in Bialystok.[6] Slonimski had a traditional Jewish upbringing and Talmudic education; without a formal secular education, Slonimski taught himself mathematics, astronomy, and foreign languages.[7]\n An advocate for the education of Eastern European Jews in the sciences, Slonimski introduced a vocabulary of technical terms created partly by himself into the Hebrew language. At age 24, he finished writing a textbook on mathematics, but due to lack of funds, only the first part of which was published in 1834 under the title Mosedei \u1e24okhmah.[8]:180 The following year, Slonimski released Sefer Kokhva de-Shavit (1835), a collection of essays on Halley's comet and other astronomy-related topics such as the laws of Kepler and Newton's laws of motion.[8]:180\n In 1838, Slonimski settled in Warsaw, where he became acquainted with mathematician and inventor Abraham Stern (1768\u20131842), whose youngest daughter Sarah Gitel he would later marry in 1842. There he published another astronomical work, the highly popular Toldot ha-Shamayim (1838).[9]\n He also tried his hand at the applied sciences, and a number of his technological inventions received recognition and awards.[10] The most notable of his inventions was his calculating machine, created in 1842 based on his tables, which he exhibited to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, and for which he was awarded the 1844 Demidov Prize of 2,500 rubles by the Russian Academy of Sciences.[11][12] He also received a title of honorary citizen, which granted him the right to live outside of the Pale of Settlement to which Jews were normally restricted.[13] In 1844, he published a new formula in Crelle's Journal for calculating the Jewish calendar.[14][15] In 1853 he invented a chemical process for plating iron vessels with lead to prevent corrosion, and in 1856 a device for simultaneously sending multiple telegrams using just one telegraphic wire. The system of multiple telegraphy perfected by Lord Kelvin in 1858 was based on Slonimski's discovery.[16]\n Slonimski lived between 1846 and 1858 in Tomasz\u00f3w Mazowiecki, an industrial town in central Poland. He corresponded with several scientists, notably Alexander von Humboldt, and wrote a sketch of Humboldt's life.\n In February 1862 in Warsaw, Slonimski launched Ha-Tsfira, the first Hebrew newspaper in Poland, and was the publisher, editor, and chief contributor. It ceased publication after six months due to his departure on the eve of the January Uprising from Warsaw to Zhitomir, the capital of the Ukrainian province Volhynia.[17]:6 There Slonimski was appointed as principal of the rabbinical seminary in Zhitomir and as government censor of Hebrew books. After the seminary was closed by the Russian government in 1874, Slonimski resumed the publication of Ha-Tsfira, first in Berlin and then again in Warsaw, after he obtained the necessary permission from the tsarist government.[18] The newspaper would quickly become a central cultural institution of Polish Jewry.[10]\n He died in Warsaw on May 15, 1904.\n In 1952, Josef Stalin made a speech in which, among other things, he claimed that it was a Russian who had beat out America in the 19th century in the development of the telegraph.[19] While Stalin's claim was mocked in the United States, Slonimsky's grandson, the musicologist Nicolas Slonimsky, was able to confirm the accuracy of some of Stalin's claims.[20]\n ", "tags": ["1810 births", "1904 deaths", "People from Bia\u0142ystok", "People from Belostoksky Uyezd", "Polish Orthodox Jews", "Polish inventors", "Jewish inventors", "Inventors of the Russian Empire", "Jewish scholars", "Jewish writers", "Polish mathematicians", "Jewish scientists", "Jewish astronomers", "Demidov Prize laureates", "Writers of the Russian Empire", "Maskilim", "CS1 Hebrew-language sources (he)", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia without a Wikisource reference", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "\u1e24ayyim Selig Slonimski\u1e24ayyim Selig SlonimskiNative name\u05d7\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd\u202c \u05d6\u05b6\u05e2\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d2 \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05df \u05d9\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e7\u05b9\u05d1\u202c \u05e1\u05dc\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05e1\u05e7\u05d9Born(1810-03-31)March 31, 1810Bialystok, Russian Empire (present-day Poland)DiedMay 15, 1904(1904-05-15) (aged\u00a094)Warsaw, Kingdom of PolandResting placeOkopowa Street Jewish CemeteryNotable worksMosedei \u1e24okmah, Sefer Kukba di-Shebit, Toledot ha-ShamayimNotable awardsDemidov Prize (1844)SpouseReiza Rivhas Neches\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01828; div.\u00a01836)\u200b\nSara Gitel Stern\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01842; died\u00a01897)\u200bRelativesAntoni S\u0142onimski (grandson), Mikhail Slonimsky (grandson),[1] Nicolas Slonimsky (grandson)[2]\n\u1e24ayyim Selig ben Ya'akov Slonimski (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd\u202c \u05d6\u05b6\u05e2\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d2 \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05df \u05d9\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e7\u05b9\u05d1\u202c \u05e1\u05dc\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05e1\u05e7\u05d9\u200e) (March 31, 1810 \u2013 May 15, 1904), also known by his acronym \u1e24aZaS (\u05d7\u05d6\u05f4\u05e1\u200e), was a Hebrew publisher, mathematician, astronomer, inventor, science writer, and rabbi.
