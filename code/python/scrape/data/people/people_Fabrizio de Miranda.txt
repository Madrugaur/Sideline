{"name": "Fabrizio de Miranda", "content": "Fabrizio de Miranda (30 October 1926 \u2013 21 January 2015) was an Italian bridges and structural engineer and  university professor.\n He graduated with a degree in civil engineering in 1950 from the University of Naples. Beginning in 1955 he introduced in Italy steel-concrete composite structures, mainly  in the field of bridges. He planned the first motorway viaducts with  steel structure (Coretta, Macinaie, Poggio Palina) on the Autostrada del Sole in Italy (1959). \nIn 1959, he became managing director of the largest Italian steelwork company, \"Costruzioni Metalliche Finsider S.p.A.\" in Milan, which was under his management until 1967. From 1965 until 1996, he was professor of \"Tecnica delle costruzioni\" (structural engineering) at Politecnico di Milano. He  successfully participated  in numerous National and International Design Competitions of bridges including the first prize ex aequo to the International Competition for the Messina Bridge  as member of the Lambertini Group (1969).  He was among the Founders and then President (in 1970\u20131973) of the Italian College of the Steel Structures Technicians (CTA).  In 1968, he founded a Consulting Engineering Firm specializing in the design of Bridges and Structures. During more than fifty years of professional activity, he designed hundreds of structures and bridges. Notable projects include the elevated highways in Genoa (1963\u20131965), in Fiorenza-Milan (1961) and in San Lorenzo-Rome (1969\u20131976), the viaducts and the Indiano Bridge across the Arno river near Florence (1972\u20131978), all in Italy; the Zarate-Brazo Largo Bridges in Argentina (1969\u20131976), and the Rande Bridge in Spain (1973\u20131977).
