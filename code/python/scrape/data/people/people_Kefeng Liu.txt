{"name": "Kefeng Liu", "content": "Kefeng Liu (Chinese: \u5218\u514b\u5cf0; born 12 December 1965), is a Chinese-American mathematician who is known for his contributions to geometric analysis, particularly the geometry, topology and analysis of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and Calabi-Yau manifolds. He is a professor of mathematics at University of California, Los Angeles, as well as the Executive Director of the Center of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University. He is best-known for his collaboration with Bong Lian and Shing-Tung Yau in which they establish some enumerative geometry conjectures motivated by mirror symmetry.\n Liu was born in Kaifeng, Henan province, China. In 1985, Liu received his B.A. in mathematics from the Department of Mathematics of Peking University in Beijing. In 1988, Liu obtained his M.A. from the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Beijing.[citation needed] Liu then went to study in the United States, obtaining a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1993 under Shing-Tung Yau.[1]\n From 1993 to 1996, Liu was C. L. E. Moore Instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 1996 to 2000, Liu was an assistant professor at Stanford University. Liu joined the University of California, Los Angeles faculty in 2000, where he was promoted to full professor in 2002.[2] In September 2003, Liu was appointed as the head of Zhejiang University's mathematics department.[3] Liu is currently the Executive Director of the Center of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University.\n ", "tags": ["1965 births", "Living people", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American science writers", "Chinese science writers", "Educators from Henan", "Harvard University alumni", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty", "Mathematicians from Henan", "Peking University alumni", "People's Republic of China emigrants to the United States", "Sloan Research Fellows", "University of California, Los Angeles faculty", "Writers from Kaifeng", "Zhejiang University faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from October 2020", "Articles with Chinese-language sources (zh)", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Chinese-American mathematician\nKefeng LiuKefeng Liu at Hangzhou in 2004Born (1965-12-12) 12 December 1965 (age\u00a055)Kaifeng, Henan, ChinaNationalityChineseCitizenshipUnited StatesAlma\u00a0materHarvard UniversityChinese Academy of SciencesPeking UniversityAwardsMorningside Gold Medal (2004)Guggenheim Fellow (2002)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyZhejiang UniversityUniversity of California, Los AngelesDoctoral advisorShing-Tung Yau\n\nKefeng Liu (Chinese: \u5218\u514b\u5cf0; born 12 December 1965), is a Chinese-American mathematician who is known for his contributions to geometric analysis, particularly the geometry, topology and analysis of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and Calabi-Yau manifolds.
