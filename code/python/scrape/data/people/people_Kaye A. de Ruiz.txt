Beaver and Barry Arnold.[3]\n De Ruiz held her first teaching position at Roseburg High School in Roseburg, Oregon, where she focused on connecting mathematical concepts to their practical uses by inviting local professionals into her classroom. She also taught adult classes at the Misawa Air Force Base in Japan and, beginning in 1982, began teaching at the United States Air Force Academy, serving as the course director for the differential calculus course at the Academy. She also taught several courses in statistics while at the Academy, maintaining her emphasis on how students can apply the mathematics to solve problems encountered outside of the classroom. De Ruiz spent some time as the chief of the statistics division at the Academy as well.[1]\n De Ruiz was the 1994 recipient of the Louise Hay Award by the Association for Women in Mathematics for her contributions to mathematics education.[1]\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "Mathematics educators", "Southern Oregon University alumni", "Oregon State University alumni", "University of California, Riverside alumni", "United States Air Force Academy faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with topics of unclear notability from September 2020", "All articles with topics of unclear notability", "Academics articles with topics of unclear notability", "Year of birth missing (living people)"], "raw": "Mathematician and educator\nThe topic of this article may not meet Wikipedia's notability guideline for academics.
