After working with Rem Koolhaas, he started two firms, Kees Christiaanse Architects & Planners (KCAP, in Rotterdam) in 1989 and Architects and Planners (ASTOC, in Cologne) in 1990, where he was a partner till 2002. Christiaanse has \"tackled some of the highest profile urban design schemes in the Netherlands, hosting buildings by\" the finest Dutch and several international architects.[1]\n Christiaanse worked with Rem Koolhaas' architecture firm, OMA, where he was made a partner in 1983 at the age of 30,[1] and worked for the firm until 1989. After OMA, he founded Kees Christiaanse Architects and Planners (KCAP, in Rotterdam, 1989) and ASTOC Architects and Planners (in Cologne, 1990);[2] he worked with ASTOC until 2002. He was also artistic director of the Dutch Building Department from 1993 to 1996.[1] From 1996 to 2003 he was a professor of architecture and urban planning at the Technical University of Berlin, and is now the Chair of Architecture and Urbanism in the Institute for Urban Design at ETH in Z\u00fcrich.[3][4]\n Two monographs on Christiaanse's work have been published, and an exhibition of the work done by his firms, \"The City as Loft,\" was held at DeSingel in Antwerp in 2003.[5] He is known for his urban planning work and \"has quietly become the power behind the throne of Dutch architecture.\"[1] He now lives and works in Zurich.\n Christiaanse was the curator of the 4th International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam, and takes on large-scale projects such as the development of neglected areas for the 2012 Summer Olympics.[6] His latest project is the design of a masterplan for an \"engineering campus\" (or \"science park\") in the Bavarian city of Augsburg, a 70-acre (280,000\u00a0m2) project for which the state government (Freistaat Bayern) and the city are contributing 60 million Euros.[7][8]\n Of particular interest to Christiaanse is the modern city, especially its openness or lack thereof.
