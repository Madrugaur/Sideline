There, as well as pure mathematics, she also studied physics and mathematical logic.\n Although she planned a teaching career with the master's degree she earned, her instructors provided support to continue her studies for another year. By that time, violence between anti-Jewish student groups and Jewish counter-protesters in Vilnius had led to the death of a student, so she was sent away to the University of Warsaw, where she studied logic with Alfred Tarski and Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski.[1][4]\n After completing her studies, Seiden became a schoolteacher at a Jewish school from 1932 to 1934. By this time, she had long felt like a second-class citizen in Europe and wished to move to Mandatory Palestine. With the help of recommendations from Tarski and one of her Vilnius professors, she obtained admission to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which allowed her to move there in 1935. In Palestine, she continued her work as a teacher, and studied mathematics at the Hebrew University under Abraham Fraenkel. However, her interest in mathematics diminished as she became involved in the paramilitary Haganah and then worked in the Red Cross during World War II.\n At the end of the war, Seiden came to work for the Palestine Census of Industry and began studying statistics under Aryeh Dvoretzky.[1][4]\nOn the recommendation of Tarski, she entered graduate study in statistics at the University of California, Berkeley in 1947 as an assistant to Jerzy Neyman.
