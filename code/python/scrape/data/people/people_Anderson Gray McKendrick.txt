{"name": "Anderson Gray McKendrick", "content": "\n Lt Col Anderson Gray McKendrick DSc FRSE (8 September 1876 \u2013 30 May 1943) was a Scottish military physician and epidemiologist who pioneered the use of mathematical methods in epidemiology. Irwin (see below) commented on the quality of his work, \"Although an amateur, he was a brilliant mathematician, with a far greater insight than many professionals.\"\n McKendrick was born at 2 Chester Street[1] in Edinburgh the fifth and last child of John Gray McKendrick  FRS, a distinguished physiologist, and his wife, Mary Souttar. His older brother was John Souttar McKendrick FRSE (1874-1946).\n He was educated at Kelvinside Academy then trained as a doctor at the University of Glasgow qualifying MB ChB in 1900.[2] He then was commissioned in the British Army and joined the Indian Medical Service. At the rank of Lt Colonel he led an expedition into Somaliland in 1903/4 as part of what was then known as the Dervish Wars.[3]\n He later worked with Ronald Ross and eventually would continue his work on mathematical epidemiology. His primary interest was in research and he was director of the Pasteur Institute at Kasauli in the Punjab 1914\u20131920.[2] He was invalided home to Britain in 1920 and settled in Edinburgh where he became Superintendent of the Laboratory of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.

He served as the Society's Vice President 1933-36.[5]\n In 1914 he published a paper in which he gave equations for the pure birth process and a particular birth\u2013death process.
