He is most notable for the creation of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, better known by its Russia acronym TRIZ.

He lectured at TRIZ congresses, published articles and books and corresponded with various TRIZ practitioners. He became the founding member and president of the Russian TRIZ Association. A number of his close friends and students have become the most prominent thinkers and teachers of the movement, popularizing TRIZ in Russia and abroad.[citation needed]\n For a long time he published articles on TRIZ, with examples and exercises, in the Soviet popular science magazine Izobretatel i Ratsionalizator (Inventor and Innovator).[citation needed]\n Altshuller left Baku in the early 1990s amidst post-Soviet-breakup violence in the area. He settled in Petrozavodsk (Karelia in north-western Russia) with his wife and granddaughter. As a result, Petrozavodsk became the center of the TRIZ Association.\n He died from complications of Parkinson's disease in 1998.\n Following his release from prison camp in the 1950s, he earned a living as a science fiction writer, under the pseudonym Genrikh Altov (\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0440\u0438\u0445 \u0410\u043b\u044c\u0442\u043e\u0432), often in collaboration with his wife, Valentina Zhuravleva.\n ", "tags": ["1926 births", "1998 deaths", "Deaths from Parkinson's disease", "Patent examiners", "Soviet journalists", "Systems engineers", "Soviet engineers", "Soviet science fiction writers", "People with Parkinson's disease", "People from Tashkent", "Engineers from Baku", "TRIZ", "Soviet novelists", "Soviet male writers", "20th-century male writers", "Soviet Jews", "Soviet essayists", "Writers from Baku", "Use dmy dates from December 2013", "Articles needing additional references from October 2010", "All articles needing additional references", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from January 2016", "CS1 uses Russian-language script (ru)", "CS1 Russian-language sources (ru)", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
