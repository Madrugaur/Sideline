{"name": "Nasir al-Din al-Tusi", "content": "Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-T\u016bs\u012b (Persian: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0633\u06cc\u200e 18 February 1201\u00a0\u2013 26 June 1274), better known as Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (Persian: \u0646\u0635\u06cc\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0633\u06cc\u200e; or simply Tusi /\u02c8tu\u02d0si/[3] in the West), was a Persian polymath, architect, philosopher, physician, scientist, and theologian.[4] Nasir al-Din al-Tusi was a well published author, writing on subjects of math, engineering, prose, and mysticism. Additionally, al-Tusi made several scientific advancements. In astronomy, al-Tusi created very accurate tables of planetary motion, an updated planetary model, and critiques of Ptolemaic astronomy. He also made strides in logic, mathematics but especially trigonometry, biology, and chemistry. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi left behind a great legacy as well. Some consider Tusi one of the greatest scientists of medieval Islam,[5] since he is often considered the creator of trigonometry as a mathematical discipline in its own right.[6][7][8]\nThe  Muslim scholar Ibn Khaldun (1332\u20131406) considered Tusi to be the greatest of the later Persian scholars.[9] There is also reason to believe that he may have influenced Copernican heliocentrism.[10][11][12][13][14][15]\n Nasir al-Din al-Tusi was born in the city of Tus in medieval Khorasan (northeastern Iran) in the year 1201 and began his studies at an early age. In Hamadan and Tus he studied the Quran, hadith, Ja'fari jurisprudence, logic, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, and astronomy.[16]\n He was born into a Sh\u012b\u2018ah family and lost his father at a young age. Fulfilling the wish of his father, the young Muhammad took learning and scholarship very seriously and traveled far and wide to attend the lectures of renowned scholars and acquired knowledge, an exercise highly encouraged in his Islamic faith. At a young age, he moved to Nishapur to study philosophy under Farid al-Din Damad and mathematics under Muhammad Hasib.[17] He met also Attar of Nishapur, the legendary Sufi master who was later killed by  the Mongols, and he attended the lectures of Qutb al-Din al-Misri.\n Nasir-al-Din Tusi writes in his work, Desideratum of the Faithful (Ma\u1e6dl\u016bb al-mu\u02bemin\u012bn),\u201cTo become people of spiritual reality, it is incumbent to fulfill the symbolic elucidation (ta'w\u012bl) of the seven pillars of the religious law (shar\u012b\u02bfat)\u201d. He also explains that fulfilling the religious law is much easier than fulfilling its spiritual interpretation.[18]\n He explains in his book Aghaz u anjam that the sacred accounts of history that we perceive within the bounds of space and time symbolize events that have no such restrictions. They are only expressed in this way so that humans are able to comprehend them.[19]\n In Mosul, al-Tusi studied mathematics and astronomy with Kamal al-Din Yunus (d. AH 639 / AD 1242), a pupil of Sharaf al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b.[1] Later on he corresponded with Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi, the son-in-law of Ibn Arabi, and it seems that mysticism, as propagated by Sufi masters of his time, was not appealing to him. Once the occasion was suitable, he composed his own manual of philosophical Sufism in the form of a small booklet entitled Awsaf al-Ashraf, or \"The Attributes of the Illustrious\".\n As the armies of Genghis Khan swept his homeland, he was employed by the Nizari Ismaili state and, while moving from stronghold to stronghold, made his most important contributions in science,[20] first in those of the Quhistan region under Muhtasham Nasir al-Din Abd al-Rahim ibn Abi Mansur (where he wrote the Nasirean Ethics). He was later sent to the major castles of Alamut and Maymun-Diz to continue his career under Nizari Imam Ala al-Din Muhammad.[21][22] He was captured after the fall of Maymun-Diz to the Mongol forces under Hulagu Khan.[23]\n Nasir al-Din Tusi\u2019s autobiography, The Voyage (Sayr wa-Suluk) explains that a literary devastation such as the devastation of the Alam\u016bt libraries in 1256 would not waver the spirit of the Nizari Ismaili community because they give more importance to the \u201cliving book\u201d (the Imam of the Time) rather than the \u201cwritten word\u201d. Their hearts are attached to the Commander of the Believers (amir al-mu'minin), not just the \u201ccommand\u201d itself. There is always a present living Imam in world, and following him, a believer will never go astray.[24]\n Tusi has about 150 works, of which 25 are in Persian and the remaining are in Arabic,[25] and there is one treatise in Persian, Arabic and Turkish.[26]\n An example from one of his poems:\n Anyone who knows, and knows that he knows,\nmakes the steed of intelligence leap over the vault of heaven.\nAnyone who does not know but knows that he does not know,\ncan bring his lame little donkey to the destination nonetheless.\nAnyone who does not know, and does not know that he does not know,\nis stuck forever in double ignorance.\n During his stay in Nishapur, Tusi established a reputation as an exceptional scholar. Tusi\u2019s prose writing, which numbers over 150 works, represent one of the largest collections by a single Islamic author. Writing in both Arabic and Persian, Nasir al-Din Tusi dealt with both religious (\"Islamic\") topics and non-religious or secular subjects (\"the ancient sciences\").[25] His works include the definitive Arabic versions of the works of Euclid, Archimedes, Ptolemy, Autolycus, and Theodosius of Bithynia.[25]\n Tusi convinced Hulegu Khan to construct an observatory for establishing accurate astronomical tables for better astrological predictions. Beginning in 1259, the Rasad Khaneh observatory was constructed in Azarbaijan, south of the river Aras, and to the west of Maragheh, the capital of the Ilkhanate Empire.[28]\n Based on the observations in this for the time being most advanced observatory, Tusi made very accurate tables of planetary movements as depicted in his book Zij-i ilkhani (Ilkhanic Tables). This book contains astronomical tables for calculating the positions of the planets and the names of the stars. His model for the planetary system is believed to be the most advanced of his time, and was used extensively until the development of the heliocentric model in the time of Nicolaus Copernicus. Between Ptolemy and Copernicus, he is considered by many[who?] to be one of the most eminent astronomers of his time. His famous student Shams al-Din al-Bukhari[2] was the teacher of Byzantine scholar Gregory Chioniades,[29] who had in turn trained astronomer Manuel Bryennios[30] about 1300 in Constantinople.\n For his planetary models, he invented a geometrical technique called a Tusi-couple, which generates linear motion from the sum of two circular motions. He used this technique to replace Ptolemy's problematic equant[31] for many planets, but was unable to find a solution to Mercury, which was solved later by Ibn al-Shatir as well as Ali Qushji.[32]  The Tusi couple was later employed in Ibn al-Shatir's geocentric model and Nicolaus Copernicus' heliocentric Copernican model.[33] He also calculated the value for the annual precession of the equinoxes and contributed to the construction and usage of some astronomical instruments including the astrolabe.\n \u1e6c\u016bs\u012b criticized Ptolemy's use of observational evidence to show that the Earth was at rest, noting that such proofs were not decisive. Although it doesn't mean that he was a supporter of mobility of the earth, as he and his 16th-century commentator al-B\u012brjand\u012b, maintained that the earth's immobility could be demonstrated, only by physical principles found in natural philosophy.[34] Tusi's criticisms of Ptolemy were similar to the arguments later used by Copernicus in 1543 to defend the Earth's rotation.[35]\n About the real essence of the Milky Way, \u1e6c\u016bs\u012b in his Tadhkira writes:\n\"The Milky Way, i.e. the galaxy, is made up of a very large number of small, tightly-clustered stars, which, on account of their concentration and smallness, seem to be cloudy patches. because of this, it was likened to milk in color.\"\n[36]\nThree centuries later the proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the Milky Way and discovered that it is really composed of a huge number of faint stars.[37]\n Nasir al-Din Tusi was a supporter of Avicennian logic, and wrote the following commentary on Avicenna's theory of absolute propositions:\n \"What spurred him to this was that in the assertoric syllogistic Aristotle and others sometimes used contradictories of absolute propositions on the assumption that they are absolute; and that was why so many decided that absolutes did contradict absolutes. When Avicenna had shown this to be wrong, he wanted to develop a method of construing those examples from Aristotle.\"[38] Al-Tusi was the first to write a work on trigonometry independently of astronomy.[39] Al-Tusi, in his Treatise on the Quadrilateral, gave an extensive exposition of spherical trigonometry, distinct from astronomy.[40] It was in the works of Al-Tusi that trigonometry achieved the status of an independent branch of pure mathematics distinct from astronomy, to which it had been linked for so long.[41][42]\n He was the first to list the six distinct cases of a right triangle in spherical trigonometry.[43]\n This followed earlier work by Greek mathematicians such as Menelaus of Alexandria, who wrote a book on spherical trigonometry called Sphaerica, and the earlier Muslim mathematicians Ab\u016b al-Waf\u0101' al-B\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b and Al-Jayyani.\n In his On the Sector Figure, appears the famous law of sines for plane triangles.[44]\n He also stated the law of sines for spherical triangles,[45][46] discovered the law of tangents for spherical triangles, and provided proofs for these laws.[44]\n In his Akhlaq-i Nasiri, Tusi wrote about several biological topics. He defended a version of Aristotle's scala naturae, in which he placed man above animals, plants, minerals, and the elements. He described \"grasses which grow without sowing or cultivation, by the mere mingling of elements,\"[47] as closest to minerals. Among plants, he considered the date-palm as the most highly developed, since \"it only lacks one thing further to reach (the stage of) an animal: to tear itself loose from the soil and to move away in the quest for nourishment.\"[47]\n The lowest animals \"are adjacent to the region of plants: such are those animals which propagate like grass, being incapable of mating [...], e.g. earthworms, and certain insects\".[48] The animals \"which reach the stage of perfection [...] are distinguished by fully developed weapons\", such as antlers, horns, teeth, and claws. Tusi described these organs as adaptations to each species's lifestyle, in a way anticipating natural theology. He continued:\n \"The noblest of the species is that one whose sagacity and perception is such that it accepts discipline and instruction: thus there accrues to it the perfection not originally created in it. Such are the schooled horse and the trained falcon. The greater this faculty grows in it, the more surpassing its rank, until a point is reached where the (mere) observation of action suffices as instruction: thus, when they see a thing, they perform the like of it by mimicry, without training [...]. This is the utmost of the animal degrees, and the first of the degrees of Man in contiguous therewith.\"[49] Thus, in this paragraph, Tusi described different types of learning, recognising observational learning as the most advanced form, and correctly attributing it to certain animals.\n Tusi seems to have perceived man as belonging to the animals, since he stated that \"the Animal Soul [comprising the faculties of perception and movement ...] is restricted to individuals of the animal species\", and that, by possessing a \"Human Soul, [...] mankind is distinguished and particularized among other animals.\"[50]\n Some scholars have interpreted Tusi's biological writings as suggesting that he adhered to some kind of evolutionary theory.[51][52] However, Tusi did not state explicitly that he believed species to change over time.\n Tusi contributed to the field of chemistry, stating an early law of conservation of mass.[53]\n Tusi contributed many writings to the topic of philosophy. Amongst his philosophical work are his disagreements with fellow philosopher Avicenna. His most famous philosophical work is Akhlaq-i nasiri or Nasirean Ethics in English.[54] Within this work he discusses and compares Islamic teachings to the ethics of Aristotle and Plato. Tusi's book became a popular ethical work in the Muslim world, specifically in India and Persia.[55] Tusi's work also left an impact on Shi'ite Islamic theology. His book Targid also called Catharsis is significant in Shi'ite theology.[56] He also contributed five works to the subject of logic; which were highly regarded by his contemporaries and achieved notoriety in the Muslim world.[57]\n A 60-km diameter lunar crater located on the southern hemisphere of the moon is named after him as \"Nasireddin\". A minor planet 10269 Tusi discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1979 is named after him.[58][59] The K. N. Toosi University of Technology in Iran and Observatory of Shamakhy in the Republic of Azerbaijan are also named after him. In February 2013, Google celebrated his 812th birthday with a doodle, which was accessible in its websites with Arabic language calling him al-farsi (the Persian).[60][61] His birthday is also celebrated as Engineer's Day in Iran.[62]\n Some scholars believe that Nicolaus Copernicus may have been influenced by Middle Eastern astronomers due to uncanny similarities between his work and the uncited work of these Islamic scholars, including Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Ibn al-Shatir, Muayyad al-Din al-Urdi, and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi.[10][11][12][13][14][15] al-Tusi specifically, the plagiarism in question comes from similarities in the Tusi couple and Copernicus' geometric method of removing the Equant from mathematical astronomy.[12][14] Not only do both of the methods match geometrically, however, more importantly they both use the same exact lettering system for each vertex; a detail that seems too preternatural to be happenstance.[12][14] Moreover, the fact that several other details of his model also mirror other Islamic scholars bolsters the notion that Copernicus' work may not have been only his own.[14]\n There is no evidence that any of the direct work of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi ever made it to Copernicus, however there is evidence that the mathematics and theories did make the journey to Europe.[10][11] There were Jewish scientists and pilgrims who would make the journey from the Middle East to Europe, bringing with them Middle Eastern scientific ideas to share with their Christian counterparts.[11] While acknowledging that this is not direct evidence that Copernicus has access to al-Tusi's work, it does show that it was possible.[11]  There was just such a Jewish scholar by the name of  Abner of Burgos who wrote a book containing an incomplete version of the Tusi couple that he had learned second hand, which could have been found by Copernicus.[10] It is important to note that his version had no proofs of the geometry either, so if Copernicus had obtained this book he would have had to complete both the proof and mechanism.[10] Additionally, some scholars believe that, if not Jewish thinkers, it could have been transmission from the Islamic school in Maragheh, home to Nasir al-Din al-Tusi's observatory to Muslim Spain.[10][11] From Spain, al-Tusi and other Islamic cosmological theories could spread through Europe.[10][11] Spread of Islamic astronomy from Maragheh Observatory into Europe could have also been possible in the form of Greek translations from Gregory Choniades.[11] There is evidence as to the means of Copernicus acquiring the Tusi couple and suspicious similarities, not only in math but in visual details as well.[10][11][12][13][14][15]\n Despite this circumstantial evidence, there is still no direct proof that Copernicus did plagiarize the work of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and if he did that he did so intentionally.[12][63][64][65] The Tusi couple is not a unique principle, and as the equant was a problematic necessity to preserve circular motion it is possible that more than one astronomer wished to improve on it; to that end, some scholars argue it would not be difficult for an astronomer to use Euclid's own work to derive the Tusi couple on their own, and that Copernicus most likely did this instead of stealing.[63][64] Before Copernicus ever published the work on his geometrical mechanism, he had written at length his dissatisfaction over Ptolemaic astronomy and the use of the equant, so some scholars then purport that it was not unfounded for Copernicus to have rederived the Tusi couple without having seen it as he had clear motive to do so.[64] Also, some scholars that argue Copernicus did commit plagiarism say that by never claiming it as his own, he inherently condemns himself.[65] However, others critique that mathematicians do not normally claim work like other scientists, so declaring a theorem for oneself is an exception and not the norm.[65] Therefore, there is motive and some explanation as to why and how Copernicus did not plagiarize, despite the evidence against him.[63][64][65]\n ", "tags": ["Astronomers of medieval Islam", "Iranian Shia Muslims", "Mathematicians of medieval Islam", "Medieval Persian astronomers", "People from Mashhad", "People from Tus, Iran", "Scientists who worked on qibla determination", "Shia Muslim scholars", "1201 births", "1274 deaths", "13th-century astronomers", "13th-century Persian mathematicians", "13th-century Iranian people", "13th-century Muslim scholars of Islam", "Muslim inventors", "Medieval Persian philosophers", "13th-century philosophers", "Iranian ethicists", "Scholars of the Ilkhanate", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from April 2020", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1: long volume value", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles having different image on Wikidata and Wikipedia", "Articles containing Persian-language text", "All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases", "Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from April 2014", "Articles with Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with TDV\u0130A identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Persian astronomer (1201\u20131274)\nNot to be confused with Sharaf al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b.\nNas\u012br al-D\u012bn T\u016bs\u012bIranian stamp for the 700th anniversary of his deathTitleKhawaja NasirPersonalBorn18 February 1201 Tus, Khurasan, Khwarzamid EmpireDied26 June 1274(1274-06-26) (aged\u00a073) Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Kadhimiya, Baghdad, IlkhanateReligionIslamEthnicityPersianEraIslamic Golden AgeRegionPersiaDenominationShiaCreedAvicennism/TwelverMain interest(s)Kalam, Islamic Philosophy, Astronomy, Mathematics, Biology and Medicine, Physics, ScienceNotable idea(s)Spherical trigonometry, Tusi coupleNotable work(s)Raw\u1e0da-yi Tasl\u012bm, Tajr\u012bd al-'Aqa'id,  Akhlaq-i-Nasri, Zij-i ilkhani, al-Risalah al-Asturlabiyah,  Al-Tadhkirah fi'ilm al-hay'ahTeachersKamal al-Din Yunus[1]Muslim leader\nStudents\nShams al-Din al-Bukhari[2]\n\nInfluenced\u00a0by\nAvicenna, Fakhr al-Din Razi, Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi, Siraj Qumri\n\nInfluenced\nMaitham Al Bahrani, ibn Khaldun, Qutb al-Din Shirazi, Ibn al-Shatir, Copernicus\n\nMuhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-T\u016bs\u012b (Persian: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0633\u06cc\u200e 18 February 1201\u00a0\u2013 26 June 1274), better known as Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (Persian: \u0646\u0635\u06cc\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0633\u06cc\u200e;

Although it doesn't mean that he was a supporter of mobility of the earth, as he and his 16th-century commentator al-B\u012brjand\u012b, maintained that the earth's immobility could be demonstrated, only by physical principles found in natural philosophy.[34] Tusi's criticisms of Ptolemy were similar to the arguments later used by Copernicus in 1543 to defend the Earth's rotation.[35]\nAbout the real essence of the Milky Way, \u1e6c\u016bs\u012b in his Tadhkira writes:\n\"The Milky Way, i.e. the galaxy, is made up of a very large number of small, tightly-clustered stars, which, on account of their concentration and smallness, seem to be cloudy patches. because of this, it was likened to milk in color.\"\n[36]\nThree centuries later the proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the Milky Way and discovered that it is really composed of a huge number of faint stars.[37]\n\nLogic[edit]\nNasir al-Din Tusi was a supporter of Avicennian logic, and wrote the following commentary on Avicenna's theory of absolute propositions:\n\n\"What spurred him to this was that in the assertoric syllogistic Aristotle and others sometimes used contradictories of absolute propositions on the assumption that they are absolute; and that was why so many decided that absolutes did contradict absolutes. When Avicenna had shown this to be wrong, he wanted to develop a method of construing those examples from Aristotle.\"[38]\nMathematics[edit]\n A stamp issued in the republic of Azerbaijan in 2009 honoring Tusi\nAl-Tusi was the first to write a work on trigonometry independently of astronomy.[39] Al-Tusi, in his Treatise on the Quadrilateral, gave an extensive exposition of spherical trigonometry, distinct from astronomy.[40] It was in the works of Al-Tusi that trigonometry achieved the status of an independent branch of pure mathematics distinct from astronomy, to which it had been linked for so long.[41][42]\nHe was the first to list the six distinct cases of a right triangle in spherical trigonometry.[43]\nThis followed earlier work by Greek mathematicians such as Menelaus of Alexandria, who wrote a book on spherical trigonometry called Sphaerica, and the earlier Muslim mathematicians Ab\u016b al-Waf\u0101' al-B\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b and Al-Jayyani.\nIn his On the Sector Figure, appears the famous law of sines for plane triangles.[44]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\nsin\n\u2061\nA\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nb\n\nsin\n\u2061\nB\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nc\n\nsin\n\u2061\nC\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {a}{\\sin A}}={\\frac {b}{\\sin B}}={\\frac {c}{\\sin C}}}\n\n\nHe also stated the law of sines for spherical triangles,[45][46] discovered the law of tangents for spherical triangles, and provided proofs for these laws.[44]\n\nBiology[edit]\nIn his Akhlaq-i Nasiri, Tusi wrote about several biological topics. He defended a version of Aristotle's scala naturae, in which he placed man above animals, plants, minerals, and the elements. He described \"grasses which grow without sowing or cultivation, by the mere mingling of elements,\"[47] as closest to minerals. Among plants, he considered the date-palm as the most highly developed, since \"it only lacks one thing further to reach (the stage of) an animal: to tear itself loose from the soil and to move away in the quest for nourishment.\"[47]\nThe lowest animals \"are adjacent to the region of plants: such are those animals which propagate like grass, being incapable of mating [...], e.g. earthworms, and certain insects\".[48] The animals \"which reach the stage of perfection [...] are distinguished by fully developed weapons\", such as antlers, horns, teeth, and claws. Tusi described these organs as adaptations to each species's lifestyle, in a way anticipating natural theology. He continued:\n\n\"The noblest of the species is that one whose sagacity and perception is such that it accepts discipline and instruction: thus there accrues to it the perfection not originally created in it. Such are the schooled horse and the trained falcon. The greater this faculty grows in it, the more surpassing its rank, until a point is reached where the (mere) observation of action suffices as instruction: thus, when they see a thing, they perform the like of it by mimicry, without training [...]. This is the utmost of the animal degrees, and the first of the degrees of Man in contiguous therewith.\"[49]\nThus, in this paragraph, Tusi described different types of learning, recognising observational learning as the most advanced form, and correctly attributing it to certain animals.\nTusi seems to have perceived man as belonging to the animals, since he stated that \"the Animal Soul [comprising the faculties of perception and movement ...] is restricted to individuals of the animal species\", and that, by possessing a \"Human Soul, [...] mankind is distinguished and particularized among other animals.\"[50]\nSome scholars have interpreted Tusi's biological writings as suggesting that he adhered to some kind of evolutionary theory.[51][52] However, Tusi did not state explicitly that he believed species to change over time.\n\nChemistry[edit]\nTusi contributed to the field of chemistry, stating an early law of conservation of mass.[53]\n\nPhilosophy[edit]\nTusi contributed many writings to the topic of philosophy. Amongst his philosophical work are his disagreements with fellow philosopher Avicenna. His most famous philosophical work is Akhlaq-i nasiri or Nasirean Ethics in English.[54] Within this work he discusses and compares Islamic teachings to the ethics of Aristotle and Plato. Tusi's book became a popular ethical work in the Muslim world, specifically in India and Persia.[55] Tusi's work also left an impact on Shi'ite Islamic theology. His book Targid also called Catharsis is significant in Shi'ite theology.[56] He also contributed five works to the subject of logic; which were highly regarded by his contemporaries and achieved notoriety in the Muslim world.[57]\n\nInfluence and legacy[edit]\nA 60-km diameter lunar crater located on the southern hemisphere of the moon is named after him as \"Nasireddin\". A minor planet 10269 Tusi discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1979 is named after him.[58][59] The K. N. Toosi University of Technology in Iran and Observatory of Shamakhy in the Republic of Azerbaijan are also named after him. In February 2013, Google celebrated his 812th birthday with a doodle, which was accessible in its websites with Arabic language calling him al-farsi (the Persian).[60][61] His birthday is also celebrated as Engineer's Day in Iran.[62]\n\nPossible Influence on Nicolaus Copernicus[edit]\nSome scholars believe that Nicolaus Copernicus may have been influenced by Middle Eastern astronomers due to uncanny similarities between his work and the uncited work of these Islamic scholars, including Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Ibn al-Shatir, Muayyad al-Din al-Urdi, and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi.[10][11][12][13][14][15] al-Tusi specifically, the plagiarism in question comes from similarities in the Tusi couple and Copernicus' geometric method of removing the Equant from mathematical astronomy.[12][14] Not only do both of the methods match geometrically, however, more importantly they both use the same exact lettering system for each vertex; a detail that seems too preternatural to be happenstance.[12][14] Moreover, the fact that several other details of his model also mirror other Islamic scholars bolsters the notion that Copernicus' work may not have been only his own.[14]\nThere is no evidence that any of the direct work of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi ever made it to Copernicus, however there is evidence that the mathematics and theories did make the journey to Europe.[10][11] There were Jewish scientists and pilgrims who would make the journey from the Middle East to Europe, bringing with them Middle Eastern scientific ideas to share with their Christian counterparts.[11] While acknowledging that this is not direct evidence that Copernicus has access to al-Tusi's work, it does show that it was possible.[11]  There was just such a Jewish scholar by the name of  Abner of Burgos who wrote a book containing an incomplete version of the Tusi couple that he had learned second hand, which could have been found by Copernicus.[10] It is important to note that his version had no proofs of the geometry either, so if Copernicus had obtained this book he would have had to complete both the proof and mechanism.[10] Additionally, some scholars believe that, if not Jewish thinkers, it could have been transmission from the Islamic school in Maragheh, home to Nasir al-Din al-Tusi's observatory to Muslim Spain.[10][11] From Spain, al-Tusi and other Islamic cosmological theories could spread through Europe.[10][11] Spread of Islamic astronomy from Maragheh Observatory into Europe could have also been possible in the form of Greek translations from Gregory Choniades.[11] There is evidence as to the means of Copernicus acquiring the Tusi couple and suspicious similarities, not only in math but in visual details as well.[10][11][12][13][14][15]\nDespite this circumstantial evidence, there is still no direct proof that Copernicus did plagiarize the work of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and if he did that he did so intentionally.[12][63][64][65] The Tusi couple is not a unique principle, and as the equant was a problematic necessity to preserve circular motion it is possible that more than one astronomer wished to improve on it; to that end, some scholars argue it would not be difficult for an astronomer to use Euclid's own work to derive the Tusi couple on their own, and that Copernicus most likely did this instead of stealing.[63][64] Before Copernicus ever published the work on his geometrical mechanism, he had written at length his dissatisfaction over Ptolemaic astronomy and the use of the equant, so some scholars then purport that it was not unfounded for Copernicus to have rederived the Tusi couple without having seen it as he had clear motive to do so.[64] Also, some scholars that argue Copernicus did commit plagiarism say that by never claiming it as his own, he inherently condemns himself.[65] However, others critique that mathematicians do not normally claim work like other scientists, so declaring a theorem for oneself is an exception and not the norm.[65] Therefore, there is motive and some explanation as to why and how Copernicus did not plagiarize, despite the evidence against him.[63][64][65]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of modern-day Muslim scholars of Islam\nList of Iranian scientists\nList of Shi'a Muslims\nPersian science\nScience in the medieval Islamic world\nShen Kuo\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\n^ a b Sharaf al-Din al-Muzaffar al-Tusi biography - MacTutor History of Mathematics\n\n^ a b Shams al\u2010D\u012bn al\u2010Bukh\u0101r\u012b at the Mathematics Genealogy Project\n\n^ \"Tusi\".

In Treatise on the quadrilateral al-Tusi gave the first extant exposition of the whole system of plane and spherical trigonometry.

In Treatise on the quadrilateral al-Tusi gave the first extant exposition of the whole system of plane and spherical trigonometry.

While this reasoning may seem backward to today's Western mind, some of Tusi's theories did have merit. For instance, Tusi believed that a body of matter is able to change, but is not able to entirely disappear. He wrote: 'A body of matter cannot disappear completely. It only changes its form, condition, composition, color and other properties and turns into a different complex or elementary matter'.\n\n^ Freely, John (2011).
