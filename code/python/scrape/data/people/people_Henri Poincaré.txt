{"name": "Henri Poincar\u00e9", "content": "\n Albert Einstein[3]\n Jules Henri Poincar\u00e9 (UK: /\u02c8pw\u00e6\u0303k\u0251\u02d0re\u026a/[4] [US: stress final syllable], French:\u00a0[\u0251\u0303\u0281i pw\u025b\u0303ka\u0281e] (listen);[5][6] 29 April 1854\u00a0\u2013 17 July 1912) was a French mathematician, theoretical physicist, engineer, and philosopher of science. He is often described as a polymath, and in mathematics as \"The Last Universalist\",[7] since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime.\n As a mathematician and physicist, he made many original fundamental contributions to pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and celestial mechanics.[8] In his research on the three-body problem, Poincar\u00e9 became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory. He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of topology.\n Poincar\u00e9 made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. Poincar\u00e9 discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Hendrik Lorentz in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell's equations, an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity. In 1905, Poincar\u00e9 first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the Lorentz transformations.\n The Poincar\u00e9 group used in physics and mathematics was named after him.\n Early in the 20th century he formulated the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture that became over time one of the famous unsolved problems in mathematics until it was solved in 2002\u20132003 by Grigori Perelman.\n Poincar\u00e9 was born on 29 April 1854 in Cit\u00e9 Ducale neighborhood, Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle, into an influential French family.[9] His father L\u00e9on Poincar\u00e9 (1828\u20131892) was a professor of medicine at the University of Nancy.[10] His younger sister Aline married the spiritual philosopher \u00c9mile Boutroux. Another notable member of Henri's family was his cousin, Raymond Poincar\u00e9, a fellow member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, who would serve as President of France from 1913 to 1920.[11]\n During his childhood he was seriously ill for a time with diphtheria and received special instruction from his mother, Eug\u00e9nie Launois (1830\u20131897).\n In 1862, Henri entered the Lyc\u00e9e in Nancy (now renamed the Lyc\u00e9e Henri-Poincar\u00e9\u00a0[fr] in his honour, along with Henri Poincar\u00e9 University, also in Nancy). He spent eleven years at the Lyc\u00e9e and during this time he proved to be one of the top students in every topic he studied. He excelled in written composition. His mathematics teacher described him as a \"monster of mathematics\" and he won first prizes in the concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, a competition between the top pupils from all the Lyc\u00e9es across France. His poorest subjects were music and physical education, where he was described as \"average at best\".[12] However, poor eyesight and a tendency towards absentmindedness may explain these difficulties.[13] He graduated from the Lyc\u00e9e in 1871 with a bachelor's degree in letters and sciences.\n During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he served alongside his father in the Ambulance Corps.\n Poincar\u00e9 entered the \u00c9cole Polytechnique as the top qualifier in 1873 and graduated in 1875. There he studied mathematics as a student of Charles Hermite, continuing to excel and publishing his first paper (D\u00e9monstration nouvelle des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'indicatrice d'une surface) in 1874. From November 1875 to June 1878 he studied at the \u00c9cole des Mines, while continuing the study of mathematics in addition to the mining engineering syllabus, and received the degree of ordinary mining engineer in March 1879.[14]\n As a graduate of the \u00c9cole des Mines, he joined the Corps des Mines as an inspector for the Vesoul region in northeast France. He was on the scene of a mining disaster at Magny in August 1879 in which 18 miners died. He carried out the official investigation into the accident in a characteristically thorough and humane way.\n At the same time, Poincar\u00e9 was preparing for his Doctorate in Science in mathematics under the supervision of Charles Hermite. His doctoral thesis was in the field of differential equations. It was named Sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des fonctions d\u00e9finies par les \u00e9quations aux diff\u00e9rences partielles. Poincar\u00e9 devised a new way of studying the properties of these equations. He not only faced the question of determining the integral of such equations, but also was the first person to study their general geometric properties. He realised that they could be used to model the behaviour of multiple bodies in free motion within the solar system. Poincar\u00e9 graduated from the University of Paris in 1879.\n After receiving his degree, Poincar\u00e9 began teaching as junior lecturer in mathematics at the University of Caen in Normandy (in December 1879). At the same time he published his first major article concerning the treatment of a class of automorphic functions.\n There, in Caen, he met his future wife, Louise Poulain d'Andecy and on 20 April 1881, they married. Together they had four children: Jeanne (born 1887), Yvonne (born 1889), Henriette (born 1891), and L\u00e9on (born 1893).\n Poincar\u00e9 immediately established himself among the greatest mathematicians of Europe, attracting the attention of many prominent mathematicians. In 1881 Poincar\u00e9 was invited to take a teaching position at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Paris; he accepted the invitation. During the years of 1883 to 1897, he taught mathematical analysis in \u00c9cole Polytechnique.\n In 1881\u20131882, Poincar\u00e9 created a new branch of mathematics: qualitative theory of differential equations. He showed how it is possible to derive the most important information about the behavior of a family of solutions without having to solve the equation (since this may not always be possible). He successfully used this approach to problems in celestial mechanics and mathematical physics.\n He never fully abandoned his mining career to mathematics. He worked at the Ministry of Public Services as an engineer in charge of northern railway development from 1881 to 1885. He eventually became chief engineer of the Corps de Mines in 1893 and inspector general in 1910.\n Beginning in 1881 and for the rest of his career, he taught at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne). He was initially appointed as the ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences d'analyse (associate professor of analysis).[15] Eventually, he held the chairs of Physical and Experimental Mechanics, Mathematical Physics and Theory of Probability,[16] and Celestial Mechanics and Astronomy.\n In 1887, at the young age of 32, Poincar\u00e9 was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. He became its president in 1906, and was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise on 5 March 1908.\n In 1887, he won Oscar II, King of Sweden's mathematical competition for a resolution of the three-body problem concerning the free motion of multiple orbiting bodies. (See three-body problem section below.)\n In 1893, Poincar\u00e9 joined the French Bureau des Longitudes, which engaged him in the synchronisation of time around the world. In 1897 Poincar\u00e9 backed an unsuccessful proposal for the decimalisation of circular measure, and hence time and longitude.[17] It was this post which led him to consider the question of establishing international time zones and the synchronisation of time between bodies in relative motion. (See work on relativity section below.)\n In 1899, and again more successfully in 1904, he intervened in the trials of Alfred Dreyfus. He attacked the spurious scientific claims of some of the evidence brought against Dreyfus, who was a Jewish officer in the French army charged with treason by colleagues.\n Poincar\u00e9 was the President of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1901 to 1903.[18]\n Poincar\u00e9 had two notable doctoral students at the University of Paris, Louis Bachelier (1900) and Dimitrie Pompeiu (1905).[19]\n In 1912, Poincar\u00e9 underwent surgery for a prostate problem and subsequently died from an embolism on 17 July 1912, in Paris. He was 58 years of age. He is buried in the Poincar\u00e9 family vault in the Cemetery of Montparnasse, Paris.\n A former French Minister of Education, Claude All\u00e8gre, proposed in 2004 that Poincar\u00e9 be reburied in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris, which is reserved for French citizens only of the highest honour.[20]\n Poincar\u00e9 made many contributions to different fields of pure and applied mathematics such as: celestial mechanics, fluid mechanics, optics, electricity, telegraphy, capillarity, elasticity, thermodynamics, potential theory, quantum theory, theory of relativity and physical cosmology.\n He was also a populariser of mathematics and physics and wrote several books for the lay public.\n Among the specific topics he contributed to are the following:\n The problem of finding the general solution to the motion of more than two orbiting bodies in the solar system had eluded mathematicians since Newton's time. This was known originally as the three-body problem and later the n-body problem, where n is any number of more than two orbiting bodies. The n-body solution was considered very important and challenging at the close of the 19th century. Indeed, in 1887, in honour of his 60th birthday, Oscar II, King of Sweden, advised by G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler, established a prize for anyone who could find the solution to the problem. The announcement was quite specific:\n Given a system of arbitrarily many mass points that attract each according to Newton's law, under the assumption that no two points ever collide, try to find a representation of the coordinates of each point as a series in a variable that is some known function of time and for all of whose values the series converges uniformly. In case the problem could not be solved, any other important contribution to classical mechanics would then be considered to be prizeworthy. The prize was finally awarded to Poincar\u00e9, even though he did not solve the original problem. One of the judges, the distinguished Karl Weierstrass, said, \"This work cannot indeed be considered as furnishing the complete solution of the question proposed, but that it is nevertheless of such importance that its publication will inaugurate a new era in the history of celestial mechanics.\" (The first version of his contribution even contained a serious error; for details see the article by Diacu[23] and the book by Barrow-Green[24]). The version finally printed[25] contained many important ideas which led to the theory of chaos. The problem as stated originally was finally solved by Karl F. Sundman for n\u00a0=\u00a03 in 1912 and was generalised to the case of n\u00a0>\u00a03 bodies by Qiudong Wang in the 1990s.\n Poincar\u00e9's work at the Bureau des Longitudes on establishing international time zones led him to consider how clocks at rest on the Earth, which would be moving at different speeds relative to absolute space (or the \"luminiferous aether\"), could be synchronised. At the same time Dutch theorist Hendrik Lorentz was developing Maxwell's theory into a theory of the motion of charged particles (\"electrons\" or \"ions\"), and their interaction with radiation. In 1895 Lorentz had introduced an auxiliary quantity (without physical interpretation) called \"local time\" \n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\n\n=\nt\n\u2212\nv\nx\n\n/\n\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t^{\\prime }=t-vx/c^{2}\\,}\n\n[26]\nand introduced the hypothesis of length contraction to explain the failure of optical and electrical experiments to detect motion relative to the aether (see Michelson\u2013Morley experiment).[27]\nPoincar\u00e9 was a constant interpreter (and sometimes friendly critic) of Lorentz's theory. Poincar\u00e9 as a philosopher was interested in the \"deeper meaning\". Thus he interpreted Lorentz's theory and in so doing he came up with many insights that are now associated with special relativity. In The Measure of Time (1898), Poincar\u00e9 said, \"\nA little reflection is sufficient to understand that all these affirmations have by themselves no meaning. They can have one only as the result of a convention.\" He also argued that scientists have to set the constancy of the speed of light as a postulate to give physical theories the simplest form.[28]\nBased on these assumptions he discussed in 1900 Lorentz's \"wonderful invention\" of local time and remarked that it arose when moving clocks are synchronised by exchanging light signals assumed to travel with the same speed in both directions in a moving frame.[29]\n In 1881 Poincar\u00e9 described hyperbolic geometry in terms of the hyperboloid model, formulating transformations leaving invariant the Lorentz interval \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\nz\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}-z^{2}=-1}\n\n, which makes them mathematically equivalent to the Lorentz transformations in 2+1 dimensions.[30][31] In addition, Poincar\u00e9's other models of hyperbolic geometry (Poincar\u00e9 disk model, Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model) as well as the Beltrami\u2013Klein model can be related to the relativistic velocity space (see Gyrovector space).\n In 1892 Poincar\u00e9 developed a mathematical theory of light including polarization. His vision of the action of polarizers and retarders, acting on a sphere representing polarized states, is called the Poincar\u00e9 sphere.[32] It was shown that the Poincar\u00e9 sphere possesses an underlying Lorentzian symmetry, by which it can be used as a geometrical representation of Lorentz transformations and velocity additions.[33]\n He discussed the \"principle of relative motion\" in two papers in 1900[29][34]\nand named it the principle of relativity in 1904, according to which no physical experiment can discriminate between a state of uniform motion and a state of rest.[35]\nIn 1905 Poincar\u00e9 wrote to Lorentz about Lorentz's paper of 1904, which Poincar\u00e9 described as a \"paper of supreme importance.\" In this letter he pointed out an error Lorentz had made when he had applied his transformation to one of Maxwell's equations, that for charge-occupied space, and also questioned the time dilation factor given by Lorentz.[36]\nIn a second letter to Lorentz, Poincar\u00e9 gave his own reason why Lorentz's time dilation factor was indeed correct after all\u2014it was necessary to make the Lorentz transformation form a group\u2014and he gave what is now known as the relativistic velocity-addition law.[37]\nPoincar\u00e9 later delivered a paper at the meeting of the Academy of Sciences in Paris on 5 June 1905 in which these issues were addressed. In the published version of that he wrote:[38]\n The essential point, established by Lorentz, is that the equations of the electromagnetic field are not altered by a certain transformation (which I will call by the name of Lorentz) of the form:\n and showed that the arbitrary function \n\n\n\n\u2113\n\n(\n\u03b5\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell \\left(\\varepsilon \\right)}\n\n must be unity for all \n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }\n\n (Lorentz had set \n\n\n\n\u2113\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell =1}\n\n by a different argument) to make the transformations form a group. In an enlarged version of the paper that appeared in 1906 Poincar\u00e9 pointed out that the combination \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nz\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\nt\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}}\n\n is invariant. He noted that a Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing \n\n\n\nc\nt\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ct{\\sqrt {-1}}}\n\n as a fourth imaginary coordinate, and he used an early form of four-vectors.[39] Poincar\u00e9 expressed a lack of interest in a four-dimensional reformulation of his new mechanics in 1907, because in his opinion the translation of physics into the language of four-dimensional geometry would entail too much effort for limited profit.[40] So it was Hermann Minkowski who worked out the consequences of this notion in 1907.\n Like others before, Poincar\u00e9 (1900) discovered a relation between mass and electromagnetic energy. While studying the conflict between the action/reaction principle and Lorentz ether theory, he tried to determine whether the center of gravity still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included.[29] He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincar\u00e9 concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious fluid (fluide fictif) with a mass density of E/c2. If the center of mass frame is defined by both the mass of matter and the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible\u2014it's neither created or destroyed\u2014then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But electromagnetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincar\u00e9 assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincar\u00e9 said that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.\n However, Poincar\u00e9's resolution led to a paradox when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a recoil from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincar\u00e9 performed a Lorentz boost (to order v/c) to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.\n Poincar\u00e9 himself came back to this topic in his St. Louis lecture (1904).[35] This time (and later also in 1908) he rejected[41] the possibility that energy carries mass and criticized the ether solution to compensate the above-mentioned problems:\n The apparatus will recoil as if it were a cannon and the projected energy a ball, and that contradicts the principle of Newton, since our present projectile has no mass; it is not matter, it is energy. [..] Shall we say that the space which separates the oscillator from the receiver and which the disturbance must traverse in passing from one to the other, is not empty, but is filled not only with ether, but with air, or even in inter-planetary space with some subtile, yet ponderable fluid; that this matter receives the shock, as does the receiver, at the moment the energy reaches it, and recoils, when the disturbance leaves it? That would save Newton's principle, but it is not true. If the energy during its propagation remained always attached to some material substratum, this matter would carry the light along with it and Fizeau has shown, at least for the air, that there is nothing of the kind. Michelson and Morley have since confirmed this. We might also suppose that the motions of matter proper were exactly compensated by those of the ether; but that would lead us to the same considerations as those made a moment ago. The principle, if thus interpreted, could explain anything, since whatever the visible motions we could imagine hypothetical motions to compensate them. But if it can explain anything, it will allow us to foretell nothing; it will not allow us to choose between the various possible hypotheses, since it explains everything in advance. It therefore becomes useless.  He also discussed two other unexplained effects: (1) non-conservation of mass implied by Lorentz's variable mass \n\n\n\n\u03b3\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\gamma m}\n\n, Abraham's theory of variable mass and Kaufmann's experiments on the mass of fast moving electrons and (2) the non-conservation of energy in the radium experiments of Madame Curie.\n It was Albert Einstein's concept of mass\u2013energy equivalence (1905) that a body losing energy as radiation or heat was losing mass of amount m\u00a0=\u00a0E/c2 that resolved[42] Poincar\u00e9's paradox, without using any compensating mechanism within the ether.[43] The Hertzian oscillator loses mass in the emission process, and momentum is conserved in any frame. However, concerning Poincar\u00e9's solution of the Center of Gravity problem, Einstein noted that Poincar\u00e9's formulation and his own from 1906 were mathematically equivalent.[44]\n In 1905 Henri Poincar\u00e9 first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light.[38] \"Il importait d'examiner cette hypoth\u00e8se de plus pr\u00e8s et en particulier de rechercher quelles modifications elle nous obligerait \u00e0 apporter aux lois de la gravitation. C'est ce que j'ai cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer; j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 d'abord conduit \u00e0 supposer que la propagation de la gravitation n'est pas instantan\u00e9e, mais se fait avec la vitesse de la lumi\u00e8re.\"\n Einstein's first paper on relativity was published three months after Poincar\u00e9's short paper,[38] but before Poincar\u00e9's longer version.[39] Einstein relied on the principle of relativity to derive the Lorentz transformations and used a similar clock synchronisation procedure (Einstein synchronisation) to the one that Poincar\u00e9 (1900) had described, but Einstein's paper was remarkable in that it contained no references at all. Poincar\u00e9 never acknowledged Einstein's work on special relativity. However, Einstein expressed sympathy with Poincar\u00e9's outlook obliquely in a letter to Hans Vaihinger on 3 May 1919, when Einstein considered Vaihinger's general outlook to be close to his own and Poincar\u00e9's to be close to Vaihinger's.[45] In public, Einstein acknowledged Poincar\u00e9 posthumously in the text of a lecture in 1921 called Geometrie und Erfahrung in connection with non-Euclidean geometry, but not in connection with special relativity. A few years before his death, Einstein commented on Poincar\u00e9 as being one of the pioneers of relativity, saying \"Lorentz had already recognised that the transformation named after him is essential for the analysis of Maxwell's equations, and Poincar\u00e9 deepened this insight still further ....\"[46]\n Poincar\u00e9's work in the development of special relativity is well recognised,[42] though most historians stress that despite many similarities with Einstein's work, the two had very different research agendas and interpretations of the work.[47] Poincar\u00e9 developed a similar physical interpretation of local time and noticed the connection to signal velocity, but contrary to Einstein he continued to use the ether-concept in his papers and argued that clocks at rest in the ether show the \"true\" time, and moving clocks show the local time. So Poincar\u00e9 tried to keep the relativity principle in accordance with classical concepts, while Einstein developed a mathematically equivalent kinematics based on the new physical concepts of the relativity of space and time.[48][49][50][51][52]\n While this is the view of most historians, a minority go much further, such as E. T. Whittaker, who held that Poincar\u00e9 and Lorentz were the true discoverers of relativity.[53]\n Poincar\u00e9 introduced group theory to physics, and was the first to study the group of Lorentz transformations.[54] He also made major contributions to the theory of discrete groups and their representations.\n The subject is clearly defined by Felix Klein in his \"Erlangen Program\" (1872): the geometry invariants of arbitrary continuous transformation, a kind of geometry. The term \"topology\" was introduced, as suggested by Johann Benedict Listing, instead of previously used \"Analysis situs\". Some important concepts were introduced by Enrico Betti and Bernhard Riemann. But the foundation of this science, for a space of any dimension, was created by Poincar\u00e9. His first article on this topic appeared in 1894.[55]\n His research in geometry led to the abstract topological definition of homotopy and homology. He also first introduced the basic concepts and invariants of combinatorial topology, such as Betti numbers and the fundamental group. Poincar\u00e9 proved a formula relating the number of edges, vertices and faces of n-dimensional polyhedron (the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 theorem) and gave the first precise formulation of the intuitive notion of dimension.[56]\n Poincar\u00e9 published two now classical monographs, \"New Methods of Celestial Mechanics\" (1892\u20131899) and \"Lectures on Celestial Mechanics\" (1905\u20131910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). They introduced the small parameter method, fixed points, integral invariants, variational equations, the convergence of the asymptotic expansions. Generalizing a theory of Bruns (1887), Poincar\u00e9 showed that the three-body problem is not integrable. In other words, the general solution of the three-body problem can not be expressed in terms of algebraic and transcendental functions through unambiguous coordinates and velocities of the bodies. His work in this area was the first major achievement in celestial mechanics since Isaac Newton.[57]\n These monographs include an idea of Poincar\u00e9, which later became the basis for mathematical \"chaos theory\" (see, in particular, the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem) and the general theory of dynamical systems.\nPoincar\u00e9 authored important works on astronomy for the equilibrium figures of a gravitating rotating fluid. He introduced the important concept of bifurcation points and proved the existence of equilibrium figures such as the non-ellipsoids, including ring-shaped and pear-shaped figures, and their stability. For this discovery, Poincar\u00e9 received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).[58]\n After defending his doctoral thesis on the study of singular points of the system of differential equations, Poincar\u00e9 wrote a series of memoirs under the title \"On curves defined by differential equations\" (1881\u20131882).[59] In these articles, he built a new branch of mathematics, called \"qualitative theory of differential equations\". Poincar\u00e9 showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, yet from the very form of the equation, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found. In particular, Poincar\u00e9 investigated the nature of the trajectories of the integral curves in the plane, gave a classification of singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introduced the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index, and showed that the number of limit cycles is always finite, except for some special cases. Poincar\u00e9 also developed a general theory of integral invariants and solutions of the variational equations. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction \u2013 the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of mathematical physics and celestial mechanics, and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.[60]\n Saddle\n Focus\n Center\u00a0\n Node\n Poincar\u00e9's work habits have been compared to a bee flying from flower to flower. Poincar\u00e9 was interested in the way his mind worked; he studied his habits and gave a talk about his observations in 1908 at the Institute of General Psychology in Paris. He linked his way of thinking to how he made several discoveries.\n The mathematician Darboux claimed he was un intuitif (an intuitive), arguing that this is demonstrated by the fact that he worked so often by visual representation. He did not care about being rigorous and disliked logic.[61] (Despite this opinion, Jacques Hadamard wrote that Poincar\u00e9's research demonstrated marvelous clarity[62] and Poincar\u00e9 himself wrote that he  believed that logic was not a way to invent but a way to structure ideas and that logic limits ideas.)\n Poincar\u00e9's mental organisation was interesting not only to Poincar\u00e9 himself but also to \u00c9douard Toulouse, a psychologist of the Psychology Laboratory of the School of Higher Studies in Paris. Toulouse wrote a book entitled Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1910).[63][64] In it, he discussed Poincar\u00e9's regular schedule:\n These abilities were offset to some extent by his shortcomings:\n In addition, Toulouse stated that most mathematicians worked from principles already established while Poincar\u00e9 started from basic principles each time (O'Connor et al., 2002).\n His method of thinking is well summarised as:\n Habitu\u00e9 \u00e0 n\u00e9gliger les d\u00e9tails et \u00e0 ne regarder que les cimes, il passait de l'une \u00e0 l'autre avec une promptitude surprenante et les faits qu'il d\u00e9couvrait se groupant d'eux-m\u00eames autour de leur centre \u00e9taient instantan\u00e9ment et automatiquement class\u00e9s dans sa m\u00e9moire. (Accustomed to neglecting details and to looking only at mountain tops, he went from one peak to another with surprising rapidity, and the facts he discovered, clustering around their center, were instantly and automatically pigeonholed in his memory.) Poincar\u00e9 was dismayed by Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers, and referred to it as a \"disease\" from which mathematics would eventually be cured.[65]\nPoincar\u00e9 said, \"There is no actual infinite; the Cantorians have forgotten this, and that is why they have fallen into contradiction.\"[66]\n Awards\n Named after him\n Henri Poincar\u00e9 did not receive the Nobel Prize in Physics, but he had influential advocates like Henri Becquerel or committee member G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler.[68][69] The nomination archive reveals that Poincar\u00e9 received a total of 51 nominations between 1904 and 1912, the year of his death.[70] Of the 58 nominations for the 1910 Nobel Prize, 34 named Poincar\u00e9.[70] Nominators included Nobel laureates Hendrik Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman (both of 1902), Marie Curie (of 1903), Albert Michelson (of 1907), Gabriel Lippmann (of 1908) and Guglielmo Marconi (of 1909).[70]\n The fact that renowned theoretical physicists like Poincar\u00e9, Boltzmann or Gibbs were not awarded the Nobel Prize is seen as evidence that the Nobel committee had more regard for experimentation than theory.[71][72] In Poincar\u00e9's case, several of those who nominated him pointed out that the greatest problem was to name a specific discovery, invention, or technique.[68]\n Poincar\u00e9 had philosophical views opposite to those of Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege, who believed that mathematics was a branch of logic. Poincar\u00e9 strongly disagreed, claiming that intuition was the life of mathematics. Poincar\u00e9 gives an interesting point of view in his book Science and Hypothesis:\n For a superficial observer, scientific truth is beyond the possibility of doubt; the logic of science is infallible, and if the scientists are sometimes mistaken, this is only from their mistaking its rule. Poincar\u00e9 believed that arithmetic is synthetic. He argued that Peano's axioms cannot be proven non-circularly with the principle of induction (Murzi, 1998), therefore concluding that arithmetic is a priori synthetic and not analytic. Poincar\u00e9 then went on to say that mathematics cannot be deduced from logic since it is not analytic. His views were similar to those of Immanuel Kant (Kolak, 2001, Folina 1992). He strongly opposed Cantorian set theory, objecting to its use of impredicative definitions[citation needed].\n However, Poincar\u00e9 did not share Kantian views in all branches of philosophy and mathematics. For example, in geometry, Poincar\u00e9 believed that the structure of non-Euclidean space can be known analytically. Poincar\u00e9 held that convention plays an important role in physics. His view (and some later, more extreme versions of it) came to be known as \"conventionalism\".[73] Poincar\u00e9 believed that Newton's first law was not empirical but is a conventional framework assumption for mechanics (Gargani, 2012).[74] He also believed that the geometry of physical space is conventional. He considered examples in which either the geometry of the physical fields or gradients of temperature can be changed, either describing a space as non-Euclidean measured by rigid rulers, or as a Euclidean space where the rulers are expanded or shrunk by a variable heat distribution. However, Poincar\u00e9 thought that we were so accustomed to Euclidean geometry that we would prefer to change the physical laws to save Euclidean geometry rather than shift to a non-Euclidean physical geometry.[75]\n Poincar\u00e9's famous lectures before the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Psychologie in Paris (published as Science and Hypothesis, The Value of Science, and Science and Method) were cited by Jacques Hadamard as the source for the idea that creativity and invention consist of two mental stages, first random combinations of possible solutions to a problem, followed by a critical evaluation.[76]\n Although he most often spoke of a deterministic universe, Poincar\u00e9 said that the subconscious generation of new possibilities involves chance.\n It is certain that the combinations which present themselves to the mind in a kind of sudden illumination after a somewhat prolonged period of unconscious work are generally useful and fruitful combinations... all the combinations are formed as a result of the automatic action of the subliminal ego, but those only which are interesting find their way into the field of consciousness... A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the subliminal ego, on the contrary, there reigns what I would call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.[77]\n Poincar\u00e9's two stages\u2014random combinations followed by selection\u2014became the basis for Daniel Dennett's two-stage model of free will.[78]\n Popular writings on the philosophy of science:\n On algebraic topology:\n On celestial mechanics:\n On the philosophy of mathematics:\n Other:\n Exhaustive bibliography of English translations:\n Here is a list of theorems proved by Poincar\u00e9:\n \n ", "tags": ["1854 births", "1912 deaths", "19th-century essayists", "19th-century French male writers", "19th-century French mathematicians", "19th-century French non-fiction writers", "19th-century French philosophers", "19th-century mathematicians", "19th-century philosophers", "20th-century essayists", "20th-century French male writers", "20th-century French mathematicians", "20th-century French non-fiction writers", "20th-century French philosophers", "20th-century mathematicians", "20th-century philosophers", "Algebraic geometers", "Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery", "Chaos theorists", "Continental philosophers", "Corps des mines", "Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences", "Deaths from embolism", "Determinists", "Dynamical systems theorists", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni", "Fluid dynamicists", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "French male essayists", "French male non-fiction writers", "French male writers", "French military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War", "French philosophers", "Geometers", "Lecturers", "Mathematical analysts", "Members of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise", "Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Mines ParisTech alumni", "Officers of the French Academy of Sciences", "People from Nancy, France", "Philosophers of logic", "Philosophers of mathematics", "Philosophers of psychology", "Philosophers of science", "Philosophy academics", "Philosophy writers", "Recipients of the Bruce Medal", "Recipients of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society", "French relativity theorists", "Thermodynamicists", "Topologists", "University of Paris faculty", "Recipients of the Matteucci Medal", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from June 2020", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "All articles with incomplete citations", "Articles with incomplete citations from September 2019", "Articles with dead external links from July 2016", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from April 2017", "All articles needing additional references", "Use dmy dates from November 2020", "Biography with signature", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Articles with hAudio microformats", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2018", "Articles with dead external links from May 2020", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from PlanetMath", "CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Articles with LibriVox links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "AC with 27 elements"], "raw": "French mathematician, physicist, engineer, and philosopher of science\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.

He is often described as a polymath, and in mathematics as \"The Last Universalist\",[7] since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime.\nAs a mathematician and physicist, he made many original fundamental contributions to pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and celestial mechanics.[8] In his research on the three-body problem, Poincar\u00e9 became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory. He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of topology.\nPoincar\u00e9 made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. Poincar\u00e9 discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Hendrik Lorentz in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell's equations, an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity. In 1905, Poincar\u00e9 first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the Lorentz transformations.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 group used in physics and mathematics was named after him.\nEarly in the 20th century he formulated the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture that became over time one of the famous unsolved problems in mathematics until it was solved in 2002\u20132003 by Grigori Perelman.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n\n1.1 Education\n1.2 First scientific achievements\n1.3 Career\n\n1.3.1 Students\n\n\n1.4 Death\n\n\n2 Work\n\n2.1 Summary\n2.2 Three-body problem\n2.3 Work on relativity\n\n2.3.1 Local time\n2.3.2 Principle of relativity and Lorentz transformations\n2.3.3 Mass\u2013energy relation\n2.3.4 Gravitational waves\n2.3.5 Poincar\u00e9 and Einstein\n2.3.6 Assessments on Poincar\u00e9 and relativity\n\n\n2.4 Algebra and number theory\n2.5 Topology\n2.6 Astronomy and celestial mechanics\n2.7 Differential equations and mathematical physics\n\n\n3 Character\n\n3.1 Toulouse's characterisation\n3.2 Attitude towards transfinite numbers\n\n\n4 Honours\n5 Philosophy\n\n5.1 Free will\n\n\n6 Bibliography\n\n6.1 Poincar\u00e9's writings in English translation\n\n\n7 See also\n\n7.1 Concepts\n7.2 Theorems\n7.3 Other\n\n\n8 References\n\n8.1 Footnotes\n8.2 Sources\n\n\n9 Further reading\n\n9.1 Secondary sources to work on relativity\n9.2 Non-mainstream sources\n\n\n10 External links\n\n\nLife[edit]\nPoincar\u00e9 was born on 29 April 1854 in Cit\u00e9 Ducale neighborhood, Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle, into an influential French family.[9] His father L\u00e9on Poincar\u00e9 (1828\u20131892) was a professor of medicine at the University of Nancy.[10] His younger sister Aline married the spiritual philosopher \u00c9mile Boutroux. Another notable member of Henri's family was his cousin, Raymond Poincar\u00e9, a fellow member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, who would serve as President of France from 1913 to 1920.[11]\n\nEducation[edit]\n Plaque on the birthplace of Henri Poincar\u00e9 at house number 117 on the Grande Rue in the city of Nancy\nDuring his childhood he was seriously ill for a time with diphtheria and received special instruction from his mother, Eug\u00e9nie Launois (1830\u20131897).\nIn 1862, Henri entered the Lyc\u00e9e in Nancy (now renamed the Lyc\u00e9e Henri-Poincar\u00e9\u00a0[fr] in his honour, along with Henri Poincar\u00e9 University, also in Nancy). He spent eleven years at the Lyc\u00e9e and during this time he proved to be one of the top students in every topic he studied. He excelled in written composition. His mathematics teacher described him as a \"monster of mathematics\" and he won first prizes in the concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, a competition between the top pupils from all the Lyc\u00e9es across France. His poorest subjects were music and physical education, where he was described as \"average at best\".[12] However, poor eyesight and a tendency towards absentmindedness may explain these difficulties.[13] He graduated from the Lyc\u00e9e in 1871 with a bachelor's degree in letters and sciences.\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he served alongside his father in the Ambulance Corps.\nPoincar\u00e9 entered the \u00c9cole Polytechnique as the top qualifier in 1873 and graduated in 1875. There he studied mathematics as a student of Charles Hermite, continuing to excel and publishing his first paper (D\u00e9monstration nouvelle des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'indicatrice d'une surface) in 1874. From November 1875 to June 1878 he studied at the \u00c9cole des Mines, while continuing the study of mathematics in addition to the mining engineering syllabus, and received the degree of ordinary mining engineer in March 1879.[14]\nAs a graduate of the \u00c9cole des Mines, he joined the Corps des Mines as an inspector for the Vesoul region in northeast France. He was on the scene of a mining disaster at Magny in August 1879 in which 18 miners died. He carried out the official investigation into the accident in a characteristically thorough and humane way.\nAt the same time, Poincar\u00e9 was preparing for his Doctorate in Science in mathematics under the supervision of Charles Hermite. His doctoral thesis was in the field of differential equations. It was named Sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des fonctions d\u00e9finies par les \u00e9quations aux diff\u00e9rences partielles. Poincar\u00e9 devised a new way of studying the properties of these equations. He not only faced the question of determining the integral of such equations, but also was the first person to study their general geometric properties. He realised that they could be used to model the behaviour of multiple bodies in free motion within the solar system. Poincar\u00e9 graduated from the University of Paris in 1879.\n\n The young Henri Poincar\u00e9\nFirst scientific achievements[edit]\nAfter receiving his degree, Poincar\u00e9 began teaching as junior lecturer in mathematics at the University of Caen in Normandy (in December 1879). At the same time he published his first major article concerning the treatment of a class of automorphic functions.\nThere, in Caen, he met his future wife, Louise Poulain d'Andecy and on 20 April 1881, they married. Together they had four children: Jeanne (born 1887), Yvonne (born 1889), Henriette (born 1891), and L\u00e9on (born 1893).\nPoincar\u00e9 immediately established himself among the greatest mathematicians of Europe, attracting the attention of many prominent mathematicians. In 1881 Poincar\u00e9 was invited to take a teaching position at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Paris; he accepted the invitation. During the years of 1883 to 1897, he taught mathematical analysis in \u00c9cole Polytechnique.\nIn 1881\u20131882, Poincar\u00e9 created a new branch of mathematics: qualitative theory of differential equations. He showed how it is possible to derive the most important information about the behavior of a family of solutions without having to solve the equation (since this may not always be possible). He successfully used this approach to problems in celestial mechanics and mathematical physics.\n\nCareer[edit]\nHe never fully abandoned his mining career to mathematics. He worked at the Ministry of Public Services as an engineer in charge of northern railway development from 1881 to 1885. He eventually became chief engineer of the Corps de Mines in 1893 and inspector general in 1910.\nBeginning in 1881 and for the rest of his career, he taught at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne). He was initially appointed as the ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences d'analyse (associate professor of analysis).[15] Eventually, he held the chairs of Physical and Experimental Mechanics, Mathematical Physics and Theory of Probability,[16] and Celestial Mechanics and Astronomy.\nIn 1887, at the young age of 32, Poincar\u00e9 was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. He became its president in 1906, and was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise on 5 March 1908.\nIn 1887, he won Oscar II, King of Sweden's mathematical competition for a resolution of the three-body problem concerning the free motion of multiple orbiting bodies. (See three-body problem section below.)\n\n The Poincar\u00e9 family grave at the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse\nIn 1893, Poincar\u00e9 joined the French Bureau des Longitudes, which engaged him in the synchronisation of time around the world. In 1897 Poincar\u00e9 backed an unsuccessful proposal for the decimalisation of circular measure, and hence time and longitude.[17] It was this post which led him to consider the question of establishing international time zones and the synchronisation of time between bodies in relative motion. (See work on relativity section below.)\nIn 1899, and again more successfully in 1904, he intervened in the trials of Alfred Dreyfus. He attacked the spurious scientific claims of some of the evidence brought against Dreyfus, who was a Jewish officer in the French army charged with treason by colleagues.\nPoincar\u00e9 was the President of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1901 to 1903.[18]\n\nStudents[edit]\nPoincar\u00e9 had two notable doctoral students at the University of Paris, Louis Bachelier (1900) and Dimitrie Pompeiu (1905).[19]\n\nDeath[edit]\nIn 1912, Poincar\u00e9 underwent surgery for a prostate problem and subsequently died from an embolism on 17 July 1912, in Paris. He was 58 years of age. He is buried in the Poincar\u00e9 family vault in the Cemetery of Montparnasse, Paris.\nA former French Minister of Education, Claude All\u00e8gre, proposed in 2004 that Poincar\u00e9 be reburied in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris, which is reserved for French citizens only of the highest honour.[20]\n\nWork[edit]\nSummary[edit]\nPoincar\u00e9 made many contributions to different fields of pure and applied mathematics such as: celestial mechanics, fluid mechanics, optics, electricity, telegraphy, capillarity, elasticity, thermodynamics, potential theory, quantum theory, theory of relativity and physical cosmology.\nHe was also a populariser of mathematics and physics and wrote several books for the lay public.\nAmong the specific topics he contributed to are the following:\n\nalgebraic topology\nthe theory of analytic functions of several complex variables\nthe theory of abelian functions\nalgebraic geometry\nthe Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, proven in 2003 by Grigori Perelman.\nPoincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem\nhyperbolic geometry\nnumber theory\nthe three-body problem\nthe theory of diophantine equations\nelectromagnetism\nthe special theory of relativity\nthe fundamental group\nIn the field of differential equations Poincar\u00e9 has given many results that are critical for the qualitative theory of differential equations, for example the Poincar\u00e9 sphere and the Poincar\u00e9 map.\nPoincar\u00e9 on \"everybody's belief\" in the Normal Law of Errors (see normal distribution for an account of that \"law\")\nPublished an influential paper providing a novel mathematical argument in support of quantum mechanics.[21][22]\nThree-body problem[edit]\nThe problem of finding the general solution to the motion of more than two orbiting bodies in the solar system had eluded mathematicians since Newton's time. This was known originally as the three-body problem and later the n-body problem, where n is any number of more than two orbiting bodies. The n-body solution was considered very important and challenging at the close of the 19th century. Indeed, in 1887, in honour of his 60th birthday, Oscar II, King of Sweden, advised by G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler, established a prize for anyone who could find the solution to the problem. The announcement was quite specific:\n\nGiven a system of arbitrarily many mass points that attract each according to Newton's law, under the assumption that no two points ever collide, try to find a representation of the coordinates of each point as a series in a variable that is some known function of time and for all of whose values the series converges uniformly.\nIn case the problem could not be solved, any other important contribution to classical mechanics would then be considered to be prizeworthy. The prize was finally awarded to Poincar\u00e9, even though he did not solve the original problem. One of the judges, the distinguished Karl Weierstrass, said, \"This work cannot indeed be considered as furnishing the complete solution of the question proposed, but that it is nevertheless of such importance that its publication will inaugurate a new era in the history of celestial mechanics.\" (The first version of his contribution even contained a serious error; for details see the article by Diacu[23] and the book by Barrow-Green[24]). The version finally printed[25] contained many important ideas which led to the theory of chaos. The problem as stated originally was finally solved by Karl F. Sundman for n\u00a0=\u00a03 in 1912 and was generalised to the case of n\u00a0>\u00a03 bodies by Qiudong Wang in the 1990s.\n\nWork on relativity[edit]\n Marie Curie and Poincar\u00e9 talk at the 1911 Solvay Conference\nMain articles: Lorentz ether theory and History of special relativity\nLocal time[edit]\nPoincar\u00e9's work at the Bureau des Longitudes on establishing international time zones led him to consider how clocks at rest on the Earth, which would be moving at different speeds relative to absolute space (or the \"luminiferous aether\"), could be synchronised. At the same time Dutch theorist Hendrik Lorentz was developing Maxwell's theory into a theory of the motion of charged particles (\"electrons\" or \"ions\"), and their interaction with radiation. In 1895 Lorentz had introduced an auxiliary quantity (without physical interpretation) called \"local time\" \n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\n\n=\nt\n\u2212\nv\nx\n\n/\n\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t^{\\prime }=t-vx/c^{2}\\,}\n\n[26]\nand introduced the hypothesis of length contraction to explain the failure of optical and electrical experiments to detect motion relative to the aether (see Michelson\u2013Morley experiment).[27]\nPoincar\u00e9 was a constant interpreter (and sometimes friendly critic) of Lorentz's theory. Poincar\u00e9 as a philosopher was interested in the \"deeper meaning\". Thus he interpreted Lorentz's theory and in so doing he came up with many insights that are now associated with special relativity. In The Measure of Time (1898), Poincar\u00e9 said, \"\nA little reflection is sufficient to understand that all these affirmations have by themselves no meaning. They can have one only as the result of a convention.\" He also argued that scientists have to set the constancy of the speed of light as a postulate to give physical theories the simplest form.[28]\nBased on these assumptions he discussed in 1900 Lorentz's \"wonderful invention\" of local time and remarked that it arose when moving clocks are synchronised by exchanging light signals assumed to travel with the same speed in both directions in a moving frame.[29]\n\nPrinciple of relativity and Lorentz transformations[edit]\nFurther information: History of Lorentz transformations - Poincar\u00e9 (1881) and History of Lorentz transformations - Poincar\u00e9 (1905)\nIn 1881 Poincar\u00e9 described hyperbolic geometry in terms of the hyperboloid model, formulating transformations leaving invariant the Lorentz interval \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\nz\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}-z^{2}=-1}\n\n, which makes them mathematically equivalent to the Lorentz transformations in 2+1 dimensions.[30][31] In addition, Poincar\u00e9's other models of hyperbolic geometry (Poincar\u00e9 disk model, Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model) as well as the Beltrami\u2013Klein model can be related to the relativistic velocity space (see Gyrovector space).\nIn 1892 Poincar\u00e9 developed a mathematical theory of light including polarization. His vision of the action of polarizers and retarders, acting on a sphere representing polarized states, is called the Poincar\u00e9 sphere.[32] It was shown that the Poincar\u00e9 sphere possesses an underlying Lorentzian symmetry, by which it can be used as a geometrical representation of Lorentz transformations and velocity additions.[33]\nHe discussed the \"principle of relative motion\" in two papers in 1900[29][34]\nand named it the principle of relativity in 1904, according to which no physical experiment can discriminate between a state of uniform motion and a state of rest.[35]\nIn 1905 Poincar\u00e9 wrote to Lorentz about Lorentz's paper of 1904, which Poincar\u00e9 described as a \"paper of supreme importance.\" In this letter he pointed out an error Lorentz had made when he had applied his transformation to one of Maxwell's equations, that for charge-occupied space, and also questioned the time dilation factor given by Lorentz.[36]\nIn a second letter to Lorentz, Poincar\u00e9 gave his own reason why Lorentz's time dilation factor was indeed correct after all\u2014it was necessary to make the Lorentz transformation form a group\u2014and he gave what is now known as the relativistic velocity-addition law.[37]\nPoincar\u00e9 later delivered a paper at the meeting of the Academy of Sciences in Paris on 5 June 1905 in which these issues were addressed. In the published version of that he wrote:[38]\n\nThe essential point, established by Lorentz, is that the equations of the electromagnetic field are not altered by a certain transformation (which I will call by the name of Lorentz) of the form:\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\u2032\n\n\n=\nk\n\u2113\n\n(\n\nx\n+\n\u03b5\nt\n\n)\n\n\n,\n\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\n\n=\nk\n\u2113\n\n(\n\nt\n+\n\u03b5\nx\n\n)\n\n\n,\n\n\ny\n\n\u2032\n\n\n=\n\u2113\ny\n,\n\n\nz\n\n\u2032\n\n\n=\n\u2113\nz\n,\n\nk\n=\n1\n\n/\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\u03b5\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{\\prime }=k\\ell \\left(x+\\varepsilon t\\right)\\!,\\;t^{\\prime }=k\\ell \\left(t+\\varepsilon x\\right)\\!,\\;y^{\\prime }=\\ell y,\\;z^{\\prime }=\\ell z,\\;k=1/{\\sqrt {1-\\varepsilon ^{2}}}.}\n\n\nand showed that the arbitrary function \n\n\n\n\u2113\n\n(\n\u03b5\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell \\left(\\varepsilon \\right)}\n\n must be unity for all \n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }\n\n (Lorentz had set \n\n\n\n\u2113\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell =1}\n\n by a different argument) to make the transformations form a group. In an enlarged version of the paper that appeared in 1906 Poincar\u00e9 pointed out that the combination \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nz\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\nt\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}}\n\n is invariant. He noted that a Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing \n\n\n\nc\nt\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ct{\\sqrt {-1}}}\n\n as a fourth imaginary coordinate, and he used an early form of four-vectors.[39] Poincar\u00e9 expressed a lack of interest in a four-dimensional reformulation of his new mechanics in 1907, because in his opinion the translation of physics into the language of four-dimensional geometry would entail too much effort for limited profit.[40] So it was Hermann Minkowski who worked out the consequences of this notion in 1907.\n\nMass\u2013energy relation[edit]\nLike others before, Poincar\u00e9 (1900) discovered a relation between mass and electromagnetic energy. While studying the conflict between the action/reaction principle and Lorentz ether theory, he tried to determine whether the center of gravity still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included.[29] He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincar\u00e9 concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious fluid (fluide fictif) with a mass density of E/c2. If the center of mass frame is defined by both the mass of matter and the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible\u2014it's neither created or destroyed\u2014then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But electromagnetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincar\u00e9 assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincar\u00e9 said that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.\nHowever, Poincar\u00e9's resolution led to a paradox when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a recoil from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincar\u00e9 performed a Lorentz boost (to order v/c) to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.\nPoincar\u00e9 himself came back to this topic in his St. Louis lecture (1904).[35] This time (and later also in 1908) he rejected[41] the possibility that energy carries mass and criticized the ether solution to compensate the above-mentioned problems:\n\nThe apparatus will recoil as if it were a cannon and the projected energy a ball, and that contradicts the principle of Newton, since our present projectile has no mass; it is not matter, it is energy. [..] Shall we say that the space which separates the oscillator from the receiver and which the disturbance must traverse in passing from one to the other, is not empty, but is filled not only with ether, but with air, or even in inter-planetary space with some subtile, yet ponderable fluid; that this matter receives the shock, as does the receiver, at the moment the energy reaches it, and recoils, when the disturbance leaves it? That would save Newton's principle, but it is not true. If the energy during its propagation remained always attached to some material substratum, this matter would carry the light along with it and Fizeau has shown, at least for the air, that there is nothing of the kind. Michelson and Morley have since confirmed this. We might also suppose that the motions of matter proper were exactly compensated by those of the ether; but that would lead us to the same considerations as those made a moment ago. The principle, if thus interpreted, could explain anything, since whatever the visible motions we could imagine hypothetical motions to compensate them. But if it can explain anything, it will allow us to foretell nothing; it will not allow us to choose between the various possible hypotheses, since it explains everything in advance. It therefore becomes useless. \nHe also discussed two other unexplained effects: (1) non-conservation of mass implied by Lorentz's variable mass \n\n\n\n\u03b3\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\gamma m}\n\n, Abraham's theory of variable mass and Kaufmann's experiments on the mass of fast moving electrons and (2) the non-conservation of energy in the radium experiments of Madame Curie.\nIt was Albert Einstein's concept of mass\u2013energy equivalence (1905) that a body losing energy as radiation or heat was losing mass of amount m\u00a0=\u00a0E/c2 that resolved[42] Poincar\u00e9's paradox, without using any compensating mechanism within the ether.[43] The Hertzian oscillator loses mass in the emission process, and momentum is conserved in any frame. However, concerning Poincar\u00e9's solution of the Center of Gravity problem, Einstein noted that Poincar\u00e9's formulation and his own from 1906 were mathematically equivalent.[44]\n\nGravitational waves[edit]\nIn 1905 Henri Poincar\u00e9 first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light.[38] \"Il importait d'examiner cette hypoth\u00e8se de plus pr\u00e8s et en particulier de rechercher quelles modifications elle nous obligerait \u00e0 apporter aux lois de la gravitation. C'est ce que j'ai cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer; j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 d'abord conduit \u00e0 supposer que la propagation de la gravitation n'est pas instantan\u00e9e, mais se fait avec la vitesse de la lumi\u00e8re.\"\n\nPoincar\u00e9 and Einstein[edit]\nEinstein's first paper on relativity was published three months after Poincar\u00e9's short paper,[38] but before Poincar\u00e9's longer version.[39] Einstein relied on the principle of relativity to derive the Lorentz transformations and used a similar clock synchronisation procedure (Einstein synchronisation) to the one that Poincar\u00e9 (1900) had described, but Einstein's paper was remarkable in that it contained no references at all. Poincar\u00e9 never acknowledged Einstein's work on special relativity. However, Einstein expressed sympathy with Poincar\u00e9's outlook obliquely in a letter to Hans Vaihinger on 3 May 1919, when Einstein considered Vaihinger's general outlook to be close to his own and Poincar\u00e9's to be close to Vaihinger's.[45] In public, Einstein acknowledged Poincar\u00e9 posthumously in the text of a lecture in 1921 called Geometrie und Erfahrung in connection with non-Euclidean geometry, but not in connection with special relativity. A few years before his death, Einstein commented on Poincar\u00e9 as being one of the pioneers of relativity, saying \"Lorentz had already recognised that the transformation named after him is essential for the analysis of Maxwell's equations, and Poincar\u00e9 deepened this insight still further ....\"[46]\n\nAssessments on Poincar\u00e9 and relativity[edit]\nFurther information: History of special relativity and Relativity priority dispute\nPoincar\u00e9's work in the development of special relativity is well recognised,[42] though most historians stress that despite many similarities with Einstein's work, the two had very different research agendas and interpretations of the work.[47] Poincar\u00e9 developed a similar physical interpretation of local time and noticed the connection to signal velocity, but contrary to Einstein he continued to use the ether-concept in his papers and argued that clocks at rest in the ether show the \"true\" time, and moving clocks show the local time. So Poincar\u00e9 tried to keep the relativity principle in accordance with classical concepts, while Einstein developed a mathematically equivalent kinematics based on the new physical concepts of the relativity of space and time.[48][49][50][51][52]\nWhile this is the view of most historians, a minority go much further, such as E. T. Whittaker, who held that Poincar\u00e9 and Lorentz were the true discoverers of relativity.[53]\n\nAlgebra and number theory[edit]\nPoincar\u00e9 introduced group theory to physics, and was the first to study the group of Lorentz transformations.[54] He also made major contributions to the theory of discrete groups and their representations.\n\n Topological transformation of a mug into a torus \nTopology[edit]\nThe subject is clearly defined by Felix Klein in his \"Erlangen Program\" (1872): the geometry invariants of arbitrary continuous transformation, a kind of geometry. The term \"topology\" was introduced, as suggested by Johann Benedict Listing, instead of previously used \"Analysis situs\". Some important concepts were introduced by Enrico Betti and Bernhard Riemann. But the foundation of this science, for a space of any dimension, was created by Poincar\u00e9. His first article on this topic appeared in 1894.[55]\nHis research in geometry led to the abstract topological definition of homotopy and homology. He also first introduced the basic concepts and invariants of combinatorial topology, such as Betti numbers and the fundamental group. Poincar\u00e9 proved a formula relating the number of edges, vertices and faces of n-dimensional polyhedron (the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 theorem) and gave the first precise formulation of the intuitive notion of dimension.[56]\n\nAstronomy and celestial mechanics[edit]\n  Chaotic motion in three-body problem (computer simulation).\nPoincar\u00e9 published two now classical monographs, \"New Methods of Celestial Mechanics\" (1892\u20131899) and \"Lectures on Celestial Mechanics\" (1905\u20131910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). They introduced the small parameter method, fixed points, integral invariants, variational equations, the convergence of the asymptotic expansions. Generalizing a theory of Bruns (1887), Poincar\u00e9 showed that the three-body problem is not integrable. In other words, the general solution of the three-body problem can not be expressed in terms of algebraic and transcendental functions through unambiguous coordinates and velocities of the bodies. His work in this area was the first major achievement in celestial mechanics since Isaac Newton.[57]\nThese monographs include an idea of Poincar\u00e9, which later became the basis for mathematical \"chaos theory\" (see, in particular, the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem) and the general theory of dynamical systems.\nPoincar\u00e9 authored important works on astronomy for the equilibrium figures of a gravitating rotating fluid. He introduced the important concept of bifurcation points and proved the existence of equilibrium figures such as the non-ellipsoids, including ring-shaped and pear-shaped figures, and their stability. For this discovery, Poincar\u00e9 received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).[58]\n\nDifferential equations and mathematical physics[edit]\nAfter defending his doctoral thesis on the study of singular points of the system of differential equations, Poincar\u00e9 wrote a series of memoirs under the title \"On curves defined by differential equations\" (1881\u20131882).[59] In these articles, he built a new branch of mathematics, called \"qualitative theory of differential equations\". Poincar\u00e9 showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, yet from the very form of the equation, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found. In particular, Poincar\u00e9 investigated the nature of the trajectories of the integral curves in the plane, gave a classification of singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introduced the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index, and showed that the number of limit cycles is always finite, except for some special cases. Poincar\u00e9 also developed a general theory of integral invariants and solutions of the variational equations. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction \u2013 the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of mathematical physics and celestial mechanics, and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.[60]\n\n\nThe singular points of the integral curves\n\n\n\nSaddle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCenter\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode\n\n\n\n\nCharacter[edit]\n Photographic portrait of H. Poincar\u00e9 by Henri Manuel\nPoincar\u00e9's work habits have been compared to a bee flying from flower to flower. Poincar\u00e9 was interested in the way his mind worked; he studied his habits and gave a talk about his observations in 1908 at the Institute of General Psychology in Paris. He linked his way of thinking to how he made several discoveries.\nThe mathematician Darboux claimed he was un intuitif (an intuitive), arguing that this is demonstrated by the fact that he worked so often by visual representation. He did not care about being rigorous and disliked logic.[61] (Despite this opinion, Jacques Hadamard wrote that Poincar\u00e9's research demonstrated marvelous clarity[62] and Poincar\u00e9 himself wrote that he  believed that logic was not a way to invent but a way to structure ideas and that logic limits ideas.)\n\nToulouse's characterisation[edit]\nPoincar\u00e9's mental organisation was interesting not only to Poincar\u00e9 himself but also to \u00c9douard Toulouse, a psychologist of the Psychology Laboratory of the School of Higher Studies in Paris. Toulouse wrote a book entitled Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1910).[63][64] In it, he discussed Poincar\u00e9's regular schedule:\n\nHe worked during the same times each day in short periods of time. He undertook mathematical research for four hours a day, between 10\u00a0a.m. and noon then again from 5\u00a0p.m. to 7\u00a0p.m.. He would read articles in journals later in the evening.\nHis normal work habit was to solve a problem completely in his head, then commit the completed problem to paper.\nHe was ambidextrous and nearsighted.\nHis ability to visualise what he heard proved particularly useful when he attended lectures, since his eyesight was so poor that he could not see properly what the lecturer wrote on the blackboard.\nThese abilities were offset to some extent by his shortcomings:\n\nHe was physically clumsy and artistically inept.\nHe was always in a rush and disliked going back for changes or corrections.\nHe never spent a long time on a problem since he believed that the subconscious would continue working on the problem while he consciously worked on another problem.\nIn addition, Toulouse stated that most mathematicians worked from principles already established while Poincar\u00e9 started from basic principles each time (O'Connor et al., 2002).\nHis method of thinking is well summarised as:\n\nHabitu\u00e9 \u00e0 n\u00e9gliger les d\u00e9tails et \u00e0 ne regarder que les cimes, il passait de l'une \u00e0 l'autre avec une promptitude surprenante et les faits qu'il d\u00e9couvrait se groupant d'eux-m\u00eames autour de leur centre \u00e9taient instantan\u00e9ment et automatiquement class\u00e9s dans sa m\u00e9moire. (Accustomed to neglecting details and to looking only at mountain tops, he went from one peak to another with surprising rapidity, and the facts he discovered, clustering around their center, were instantly and automatically pigeonholed in his memory.)\u2014\u2009Belliver (1956)\nAttitude towards transfinite numbers[edit]\nPoincar\u00e9 was dismayed by Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers, and referred to it as a \"disease\" from which mathematics would eventually be cured.[65]\nPoincar\u00e9 said, \"There is no actual infinite; the Cantorians have forgotten this, and that is why they have fallen into contradiction.\"[66]\n\nHonours[edit]\nAwards\n\nOscar II, King of Sweden's mathematical competition (1887)\nForeign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (1897)[67]\nAmerican Philosophical Society 1899\nGold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society of London (1900)\nBolyai Prize in 1905\nMatteucci Medal 1905\nFrench Academy of Sciences 1906\nAcad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise 1909\nBruce Medal (1911)\nNamed after him\n\nInstitut Henri Poincar\u00e9 (mathematics and theoretical physics center)\nPoincar\u00e9 Prize (Mathematical Physics International Prize)\nAnnales Henri Poincar\u00e9 (Scientific Journal)\nPoincar\u00e9 Seminar (nicknamed \"Bourbaphy\")\nThe crater Poincar\u00e9 on the Moon\nAsteroid 2021 Poincar\u00e9\nList of things named after Henri Poincar\u00e9\nHenri Poincar\u00e9 did not receive the Nobel Prize in Physics, but he had influential advocates like Henri Becquerel or committee member G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler.[68][69] The nomination archive reveals that Poincar\u00e9 received a total of 51 nominations between 1904 and 1912, the year of his death.[70] Of the 58 nominations for the 1910 Nobel Prize, 34 named Poincar\u00e9.[70] Nominators included Nobel laureates Hendrik Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman (both of 1902), Marie Curie (of 1903), Albert Michelson (of 1907), Gabriel Lippmann (of 1908) and Guglielmo Marconi (of 1909).[70]\nThe fact that renowned theoretical physicists like Poincar\u00e9, Boltzmann or Gibbs were not awarded the Nobel Prize is seen as evidence that the Nobel committee had more regard for experimentation than theory.[71][72] In Poincar\u00e9's case, several of those who nominated him pointed out that the greatest problem was to name a specific discovery, invention, or technique.[68]\n\nPhilosophy[edit]\nPoincar\u00e9 had philosophical views opposite to those of Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege, who believed that mathematics was a branch of logic. Poincar\u00e9 strongly disagreed, claiming that intuition was the life of mathematics. Poincar\u00e9 gives an interesting point of view in his book Science and Hypothesis:\n\nFor a superficial observer, scientific truth is beyond the possibility of doubt; the logic of science is infallible, and if the scientists are sometimes mistaken, this is only from their mistaking its rule.\nPoincar\u00e9 believed that arithmetic is synthetic. He argued that Peano's axioms cannot be proven non-circularly with the principle of induction (Murzi, 1998), therefore concluding that arithmetic is a priori synthetic and not analytic. Poincar\u00e9 then went on to say that mathematics cannot be deduced from logic since it is not analytic. His views were similar to those of Immanuel Kant (Kolak, 2001, Folina 1992). He strongly opposed Cantorian set theory, objecting to its use of impredicative definitions[citation needed].\nHowever, Poincar\u00e9 did not share Kantian views in all branches of philosophy and mathematics. For example, in geometry, Poincar\u00e9 believed that the structure of non-Euclidean space can be known analytically. Poincar\u00e9 held that convention plays an important role in physics. His view (and some later, more extreme versions of it) came to be known as \"conventionalism\".[73] Poincar\u00e9 believed that Newton's first law was not empirical but is a conventional framework assumption for mechanics (Gargani, 2012).[74] He also believed that the geometry of physical space is conventional. He considered examples in which either the geometry of the physical fields or gradients of temperature can be changed, either describing a space as non-Euclidean measured by rigid rulers, or as a Euclidean space where the rulers are expanded or shrunk by a variable heat distribution. However, Poincar\u00e9 thought that we were so accustomed to Euclidean geometry that we would prefer to change the physical laws to save Euclidean geometry rather than shift to a non-Euclidean physical geometry.[75]\n\nFree will[edit]\nPoincar\u00e9's famous lectures before the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Psychologie in Paris (published as Science and Hypothesis, The Value of Science, and Science and Method) were cited by Jacques Hadamard as the source for the idea that creativity and invention consist of two mental stages, first random combinations of possible solutions to a problem, followed by a critical evaluation.[76]\nAlthough he most often spoke of a deterministic universe, Poincar\u00e9 said that the subconscious generation of new possibilities involves chance.\n\n\nIt is certain that the combinations which present themselves to the mind in a kind of sudden illumination after a somewhat prolonged period of unconscious work are generally useful and fruitful combinations... all the combinations are formed as a result of the automatic action of the subliminal ego, but those only which are interesting find their way into the field of consciousness... A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the subliminal ego, on the contrary, there reigns what I would call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.[77]\n\n\nPoincar\u00e9's two stages\u2014random combinations followed by selection\u2014became the basis for Daniel Dennett's two-stage model of free will.[78]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nPoincar\u00e9's writings in English translation[edit]\nPopular writings on the philosophy of science:\n\nPoincar\u00e9, Henri (1902\u20131908), The Foundations of Science, New York: Science Press; reprinted in 1921; This book includes the English translations of Science and Hypothesis (1902), The Value of Science (1905), Science and Method (1908).\n1904.
