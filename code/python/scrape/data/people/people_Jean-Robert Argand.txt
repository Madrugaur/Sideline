In 1806, while managing a bookstore in Paris, he published the idea of geometrical interpretation of complex numbers known as the Argand diagram and is known for the first rigorous proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.\n Jean-Robert Argand was born in Geneva, then Republic of Geneva, to Jacques Argand and Eve Carnac.  His background and education are mostly unknown.  Since his knowledge of mathematics was self-taught and he did not belong to any mathematical organizations, he likely pursued mathematics as a hobby rather than a profession.\n Argand moved to Paris in 1806 with his family and, when managing a bookshop there, privately published his Essai sur une mani\u00e8re de repr\u00e9senter les quantit\u00e9s imaginaires dans les constructions g\u00e9om\u00e9triques (Essay on a method of representing imaginary quantities). In 1813, it was republished in the French journal Annales de Math\u00e9matiques. The Essay discussed a method of graphing complex numbers via analytical geometry.
