Following one year under a DAAD fellowship at Stanford, he did his PhD studies at Karlsruhe as well in 1985.\n Followng a one-year postdoc at Stanford University in Chemical Engineering, Meiburg went to Brown University in 1987 as an assistant professor of Applied Mathematics. In 1990 he went to the University of Southern California as professor of Aerospace Engineering. In 2000 he moved to University of California Santa Barbara as a professor of Mechanical Engineering, where he currently works.
