Little is known about his life, except what is found in the biographies of other scientists[3] and that most mathematicians today can trace their lineage back to him.[4]\n Around 1165, he moved to Damascus and taught mathematics there. He then lived in Aleppo for three years, before moving to Mosul, where he met his most famous disciple Kamal al-Din ibn Yunus (1156-1242). This Kamal al-Din would later become the teacher of another famous mathematician from Tus, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi.[3]\n According to Ibn Abi Usaibi'a, Sharaf al-Din was \"outstanding in geometry and the mathematical sciences, having no equal in his time\".[5][6]\n Al-Tusi has been credited with proposing the idea of a function, however his approach being not very explicit, Algebra's move to the dynamic function was made 5 centuries after him, by Gottfried Leibniz.[7]\nSharaf al-Din used what would later be known as the \"Ruffini-Horner method\" to numerically approximate the root of a cubic equation. He also developed a novel method for determining the conditions under which certain types of cubic equations would have two, one, or no solutions.[8] The equations in question can be written, using modern notation, in the form \u00a0f(x) = c, where \u00a0f(x)\u00a0 is a cubic polynomial in which the coefficient of the cubic term \u00a0x3\u00a0 is \u00a0\u22121, and \u00a0c\u00a0 is positive.  The Muslim mathematicians of the time divided the potentially solvable cases of these equations into five different types, determined by the signs of the other coefficients of \u00a0f(x).[9]  For each of these five types, al-Tusi wrote down an expression \u00a0m\u00a0 for the point where the function \u00a0f(x)\u00a0 attained its maximum, and gave a geometric proof that \u00a0f(x) < f(m)\u00a0 for any positive \u00a0x\u00a0 different from \u00a0m. He then concluded that the equation would have two solutions if \u00a0c < f(m), one solution if \u00a0c = f(m), or none if \u00a0 f(m) < c .[10]\n Al-Tusi gave no indication of how he discovered the expressions \u00a0m\u00a0 for the maxima of the functions \u00a0f(x).[11] Some scholars have concluded that al-Tusi obtained his expressions for these maxima by \"systematically\" taking the derivative of the function \u00a0f(x), and setting it equal to zero.[12] This conclusion has been challenged, however, by others, who point out that al-Tusi nowhere wrote down an expression for the derivative, and suggest other plausible methods by which he could have discovered his expressions for the maxima.[13]\n The quantities \u00a0 D = f(m) \u2212 c\u00a0 which can be obtained from al-Tusi's conditions for the numbers of roots of cubic equations by subtracting one side of these conditions from the other is today called the discriminant of the cubic polynomials obtained by subtracting one side of the corresponding cubic equations from the other. Although al-Tusi always writes these conditions in the forms \u00a0c < f(m), \u00a0c = f(m), or \u00a0 f(m) < c, rather than the corresponding forms \u00a0 D > 0 ,  \u00a0 D = 0 , or \u00a0 D < 0 ,[14] Roshdi Rashed nevertheless considers that his discovery of these conditions demonstrated an understanding of the importance of the discriminant for investigating the solutions of cubic equations.[15]\n Sharaf al-Din analyzed the equation x3 + d = b\u22c5x2 in the form x2 \u22c5 (b - x) = d, stating that the left hand side must at least equal the value of d for the equation to have a solution. He then determined the maximum value of this expression.  A value less than d means no positive solution; a value equal to d corresponds to one solution, while a value greater than d corresponds to two solutions. Sharaf al-Din's analysis of this equation was a notable development in Islamic mathematics, but his work was not pursued any further at that time, neither in the Muslim world nor in Europe.[16]\n Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi's \"Treatise on equations\" has been described as inaugurating the beginning of algebraic geometry.[17]\n Sharaf al-Din invented a linear astrolabe, sometimes called the \"staff of Tusi\". While it was easier to construct and was known in al-Andalus, it did not gain much popularity.[5]\n The main-belt asteroid 7058 Al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b, discovered by Henry E. Holt at Palomar Observatory in 1990, was named in his honor.[18]\n ", "tags": ["1130s births", "1213 deaths", "12th-century Persian mathematicians", "13th-century Persian mathematicians", "Astronomers of medieval Islam", "Astrologers of medieval Islam", "Mathematicians of medieval Islam", "Medieval Persian astronomers", "Medieval Persian astrologers", "12th-century astronomers", "12th-century Iranian people", "13th-century Iranian people", "13th-century astronomers", "12th-century astrologers", "13th-century astrologers", "12th-century Muslims", "13th-century Muslims", "People from Tus, Iran", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Persian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with TDV\u0130A identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Not to be confused with Nasir al-Din al-Tusi.\nSharaf al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012bBornSharaf al-D\u012bn al-Mu\u1e93affar ibn Mu\u1e25ammad ibn al-Mu\u1e93affar al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012bc. 1135Tus, present-day IranDiedc. 1213OccupationMathematicianEraIslamic Golden Age\nSharaf al-D\u012bn al-Mu\u1e93affar ibn Mu\u1e25ammad ibn al-Mu\u1e93affar al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b (Persian: \u0634\u0631\u0641\u200c\u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0638\u0641\u0631 \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0638\u0641\u0631 \u062a\u0648\u0633\u06cc\u200e; c. 1135 \u2013 c. 1213) was an Iranian mathematician and astronomer of the Islamic Golden Age (during the Middle Ages).[1][2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Mathematics\n3 Astronomy\n4 Honours\n5 Notes\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nTusi was probably born in Tus, Iran.

Bibcode:2018arXiv180711704N. apparently the idea of a function was proposed by the Persian mathematician Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi (died 1213/4), though his approach was not very explicit, perhaps because of this point that dealing with functions without symbols is very difficult. Anyhow algebra did not decisively move to the dynamic function substage until the German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz(1646\u20131716).\n\n^ O'Connor & Robertson (1999). To al-Tusi, \"solution\" meant \"positive solution\", since the possibility of zero or negative numbers being considered genuine solutions had yet to be recognised at the time (Hogendijk, 1989, p.71; 1997, p.894; Smith, 1997b, p.69).\n\n^ The five types were:\n a x2 \u2212 x3 = c\n b x \u2212 x3 = c\n b x \u2212 a x2 \u2212 x3 = c\n \u2212b x + a x2 \u2212 x3 = c\n b x + a x2 \u2212 x3 = c\nwhere \u00a0a\u00a0 and \u00a0b\u00a0 are positive numbers (Hogendijk, 1989, p.71).
