{"name": "Pedro Teot\u00f3nio Pereira", "content": "Pedro Teot\u00f3nio Pereira (Lisbon, M\u00e1rtires, 7 November 1902 \u2013 Lisbon, 14 February 1972) was a Portuguese politician and diplomat. He played a decisive role for the Allies, in drawing Spain with Portugal into a neutral peninsular bloc during World War II.\n He was a son of Jo\u00e3o Teot\u00f3nio Pereira, Jr. (Lisbon, 1869 - Lisbon, S\u00e3o Domingos de Benfica, 1948), administrator of the Companhia de Seguros Fidelidade, and wife Virg\u00ednia Hermann von Boetischer (Lisbon, Santa Engr\u00e1cia, 1871 - Lisbon, 1969), paternal grandson of Jo\u00e3o Teot\u00f3nio Pereira (1832\u20131916) and wife Clara Sobral (1840 - Freixo de Espada \u00e0 Cinta, Fornos, 1910) and maternal grandson of the Prussian Maximilian August Hermann von Boetischer, an engineer, linked to the installation of the telephones in Portugal, and wife Maria Jos\u00e9 da Silva. His older brother Lu\u00eds Teot\u00f3nio Pereira was also a politician.\n Teot\u00f3nio Pereira, graduated in Mathematics by the University of Lisbon. After his graduation, with the aim of following his family tradition in the insurance business, he made post-graduation studies in the actuarial science in Switzerland.\n His expertise in life insurance and actuarial science caused him to be called by Salazar to reform the Portuguese social security system. At the end of World War I, a new legislation on compulsory social insurance had been introduced in Portugal, but the lack of scientific studies caused the outcome of the experience of the Portuguese first Republic to be weak. Together with Salazar, Teot\u00f3nio Pereira launched new legislation and established the foundations of the Portuguese Social Security system under the Estado Novo.\n He was one of the main builders of the corporativist politics of the Portuguese Estado Novo dictatorship.[1] He served as subsecretary of State (1933\u20131936) and Minister of Commerce and Industry (1936\u20131937).[1] Unlike Britain, Portugal supported Franco from the outset. In January 1938, Teot\u00f3nio Pereira was appointed by Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar Special Agent of Portuguese government near Francisco Franco's government during the Spanish Civil War and achieved immense prestige and influence.[1] Later, in April 1938, he officially become Portuguese Ambassador to Spain, where he remained throughout World War II.[2]\n Following Salazar's policies Teot\u00f3nio Pereira supported Franco from the very beginning but assumed the complicated role of fighting the influence of both Italians and Germans.[2]\n The prestige and the influence that he gained with the Spanish authorities proved to be of great support to allies during World War II. His role as ambassador the war has been praised both by scholars and his fellow ambassadors. Scholars have used adjectives like brilliant, [1] shrewd and observant [3] and Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood, the British ambassador in Madrid from 1940 to 1944, described in his book \"Ambassador on Special Mission\" Teot\u00f3nio Pereira as an ally and a man of \"outstanding ability and distinction\".[4] Hoare wrote that Teot\u00f3nio Pereira gave him his help and friendship from the day of Hoare's arrival to Madrid in May 1940.[4]\n Among other things, Teot\u00f3nio Pereira, shared with  Salazar a profound attachment to the historic Anglo-Portuguese alliance, and during the war years in Madrid, Teot\u00f3nio Pereira proved himself a good friend of Britain.[4] Mr. Carlton Hayes, then his American colleague in the diplomatic corps wrote of him in his book, Wartime Mission in Spain: \"His strong patriotism was at all times evident as was also his loyalty to the historic Anglo-Portuguese alliance. He recognized, as fully as we did, the danger both to Portugal and to the Allied cause in any Axis intervention in Spain or in any unneutral collaboration of Spain with the Axis. Though he distrusted Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er and heartily disliked the Falange, his long and close association with other influential advisers of General Franco and with large segments of the Spanish people stood us, as well as himself, in good stead.... In his constant endeavor to draw Spain with Portugal into a really neutral Peninsular bloc, he contributed immeasurably, at a time when the British and ourselves had much less influence, toward counteracting the propaganda and pleas of our enemies\".\n Later in the same book, Hayes wrote of a \"prodigious number of refugees\",[5] who began pouring into Spain in November and December 1942. Most were Frenchmen, half starved, without money or clothes, and Hayes wroye of the decisive intervention of Teot\u00f3nio Pereira in favour of 16,000 refugees[6] French military refugees who were trying in 1943 to get from Spain to North Africa in order there to join the Allied forces. In that group were also include Polish, Dutch and Belgian most of whom were soldiers or would-be soldiers. According to Hayes, the Poles in particular were destined to perform brilliant feats in the later Italian campaign.[6]\n In July 1945 he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Spanish Order of Charles III, the most distinguished civil award that can be granted in Spain, restricted to 100 Spanish citizens and very seldomly awarded to foreigners.[7]\n He considered himself a \"faithful servant of Salazar\"[8] and is remembered as one of the main accusers of Aristides de Sousa Mendes.[A]\n He later became Portuguese ambassador in Brazil (1945\u201347), ambassador in Washington (1947\u201350), Ambassador to the Court of St. James, London (1953\u201358) and again in Washington (1961\u201363).\n When Teot\u00f3nio Pereira was named the Portuguese ambassador to Washington, there were protests from members of the Portuguese-American community, who considered him to be an \"extreme nationalist.\".[15]\n As Portugal\u2019s plenipotentiary in Washington he co-signed with President Truman, on 24 August 1949, the document implementing the North Atlantic Treaty.\n He was board member of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation.\n While ambassador in Washington, in 1963, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease which forced him to request an early retirement.\n In 1951, while he was ambassador in Washington, Teot\u00f3nio Pereira invited the Australian Navy official Alan Villiers to get on board  of the schooner Argus, a fine cod fishing four-masted schooner, and to record the last commercial activity ever to make use of sails in ocean-crossings. Villiers ended up publishing a book, \"The Quest Of The Schooner Argus: A voyage to the Grand Banks and Grenland on a modern four masted fishing schooner\".[16] The book was a great success in North America and Europe and was later published in sixteen languages. The Quest of the Schooner Argus made news on the BBC, in the main London newspapers, the National Geographic Magazine, and the New York Times.\n In 1953, Teot\u00f3nio Pereira, together with Bernard Morgan, inspired by the idea of  bringing young cadets and seamen under training together from around the world to compete in a friendly competition, organized the first edition of the Tall Ships' Races that took place in 1956 from Torbay \u2013 south of England \u2013 to Lisbon.[17]\n It was also due to the perseverant mediation of Teot\u00f3nio Pereira that, in 1961, Portugal bought the Sagres the school ship of the Portuguese Navy.[18]\n He married Isabel Maria van Zeller Pereira Palha (Lisbon, Santa Engr\u00e1cia, 26 October 1903 \u2013), daughter of Constantino Nicolau Pereira Palha and wife and cousin Maria do Patroc\u00ednio Pereira Palha van Zeller, of a family of large landowners, and they had three children.\n ", "tags": ["Portuguese diplomats", "1902 births", "1972 deaths", "Government ministers of Portugal", "People from Lisbon", "Portuguese people of German descent", "University of Lisbon alumni", "Ambassadors of Portugal to Spain", "Ambassadors of Portugal to Brazil", "Ambassadors of Portugal to the United States", "Ambassadors of Portugal to the United Kingdom", "CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)", "Harv and Sfn no-target errors", "CS1 Portuguese-language sources (pt)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Portuguese politician and diplomat\nPedro Teot\u00f3nio Pereira (Lisbon, M\u00e1rtires, 7 November 1902 \u2013 Lisbon, 14 February 1972) was a Portuguese politician and diplomat.

[12] Salazar had instructed the consulates in Spain and those in the south of France, Bordeaux, Bayonne, Perpignan, Marseilles, Nice etc., to facilitate transit visas to British citizens. In addition, Teot\u00f3nio Pereira also received complaints from the Spanish authorities. He drove from Madrid to the French-Spanish border. The border was chaotic. In Salazar and Pereira's view, Portuguese neutrality was being compromised by Mendes's actions. Pereira later said that Mendes\u2019s behavior implied such confusion coupled with his disheveled appearance that he immediately informed the Spanish authorities that the visas granted by the Bordeaux consulate were null and void and that Mendes had lost the use of his faculties. Two days later, on June 26, 1940, the Spanish Minister Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er told Pereira that Hitler would no longer tolerate the independent existence of an ally of Britain on the Continent and that Spain would soon be forced to permit passage of German troops to invade Portugal.[13][14] Pereira counteracted with astute diplomatic actions that culminated in an additional protocol to Iberian Pact, signed on 29 July 1940, a key contribution to a neutral Peninsular bloc.\n\n\nSources[edit]\nAlmeida, Joao Miguel, \"Correspond\u00eancia pol\u00edtica entre Oliveira Salazar e Pedro Teot\u00f3nio Pereira (1945-1968)\"- C\u00edrculo de Leitores\u00a0: Temas e Debates\u00a0: Instituto de Hist\u00f3ria Contempor\u00e2nea, 2008, ISBN\u00a09789896440299\nCruz, Manuel Braga da (2004), Pedro Teot\u00f3nio Pereira, Embaixador Portugu\u00eas em Espanha durante as Guerras (PDF) (in Portuguese), Oporto: Estudos de Homenagem a Lu\u00eds Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Ramos, pp.\u00a0429\u2013440, retrieved 18 March 2014\nHayes, Carlton J.H.
