{"name": "Clough Williams-Ellis", "content": "\n Sir Bertram Clough Williams-Ellis, CBE, MC (28 May 1883 \u2013 9 April 1978) was a Welsh architect known chiefly as the creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion in North Wales.\n Clough Williams-Ellis was born in Gayton, Northamptonshire, England, but his family moved back to his father's native North Wales when he was four. The family have strong Welsh roots and Clough Williams-Ellis claimed direct descent from Owain Gwynedd, Prince of North Wales.[1] His father John Clough Williams Ellis (1833\u20131913) was a clergyman and noted mountaineer while his mother Ellen Mabel Greaves (1851\u20131941) was the daughter of the slate mine proprietor John Whitehead Greaves and sister of John Ernest Greaves.[2]\n He was educated at Oundle School in Northamptonshire. Though he read for the natural sciences tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, he never graduated. After a few months at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London in 1903\u201304 (which he located by looking up \"Architecture\" in the London telephone directory), he worked for an architect for a few months before setting up his own practice in London. His first commission was probably Larkbeare, a summer house for Anne Wynne Thackeray in Cumnor, Oxfordshire, in 1903-4 (finished 1907) which he designed whilst a student.\n In 1908 he inherited a small country house, Plas Brondanw, from his father, restoring and embellishing it over the rest of his life, and rebuilding it after a fire in 1951. He served with distinction in the First World War, serving first with the Royal Fusiliers[dubious  \u2013 discuss] and then the Welsh Guards attached to the Tank Corps, with whom he was awarded the Military Cross in the 1918 New Year Honours. \n After the war, he helped John St Loe Strachey (who became his father in law) revive pis\u00e9[1] construction in Britain, building an apple storehouse followed by Harrowhill Copse bungalow at Newlands Corner (photos) using shuttering and rammed earth. During the 1920s, he began work on Portmeirion, later the location for The Prisoner (1967\u201368) TV series.\n A fashionable architect in the inter-war years, Williams-Ellis's other works include buildings at Stowe in Buckinghamshire; groups of cottages at Cornwell, Oxfordshire; Tattenhall in Cheshire; and Cushendun, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Williams-Ellis is also known for his design (in the 1930s) of the former summit building on Snowdon, which \u2013 after unsympathetic alteration in the 1960s and a long-term lack of maintenance \u2013 was described by Prince Charles as \"the highest slum in Wales\".\n During this period Williams-Ellis wrote his book England and the Octopus (published in 1928); its outcry at the urbanization of the countryside and loss of village cohesion inspired a group of young women to form Ferguson's Gang. They took up Williams-Ellis's call for action and from 1927 to 1946 were active in rescuing important, but lesser-known, rural properties from being demolished. Shalford Mill in Surrey, Newtown Old Town Hall on the Isle of Wight and Priory Cottages in Oxfordshire were all successfully saved due to the Gang's fundraising efforts. The Gang endowed these properties and significant tracts of the Cornish coastline to the care of the National Trust. The Gang's mastermind Peggy Pollard (known within the Gang by her pseudonym Bill Stickers) and Williams-Ellis became lifelong friends.[3]\n In 1929 Williams-Ellis bought portrait painter George Romney's house in Hampstead.[4]\n He was a member of the Knickerbocker Club.[5]\n Williams-Ellis served on several government committees concerned with design and conservation and was instrumental in setting up the British national parks after 1945. He wrote and broadcast extensively on architecture, design and the preservation of the rural landscape.\n In 1915 Williams-Ellis married the writer Amabel Strachey. Their son, Christopher Moelwyn Strachey Williams-Ellis (1923\u201313 March 1944), a Lieutenant in the Welsh Guards, was killed in action in Italy during the Second World War and was buried in plot VIII, row C, grave 24 at Minturno War Cemetery.[6] Their elder daughter, Susan Williams-Ellis (1918\u20132007), used the name Portmeirion Pottery for the company she created with her husband in 1961. The second daughter, Charlotte Rachel Anwyl Williams-Ellis (1919\u20132010), was a zoologist and environmentalist with a Cambridge PhD in agricultural science. She married the agriculturalist Lindsay Russell Wallace in 1945, and moved to New Zealand.[7][8]\n Welsh language novelist Robin Llywelyn is his grandson, and fashion designer Rose Fulbright-Vickers is his great-granddaughter.[9] Sculptor David Williams-Ellis, the stepfather of Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, is his great-nephew.[10]\n In 1958 Williams-Ellis was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire \"for public services\".[11] He was made a Knight Bachelor in the New Years Honours List of 1972 \"for services to the preservation of the environment and to architecture\".[12] At the time, he was the oldest person ever to be knighted.[13]\n Sir Clough Williams-Ellis died in April 1978, aged 94. In accordance with his wishes, he was cremated, and his ashes went to make up a marine rocket, which was part of a New Year's Eve firework display over the estuary at Portmeirion some twenty years after his death.\n ", "tags": ["1883 births", "1978 deaths", "People from Gayton, Northamptonshire", "Architects from Northamptonshire", "20th-century Welsh architects", "Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge", "People educated at Oundle School", "Commanders of the Order of the British Empire", "Knights Bachelor", "Recipients of the Military Cross", "Welsh Guards officers", "British Army personnel of World War I", "Royal Fusiliers officers", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from January 2018", "All articles needing additional references", "Use dmy dates from February 2021", "Use British English from March 2012", "Articles with hCards", "All accuracy disputes", "Articles with disputed statements from April 2019", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "English-born Welsh architect\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
