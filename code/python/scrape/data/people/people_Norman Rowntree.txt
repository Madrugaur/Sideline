In the present age of unreason this is a real danger and may be responsible for many of our present ills\".[7] He was a chartered engineer and a fellow of the institution.[5] In 1976 Rowntree was employed by the Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology and, on 8 December, gave the 63rd Thomas Hawksley lecture to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers on the history of water engineering.[5] In August 1986 he wrote an article in the Proceedings of the ICE comparing water resources planning in the United Kingdom with that of New Jersey in the USA.[12]\n \n ", "tags": ["1912 births", "1991 deaths", "British civil engineers", "Presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers", "Knights Bachelor", "Pages containing London Gazette template with parameter supp set to y", "EngvarB from September 2014", "Use dmy dates from September 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nSir Norman RowntreeBornNorman Andrew Forster Rowntree11 March 1912[1]Edmonton, Middlesex, EnglandDied22 July 1991(1991-07-22) (aged\u00a079)[2]Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, EnglandNationalityBritishOccupationEngineerEngineering careerDisciplineCivil engineeringInstitutionsInstitution of Civil Engineers (president)\n\nSir Norman Andrew Forster Rowntree (11 March 1912 \u2013 22 July 1991) was a British civil engineer.\nRowntree was born in London in 1912 and held a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering.[3][4][5] He worked as an engineering consultant for Alcott & Lomax, who would be acquired by Babtie in 2000.[4] During his consulting career he was involved with the construction of water pumping stations.[6] Rowntree was appointed director of the Water Resources Board (WRB), a national water planning body established in 1964.[7] The WRB was dominated by civil engineers and focussed its efforts on implementing structural solutions to water resource problems.[7] Rowntree was a keen proponent of that school of thought, saying in 1962 that \"the solution of water supply problems \u2026 will require the construction and operation of large works and highly\u2010developed technical control\".[7] Under Rowntree's leadership the WRB was able to undertake what was the largest scheme of water planning yet seen in England and Wales.[7]\nRowntree was made a Knight Bachelor in Elizabeth II's 1970 Birthday Honours.[8] Rowntree gave the Institution of Electrical Engineers 1972 Graham Clark Lecture on \"Conservation and use of water resources\" and the same year wrote an article for the Proceedings of the Royal Society B entitled \"Water Resources Management in England and Wales\".[9][10] By 1974, he had become a Professor and, on 2 December that year, was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by City University London.[11]\nRowntree was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) for the November 1975\u201376 session.[3] He used his inaugural presidential address to emphasise that \"the duty remains with engineers and other experts to minimise the range of intangible issues\u2026 the inaccuracy of words and the opportunities of distortion are enormous.
