{"name": "Fritz Ursell", "content": "\n Fritz Joseph Ursell FRS[3] (28 April 1923 \u2013 11 May 2012) was a British mathematician noted for his contributions to fluid mechanics, especially in the area of wave-structure interactions.[5] He held the Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics at the University of Manchester from 1961\u20131990,[6] was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1972 and retired in 1990.[4]\n Ursell came to England as a Jewish[7] refugee in 1937 from Germany.[1][8] From 1941 to 1943 he studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with a bachelor degree in mathematics.\n At the end of 1943 Ursell joined the Admiralty  as a part of a team\u2014headed by George Deacon\u2014whose task is to formulate rules for forecasting waves for the allied landings in Japan. Their findings have become the basis of modern wave-forecasting. Ursell stayed in the Admiralty until 1947. In 1947 he was appointed to a post-doctoral fellowship in applied mathematics\nat Manchester University without a doctorate. In 1950 he returned to Cambridge as a lecturer. There he met G. I. Taylor. In 1957 he spent a year at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, having been invited by Arthur Ippen. In 1961 Ursell moved back to Manchester.[9]\n In 1994 Ursell was awarded the Gold Medal of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications in recognition of his \"outstanding contributions to mathematics and its applications over a period of years\".[10]\n Fritz Ursell was married to Katharina Renate Zander in 1959.
