{"name": "Bathsheba Grossman", "content": "Bathsheba Grossman (born 1966) is an American artist who creates sculptures using computer-aided design and three-dimensional modeling, with metal printing technology to produce sculpture in bronze and stainless steel. Her bronze sculptures are primarily mathematical in nature, often depicting intricate patterns or mathematical oddities (for instance, a figure with only one side but three edges).  Her website also has crystals that have been laser etched with three-dimensional patterns, including models of nearby stars, the DNA macromolecule, and the Milky Way Galaxy.\n Grossman's works have featured in art galleries around the world, as well as The New York Times, and the television series Numb3rs and Heroes. In July 2012, her work The Rygo was installed in the VanDusen Botanical Garden in Vancouver; at 2 meters high, as of the time of installation it is the largest 3D print in North America.[1]\n She studied under sculptor Erwin Hauer at Yale University as a mathematics undergraduate, and later with Robert Engman at the University of Pennsylvania.\n Grossman's father was born Jewish[2] and her mother was raised Anglican,[3]\n Her brothers are the writers Austin Grossman and Lev Grossman.
