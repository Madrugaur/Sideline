{"name": "Ivan Fesenko", "content": "\n Ivan Fesenko is a mathematician working in number theory and its interaction with other areas of modern mathematics.[1]\n Fesenko was educated at St. Petersburg State University where he was awarded a PhD in 1987.[1]\n Fesenko  was awarded the Prize of the Petersburg Mathematical Society[2] in 1992. Since 1995, he is professor in pure mathematics at University of Nottingham.\n He contributed to several areas of number theory such as class field theory and its generalizations, as well as to various related developments in pure mathematics.\n Since 2015, he is the principal investigator of Nottingham-Oxford-EPSRC Programme Grant \"Symmetries and Correspondences\".[3]\n Fesenko contributed to explicit formulas for the generalized Hilbert symbol on local fields and higher local field,[pub 1]  higher class field theory,[pub 2][pub 3] p-class field theory,[pub 4][pub 5] arithmetic noncommutative local class field theory.[pub 6]\n He coauthored a textbook on local fields[pub 7] and a volume on higher local fields.[pub 8]\n Fesenko discovered a higher Haar measure and integration on various higher local and adelic objects.[pub 9][pub 10] He pioneered the study of zeta functions in higher dimensions by developing his theory of higher adelic zeta integrals. These integrals are defined using the higher Haar measure and objects from higher class field theory.  Fesenko generalized the Iwasawa-Tate theory  from 1-dimensional global fields to 2-dimensional arithmetic surfaces such as proper regular models of elliptic curves over global fields. His theory led to three further developments.\n The first development is the study of functional equation and meromorphic continuation of the Hasse zeta function of a proper regular model of an elliptic curve over a global field. This study led Fesenko to introduce a new mean-periodicity correspondence between the arithmetic zeta functions and mean-periodic elements of the space of smooth functions on the real line of not more than exponential growth at infinity. This correspondence can be viewed as a weaker version of the Langlands correspondence, where L-functions and replaced by zeta functions and automorphicity is replaced by mean-periodicity.[pub 11] This work was followed by a joint work with Suzuki and Ricotta.[pub 12]\n The second development is an application to the generalized Riemann hypothesis, which in this higher theory is reduced to a certain positivity property of small derivatives of the boundary function and to the properties of the spectrum of the Laplace transform of the boundary function.[pub 13][pub 14]\n[4]\n The third development is a higher adelic study of relations between the arithmetic and analytic ranks of an elliptic curve over a global field, which in conjectural form are stated in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for the zeta function of elliptic surfaces.[pub 15][pub 16] This new method uses FIT theory, two adelic structures: the geometric additive adelic structure and the arithmetic multiplicative adelic structure and an interplay between them motivated by higher class field theory. These two adelic structures have some similarity to two symmetries in inter-universal Teichm\u00fcller theory  of Mochizuki.[pub 17]\n His contributions include his analysis of class field theories and their main generalizations.[pub 18]\n In his study of infinite ramification theory, Fesenko introduced a torsion free hereditarily just infinite closed subgroup of the Nottingham group, which was named the Fesenko group.\n Fesenko played an active role in organizing the study of inter-universal Teichm\u00fcller theory of Shinichi Mochizuki. He is the author of a survey[pub 19] and a general article[pub 20] on this theory. He co-organized two international workshops on IUT.[pub 21][pub 22]\n ", "tags": ["1962 births", "20th-century Russian mathematicians", "21st-century Russian mathematicians", "Living people", "Number theorists", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "Wikipedia extended-confirmed-protected pages", "Articles lacking reliable references from July 2018", "All articles lacking reliable references", "BLP articles lacking sources from July 2018", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For the Russian Olympic skier, see Ivan Fesenko (skier).\n\n\nThis biography of a living person relies too much on references to primary sources.
