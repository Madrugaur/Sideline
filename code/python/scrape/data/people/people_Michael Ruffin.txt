{"name": "Michael Ruffin", "content": "Michael David Ruffin (born (1977-01-21)January 21, 1977) is an American former professional basketball player. At 6'8\" and 248\u00a0lbs, he played as a forward/center.\n After playing college basketball at the University of Tulsa, where he studied chemical engineering, Ruffin was drafted in the second round of the 1999 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls. He has played for the Bulls, the Philadelphia 76ers, the Utah Jazz, the Washington Wizards, the Milwaukee Bucks, and the Portland Trail Blazers. He averaged 1.7 points and 3.9 rebounds per game through his NBA career and is considered to be a defensive presence on the court. Ruffin's best statistical season came with the 2000-01 Bulls, where tallied career best averages in rebounding (5.8) and scoring (2.6).\n On March 30, 2007, Ruffin was part of a dubious blooper that indirectly cost the Wizards a game. Up 109-106 on the Toronto Raptors, with less than four seconds remaining in regulation, Ruffin intercepted an inbound pass. In an attempt to run the clock out, Ruffin tossed the ball in the air, but it landed in the hands of Toronto's Morris Peterson, who sank a game-tying three-pointer as time expired. Forced into overtime, Washington lost the game 123-118.\n On February 17, 2009, Ruffin was sent to the Sacramento Kings and then to the Portland Trail Blazers for Ike Diogu shortly thereafter in a 3-team trade.[1]\n In 2010, Ruffin became coach of the ABA's Colorado Kings.[2][3] However, he resumed his career in Spain playing for Obradoiro CAB.[2]\n After two years out of the NBA, Ruffin was signed by the league's Denver Nuggets in mid-December 2011.[2] However, he did not make the team's opening day roster.[4]\n As of 2012, Ruffin was living in Phoenix, Arizona, working for ASQ and coaching basketball.[5]\n Ruffin joined the New Orleans Pelicans as Player Development Coach in October 2014.[6]\n ", "tags": ["1977 births", "Living people", "American expatriate basketball people in Spain", "American men's basketball players", "Basketball players from Colorado", "B\u00e0squet Manresa players", "Centers (basketball)", "Chicago Bulls draft picks", "Chicago Bulls players", "Liga ACB players", "Medalists at the 1997 Summer Universiade", "Milwaukee Bucks players", "Obradoiro CAB players", "Philadelphia 76ers players", "Portland Trail Blazers players", "Power forwards (basketball)", "Sportspeople from Denver", "Tulsa Golden Hurricane men's basketball players", "Utah Jazz players", "Washington Wizards players", "Universiade medalists in basketball", "Universiade gold medalists for the United States", "Webarchive template archiveis links", "Commons category link is on Wikidata"], "raw": "Michael RuffinPersonal informationBorn (1977-01-21) January 21, 1977 (age\u00a044)Denver, ColoradoNationalityAmericanListed height6\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (2.06\u00a0m)Listed weight246\u00a0lb (112\u00a0kg)Career informationHigh schoolCherry Creek (Englewood, Colorado)CollegeTulsa (1995\u20131999)NBA draft1999 / Round: 2 / Pick: 32nd overallSelected by the Chicago BullsPlaying career1999\u20132011PositionPower forward / CenterNumber51Career history1999\u20132001Chicago Bulls2001\u20132002Philadelphia 76ers2002\u20132003Caprabo Lleida2003\u20132004Utah Jazz2004\u20132007Washington Wizards2007\u20132008Milwaukee Bucks2009Portland Trail Blazers2010\u20132011Obradoiro CAB\nCareer highlights and awards\nFirst-team All-WAC (1998)\n\nCareer   statisticsPoints716 (1.7 ppg)Rebounds1,632 (3.9 rpg)\nStats\u00a0 at NBA.comStats\u00a0 at Basketball-Reference.com\nMedals\n\n\n\nMen's Basketball\n\n\nRepresenting \u00a0United States\n\n\nSummer Universiade\n\n\n\n 1997 Trapani \nNational team\n\n\nMichael David Ruffin (born (1977-01-21)January 21, 1977) is an American former professional basketball player.
