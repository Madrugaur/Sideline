{"name": "Alison Marr", "content": "Alison M. Marr (born 1980)[1] is an American mathematician and mathematics educator. Her research concerns graph theory and graph labeling, and she is also an advocate of inquiry-based learning in mathematics. She works as a professor of mathematics and computer science at Southwestern University in Texas.[2]\n Marr graduated from Murray State University in 2002, and earned a master's degree in mathematics at Texas A&M University in 2004.[3] She completed her Ph.D. in 2007 at Southern Illinois University; her dissertation, Labelings of Directed Graphs, was supervised by Walter D. Wallis.[3][4]\n She has been a member of the mathematics faculty at Southwestern University since 2007.[3] She was department chair for 2015\u20132018.
