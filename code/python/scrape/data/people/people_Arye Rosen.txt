{"name": "Arye Rosen", "content": "Arye Rosen is Academy Professor of Biomedical and Electrical Engineering in the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA[1] and associate vice president at Rowan University and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.\n Rosen got his B.S. degree Electrical Engineering from  Howard University and his M.S. degree in Engineering from Johns Hopkins University. Later, he was awarded his M.Sc. in Physiology from Thomas Jefferson University and his Ph.D. Electrical Engineering from Drexel University.\n Rosen's career spent over thirty-six years with the RCA/David Sarnoff Research Center, where he was awarded the rank of Distinguished Member of Technical Staff. His work there centered on the research and development of microwave devices and circuits, microwave optical interaction and high-power semiconductor lasers.[2] For the past forty-five years he has also been engaged in medical research into the use of laser,[3] acoustic and microwave[4] energies for therapeutic medical devices.\n Dr. Rosen has worked in the Division of Cardiology at Jefferson Medical College since 1969 where he also holds the title of Associate in Medicine and he holds over 60 U.S. patents in the fields of engineering and medicine.\n Dr. Arye Rosen has one son, Dr. Harel D. Rosen, a neonatologist[5][6] and a graduate of Jefferson Medical College, whom he has collaborated with in the founding of the Medical Technology Center for Infants and Children at St. Peter's University Hospital.[7] They also collaborated on engineering a solar-powered blanket used to treat jaundice in developing nations.[8]\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "American electrical engineers", "Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering", "Fellow Members of the IEEE", "American biomedical engineers", "Whiting School of Engineering alumni", "Thomas Jefferson University", "Saint Peter's University", "American people of Jewish descent", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "AC with 0 elements", "Year of birth missing (living people)"], "raw": "Arye RosenBornArye RosenNationalityAmericanEducationB.S.
