While doing this, she also completed a Ph.D. in mathematics education at New York University in 1993.[3] Her dissertation, The Development of the Mathematical Concept of Randomness: Educational Implications, was supervised by Kenneth P. Goldberg.[4]\n She joined New Jersey City University as an assistant professor of mathematics in 1993, adding a concurrent appointment in education in 1999. She has since become a full professor, and served two terms as president of the University Senate.[3]\n Bennett is the coauthor of the textbook Algebra for All (with Phillip Aikey and Julio Guillen, McGraw-Hill, 1997).[3] She is also the author of two popular mathematics books, Randomness (Harvard University Press, 1998),[5] and Logic Made Easy: How to Know When Language Deceives You (W. W.
