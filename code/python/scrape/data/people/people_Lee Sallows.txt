{"name": "Lee Sallows", "content": "Lee Cecil Fletcher Sallows (born April 30, 1944) is a British electronics engineer known for his contributions to recreational mathematics.  He is particularly noted as the inventor of golygons, self-enumerating sentences, and geomagic squares.\n Sallows is an expert on the theory of magic squares[1] and has invented several variations on them, including alphamagic squares[2][3] and geomagic squares.[4] The latter invention caught the attention of mathematician Peter Cameron who has said that he believes that \"an even deeper structure may lie hidden beyond geomagic squares\"[5]\n In \"The lost theorem\" published in 1997 he showed that every 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 magic square is associated with a unique parallelogram on the complex plane, a discovery that had escaped all previous researchers from ancient times down to the present day.[6]  In 2014 Sallows discovered a previously unnoticed result involving the\nmedians of a triangle.[7]\n A golygon is a polygon containing only right angles, such that adjacent sides exhibit consecutive integer lengths. Golygons were invented and named by Sallows[8] and introduced by A.K. Dewdney in the Computer Recreations column of the July 1990 issue of Scientific American.[9]\n In 2012 Sallows invented and named self-tiling tile sets\u2014a new generalization of rep-tiles.[10]\n Lee Sallows is the only son of Florence Eliza Fletcher and Leonard Gandy Sallows.

Sallows attended Dame Alice Owen's School, then located at The Angel, Islington, but failed to settle in and was without diplomas when he left at age 17.
