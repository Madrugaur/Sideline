{"name": "Taiichi Ohno", "content": "Ohno Taiichi (\u5927\u91ce\u8010\u4e00, \u014cno Taiichi, February 29, 1912 \u2013 May 28, 1990) was a Japanese industrial engineer and businessman. He is considered to be the father of the Toyota Production System, which inspired Lean Manufacturing in the U.S.[1][2] He devised the seven wastes (or muda in Japanese) as part of this system. He wrote several books about the system, including Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production.\n Born in 1912 in Dalian, China, and a graduate of the Nagoya Technical High School (Japan), he joined the Toyoda family's Toyoda Spinning upon graduation in 1932 during the Great Depression thanks to the relations of his father to Kiichiro Toyoda, the son of Toyota's founding father Sakichi Toyoda.[3] He moved to the Toyota motor company in 1943 where he worked as a shop-floor supervisor in the engine manufacturing shop of the plant, and gradually rose through the ranks to become an executive. In what is considered to be a slight, possibly because he spoke publicly about the production system, he was denied the normal executive track and was sent instead to consult with suppliers in his later career.[citation needed]\n Ohno's principles influenced areas outside of manufacturing, and have been extended into the service arena.  For example, the field of sales process engineering has shown how the concept of Just In Time (JIT) can improve sales, marketing, and customer service processes.[4][5]\n Ohno was also instrumental in developing the way organisations identify waste, with his \"Seven Wastes\" model which have become core in many academic approaches.[6]  These wastes are:\n 1. Delay, waiting or time spent in a queue with no value being added \n2. Producing more than you need \n3. Over processing or undertaking non-value added activity \n4. Transportation \n5. Unnecessary movement or motion  \n6. Inventory \n7. Defects in the Product.\n Ohno is also known for his \"Ten Precepts\" to think and act to win.[7]\n \n This Japanese business\u2013related biographical article is a stub.

First reduce waste.\nFirst say, \"I can do it.\" And try before everything.\nThe workplace is a teacher.  You can find answers only in the workplace.\nDo anything immediately. Starting something right now is the only way to win.\nOnce you start something, persevere with it. Do not give up until you finish it.\nExplain difficult things in an easy-to-understand manner.  Repeat things that are easy to understand.\nWaste is hidden.  Do not hide it.  Make problems visible.\nValueless motions are equal to shortening one's life.\nRe-improve what was improved for further improvement.\nWisdom is given equally to everybody.  The point is whether one can exercise it.\nSee also[edit]\nShigeo Shingo (\u65b0\u90f7 \u91cd\u96c4, Shing\u014d Shigeo)\nJust In Time (JIT)\nLean manufacturing\nPublished works[edit]\nOhno, Taiichi (1988), Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production, Productivity Press, ISBN\u00a00-915299-14-3\nOhno, Taiichi (1988), Workplace Management, Productivity Press, ISBN\u00a00-915299-19-4\nOhno, Taiichi  (2007), Workplace Management.
