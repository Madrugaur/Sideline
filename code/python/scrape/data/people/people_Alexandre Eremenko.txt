His father Emmanuel Berger was a pathophysiologist, professor and head of the Department of pathophysiology at Ternopil National Medical University. His mother Neonila Eremenko was an ophthalmologist. He obtained his master's degree from Lviv University in 1976 and worked in the Institute of Low temperature physics and Engineering in Kharkiv until 1990.
