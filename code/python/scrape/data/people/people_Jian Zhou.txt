{"name": "Jian Zhou", "content": "\n Jian Zhou (Chinese: \u5468\u5065; pinyin: Zh\u014du Ji\u00e0n; 1957 \u2013 March 1999) was a Chinese virologist and cancer researcher, who with fellow researcher Ian Frazer, invented Gardasil and Cervarix, the vaccines for stimulating human immunological resistance to the cervical cancer-inducing human papilloma virus.[1]\n Zhou was born in 1957 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. He was admitted to Wenzhou Medical College in 1977 and graduated 1982. His wife Xiao-Yi Sun (\u5b59\u5c0f\u4f9d) was his classmate at the college. He subsequently earned a master's degree from Zhejiang Medical University, where he pursued his research interest in HPV.[2] He then earned his M.D. at Henan Medical University (now medical school of Zhengzhou University) and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Beijing Medical University, before moving to the University of Cambridge in 1988 to continue his research in cancer and virus.[3]\n Zhou met future research partner Ian Frazer at the University of Cambridge in 1989, bonded by a mutual respect and willingness to push the limits of their research. The two considered the problem of developing a vaccine for HPV \u2013 a virus that cannot be cultured without living tissue.[4]\n Frazer convinced Zhou to join him at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, and in 1990 they began to use molecular biology to synthesize particles in vitro that could mimic the virus. In March 1991 Zhou's wife and fellow researcher, Xiao-Yi Sun, assembled by Zhou's instructions[5] two proteins into a virus-like particle (VLP),[6] resembling the HPV shell, from which HPV vaccine would ultimately be made.\n The vaccine completely protects unexposed women against four HPV strains responsible for 70% of cervical cancers,[7][8] which kill about 250,000 women annually.[9][10]\n Frazer and Zhou filed a provisional patent in June 1991 and began work on developing the vaccine within UQ. To finance clinical trials, Australian medical company CSL, and later Merck, were sold partial patents.[11] (CSL has the exclusive license to sell Gardasil in New Zealand and Australia, Merck the license elsewhere.)[12] GlaxoSmithKline independently used the same VLP-approach to develop Cervarix, under a later US patent, licensing Frazer's intellectual property in 2005.[13]\n In March 1999, Zhou died of hepatitis, a disease he had contracted as a young man in China. He was survived by his wife Xiao-Yi Sun and son Andreas Zhou.[14]\n In 2008, Zhou's contribution to his efforts in research, including his work with the Gardasil vaccine, were formally recognised with a commemorative service attended by over 300 people, and included a written tribute from the Australian Prime Minister of the time, Kevin Rudd in Brisbane, Australia.[14]\n [15]\n ", "tags": ["1957 births", "1999 deaths", "Biologists from Zhejiang", "Chinese immunologists", "Papillomavirus", "20th-century Chinese physicians", "20th-century Chinese scientists", "Wenzhou Medical College alumni", "Zhejiang University alumni", "Zhengzhou University alumni", "Academics of the University of Cambridge", "University of Queensland faculty", "Chinese expatriates in Australia", "Deaths from hepatitis", "Physicians from Zhejiang", "Chinese virologists", "Cancer researchers", "Use Australian English from June 2020", "All Wikipedia articles written in Australian English", "Use dmy dates from June 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Chinese-language text", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThe native form of this personal name is  Zhou Jian.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nJian ZhouBorn1957\u00a0(1957)Hangzhou, Zhejiang, ChinaDiedMarch 1957 (aged\u00a0-43\u2013-42)Hangzhou, ChinaNationalityChineseAlma\u00a0materUniversity of QueenslandUniversity of CambridgeScientific careerFieldsVirologyImmunologyInstitutionsWenzhou Medical CollegeZhejiang UniversityZhengzhou University\n\nJian Zhou (Chinese: \u5468\u5065; pinyin: Zh\u014du Ji\u00e0n; 1957 \u2013 March 1999) was a Chinese virologist and cancer researcher, who with fellow researcher Ian Frazer, invented Gardasil and Cervarix, the vaccines for stimulating human immunological resistance to the cervical cancer-inducing human papilloma virus.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 HPV and Papilloma vaccine\n3 Death\n4 Published papers\n5 References and notes\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nZhou was born in 1957 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.

Previous reports showed a remarkable 100% efficacy of a quadrivalent vaccine targeting HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 on outcomes related to vaccine HPV types in women with no evidence of previous exposure to those types [...] subgroups of subjects with no evidence of previous exposure to relevant vaccine HPV types were evaluated separately for vaccine efficacy. In these subgroups, efficacy of nearly 100% against all grades of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma in situ related to vaccine HPV types was reported [...] Why is vaccine efficacy modest in the entire cohort? One factor is the apparent lack of efficacy among subjects with evidence of previous exposure to HPV types included in the vaccine.

Ian Frazer\u2019s break-through vaccine is 100 per cent effective against the most common form of the virus that causes cervical cancer, according to final-stage trial results [...] a delighted Professor Frazer, 52, said last night: 'It is very rare, almost unheard of, to achieve a 100 per cent efficacy rate in any treatment, so these results are truly wonderful.'\n\n\n^ \nEstimates of the contemporary global mortality rate have remained in the 190,000 to 300,000 range from 2000 to 2010. The 2007 WHO progress report says that preventable cervical cancer \"was responsible in 2005 for up to 500,000 new cases, and up to 257,000 deaths, more than 90% in low- and middle-income countries\", but, \"According to WHO\u2019s projections, deaths from cervical cancer will rise to 320,000 in 2015 and to 435,000 in 2030\" (p.4). These projections may be little effected by vaccination programs (anyway unlikely on cost grounds) because \"A reduction in cancer incidence and mortality might not be measurable before 10 to 30 years after the vaccine is introduced.\" (p.5). Other estimates of the problem's scale are broadly in agreement:\n\nKennedy, F. (25 January 2006). \"UQ Australian of the Year Will Continue Fight for Women's Health\". UQ News. Professor Frazer said Australia and other developed nations had effective Pap smear programs to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. 'Despite this, cervical cancer continues to be a shocking disease for women in the developed world. Women living in poverty in the developing world, where Pap smears are not widely available, account for most of the 250,000 deaths from cervical cancer each year. So this vaccine has the potential to do most good in the developing world, where it could help lift women out of poverty by relieving the burden of disease\n\"Transcripts \u2013 Professor Ian Frazer\".

GlaxoSmithKline's] estimate of the prevalence of cervical cancer in USA roughly matches the National Cancer Institute's statistics. But according to the World Health Organization, the disease is far more common in developing countries, which account for 80 percent of the annual cases worldwide and about 190,000 deaths a year (compared to about 4,000 deaths in USA).\n\n\n^ Chen, Huanhuan; Wang, Danhong (22 October 2007). \"An interview with Jian Zhou's wife, Dr. Xiaoyi Sun\".
