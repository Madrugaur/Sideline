He was the father of Borys Paton.\n Born in 1870 in Nice, France, he studied at the Dresden Technical University (graduated in 1894), and at the Petersburg Institute of Railway Roads (graduated in 1896). He designed the structure of the train station in Dresden, and was a lecturer at the  Moscow Engineering College of Railway Roads (1889\u20131904). Paton was a Professor at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute and the Chairman of the Bridge Department from 1904 to 1938. In 1929 he organized a welding laboratory and the Electric Welding Committee.
