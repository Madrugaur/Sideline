{"name": "Albert Kahn (architect)", "content": "Albert Kahn (March 21, 1869 \u2013 December 8, 1942) was the foremost American industrial architect of his day. He is sometimes called the \"architect of Detroit\", designing such major industrial works as the Ford River Rouge Complex, the largest in the world when built; as well as skyscrapers and office buildings in the city, and mansions in the suburbs. He built a practice with hundreds of architects; in 1937 his firm designed 19 percent of all architect-designed factories in the U.S.\n In addition, under a unique contract in 1929, Kahn established a design and training office in Moscow, sending twenty-five staff there to train Soviet architects and engineers, and to design hundreds of industrial buildings under their first five-year plan. He was the only consulting architect on Soviet industrial construction. In 1943, the Franklin Institute posthumously awarded Kahn the Frank P. Brown Medal.[1]\n Many of Albert Kahn's personal working papers and construction photographs are housed at the University of Michigan's Bentley Historical Library.[2] His personal working library, the Albert Kahn Library Collection, is housed at Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, Michigan.[3] The Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian house most of the family's correspondence and other materials.[4]\n Kahn was born on March 21, 1869, to a Jewish family[5] in Rhaunen, Kingdom of Prussia. Kahn immigrated as a child with his family to Detroit, Michigan in 1880, when he was 11.[6] His father Joseph was trained as a rabbi; his mother Rosalie had a talent for the visual arts and music.[6] Kahn had four brothers, including  Moritz, who became an engineer; and Julius Kahn, an engineer and inventor, who later collaborated with him in his architectural firm. They also had two sisters.\n Kahn quickly learned English and went to public school. As a teenager, he got a job at the architectural firm of Mason and Rice.[6] In 1891 at age 22, he won a Rotch Traveling Fellowship, to study abroad in Europe, where he toured Germany, France, Italy, and Belgium with Henry Bacon, another young architecture student. Bacon later designed the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C..[6][7]\n In 1895, Kahn founded the architectural firm Albert Kahn Associates.[8] Together with his younger brother Julius, he developed a new style of construction whereby reinforced concrete replaced wood in factory walls, roofs, and supports. Julius also developed numerous improvements to reinforced concrete. This material gave better fire protection and allowed large volumes of unobstructed interior. Packard Motor Car Company's factory, which Kahn designed in 1903, was the first to be built according to this principle.[9]\n The success of the Packard plant attracted the interest of automobile industrialist Henry Ford in Kahn's designs. Kahn designed Ford Motor Company's Highland Park plant, begun in 1909, where Ford consolidated production of the Ford Model T and perfected the assembly line.[10][11]\n In 1917 Kahn designed the massive, half-mile-long Ford River Rouge Complex in Dearborn, Michigan. The Rouge was developed as the largest manufacturing complex in the United States and, in its time, in the world. Its workforce peaked at 120,000 workers.\n Kahn was also responsible for designing many of the buildings and houses built under direction of the Hiram Walker family in Walkerville, Ontario, including Willistead Manor. Kahn's interest in historically styled buildings is also seen in his houses in Detroit's Indian Village, the Cranbrook House, the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House, and The Dearborn Inn, the world's first airport hotel.\n Kahn designed the 28-story Art Deco Fisher Building in Detroit, now a designated landmark and considered one of the most beautiful elements of the Detroit skyline. In 1928, the Fisher building was honored by the Architectural League of New York as the year's most beautiful commercial structure. Between 1917 and 1929, Kahn designed the headquarters for all three major daily newspapers in Detroit. His work was also part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics.[12]\n On May 8, 1929, through an agreement signed with Kahn by Saul G. Bron, President of Amtorg, the Soviet government contracted Albert Kahn Associates to design the Stalingrad Tractor Plant, the first tractor plant in the USSR. On January 9, 1930, a second contract with Kahn was signed for his firm to become consulting architects for all industrial construction in the Soviet Union.[13]\n Under these contracts, during 1929\u20131932 and the Great Depression, Kahn's firm established a design and training bureau in Moscow to train and supervise Soviet architects and engineers. This bureau, under the government's Gosproektstroi, was headed by one of Albert Kahn's brothers, Moritz Kahn, and 25 other Kahn Associates staff, who worked in Moscow during this project. They trained more than 4,000 Soviet architects and engineers; and designed 521 plants and factories[6] under the nation's first five-year plan.[13][14]\n Kahn also designed many of what are considered the classic buildings at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. These include the Burton Memorial Tower, Hill Auditorium, Hatcher Graduate Library, and William L. Clements Library. Kahn said later in life that of all the buildings he designed, he wanted most to be remembered for his work on the William L. Clements Library.\n Kahn frequently collaborated with architectural sculptor Corrado Parducci. In all, Parducci worked on about 50 Kahn commissions, including banks, office buildings, newspaper buildings, mausoleums, hospitals, and private residences.\n Kahn's firm was able to adapt to the changing needs of World War I and designed numerous army airfield and naval bases for the United States government during the war. By World War II, Kahn's 600-person office was involved in making Detroit industry part of America's Arsenal of Democracy. Among others, the office designed the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant, and the Willow Run Bomber Plant, Kahn's last building, located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The Ford Motor Company mass-produced Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers here.[15][16]\n In 1937, Albert Kahn Associates was responsible for 19 percent of all architect-designed factories in the U.S.[6] In 1941, Kahn received the eighth-highest salary and compensation package in the U.S., $486,936, of which he paid 72% in tax.[17]\n Albert Kahn worked on more than 1,000 commissions from Henry Ford[6] and hundreds for other automakers. Kahn designed showrooms for Ford Motor Company in several cities, including New York, Washington, D.C., and Boston. He died in Detroit on December 8, 1942.\n As of 2006, approximately 60 Kahn buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Not all of Kahn's works have been preserved. Cass Technical High School in Detroit, designed by Malcomson and Higginbotham and built by Albert Kahn's firm in 1922, was demolished in 2011 after vandals had stripped it of most of its fixtures.[18] The Donovan Building, later occupied by Motown Records, was abandoned for decades and deteriorated. The city demolished it as part of its beautification plan before the 2006 Super Bowl XL.\n Fifteen Albert Kahn buildings are recognized by official Michigan historical markers:[19]\n He is not related to American architect Louis Kahn of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n All buildings are located in Detroit, unless otherwise indicated.\n Campus structures built during his career (source of this list: Schreiber, Penny. \"Albert Kahn's Campus.\" The Ann Arbor Observer, January, 2002, pp.\u00a027\u201333):\n Greek Organization Buildings:\n ", "tags": ["American Neoclassical architects", "Art Deco architects", "Historicist architects", "1869 births", "1942 deaths", "Concrete pioneers", "Architects from Detroit", "Artists from Detroit", "Culture of Detroit", "19th-century German architects", "Jewish architects", "Jewish inventors", "American people of German-Jewish descent", "German Jews", "German emigrants to the United States", "People from Birkenfeld (district)", "People from the Rhine Province", "20th-century American architects", "Olympic competitors in art competitions", "20th-century German architects", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American architect\nFor other people named Albert Kahn, see Albert Kahn (disambiguation).\nFor architect with similar name (but no relation), see Louis Kahn.\nAlbert KahnBorn(1869-03-21)March 21, 1869Rhaunen, Kingdom of Prussia (Germany)DiedDecember 8, 1942(1942-12-08) (aged\u00a073)Detroit, Michigan, USNationalityAmericanOccupationarchitectRelativesJulius Kahn, brotherAlbert E.
