{"name": "Alfred Foster (mathematician)", "content": "Alfred Leon Foster (known as Alfred Foster) was an American mathematician.[1] He was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley from 1934 until 1971.[2] In 1932 he was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in Z\u00fcrich.\n In 1934 he accepted a regular position at Berkeley. At that time Griffith Evans was Head of the Mathematics Department and was charged by President Sproul with building a first-class mathematics center, which he did. Alfred Foster and Charles Morrey (who became the first department chairman after Evans' retirement) were Evans' first two appointments.

Starting from this point, he soon focused his interest on the related theory of Boolean algebras and Boolean rings, and was thus led from logic to algebra.
