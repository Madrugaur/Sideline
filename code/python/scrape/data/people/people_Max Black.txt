{"name": "Max Black", "content": "Max Black (24 February 1909 \u2013 27 August 1988) was a British-American philosopher, who was a leading figure in analytic philosophy in the years after World War II. He made contributions to the philosophy of language, the philosophy of mathematics and science, and the philosophy of art, also publishing studies of the work of philosophers such as Frege. His translation (with Peter Geach) of Frege's published philosophical writing is a classic text.\n Born in Baku, present-day Azerbaijan, of Jewish descent,[2] Black grew up in London, where his family had moved in 1912. He studied mathematics at Queens' College, Cambridge where he developed an interest in the philosophy of mathematics. Russell, Wittgenstein, G. E. Moore, and Ramsey were all at Cambridge at that time, and their influence on Black may have been considerable. He graduated in 1930 and was awarded a fellowship to study at G\u00f6ttingen for a year.\n From 1931\u201336, he was mathematics master at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle.\n His first book was The Nature of Mathematics (1933), an exposition of Principia Mathematica and of current developments in the philosophy of mathematics.\n Black had made notable contributions to the metaphysics of identity. In his \"The Identity of Indiscernibles\", Black presents an objection to Leibniz' Law by means of a hypothetical scenario in which he conceives two distinct spheres having exactly the same properties, thereby contradicting Leibniz' second principle in his formulation of \"The Identity of Indiscernibles\". By virtue of there being two objects, albeit with identical properties, the existence of two objects, even in a void, denies their identicality.\n He lectured in mathematics at the Institute of Education in London from 1936 to 1940. In 1940 he moved to the United States and joined the Philosophy Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign. In 1946 he accepted a professorship in philosophy at Cornell University. In 1948, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Black advised the philosophy dissertation of American novelist William H. Gass. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963.[3] Black died in Ithaca, New York age 79. His younger brother was the architect Sir Misha Black.\n ", "tags": ["1909 births", "1988 deaths", "Academics of the UCL Institute of Education", "Alumni of Queens' College, Cambridge", "Analytic philosophers", "Emigrants from the Russian Empire to the United Kingdom", "British emigrants to the United States", "British Jews", "Naturalized citizens of the United States", "Cornell University faculty", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Jewish philosophers", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign faculty", "Philosophers of language", "Philosophers of science", "Metaphor theorists", "Articles lacking in-text citations from July 2011", "All articles lacking in-text citations", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For other people named Max Black, see Max Black (disambiguation).\nThis article includes a list of general references, but it remains largely unverified because it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations.
