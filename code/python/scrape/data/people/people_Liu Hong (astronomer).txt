{"name": "Liu Hong (astronomer)", "content": "Liu Hong (129\u2013210), courtesy name Yuanzhuo, was a Chinese official, astronomer and mathematician who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He developed a work on predicting the passage of the moon which was in use during the Three Kingdoms period of China.\n Liu Hong was from Mengyin County (\u8499\u9670\u7e23), Taishan Commandery, which is present-day Mengyin County, Shandong, and was a descendant of Liu Yu, the Prince of Lu, a son of Emperor Jing (r.\u00a0 157\u2013141 BCE). He developed an interest in astronomy at an early age. He was made an officer at the Imperial Astronomy around 160 CE which led to him writing the lost works Qi Yao Shu (\u4e03\u66dc\u8853; The Art of the Seven Planets) and Ba Yuan Shu (\u516b\u5143\u8853; The Art of Eight Elements).[1]\n After the death of his father, Liu Hong retired for a short time but returned to his work, collaborating with Cai Yong on the Qian Xiang Li (\u4e7e\u8c61\u66c6; Qian Xiang Calendar),[2] this was considered so advanced for its time that it was adopted by the Han government immediately. The calendar predicted the movement of the moon, the first time such considerations had been made in ancient China.[1] This system marked the first appearance of the argument of periapsis, a means to calculate syzygy (the calculation between three celestial bodies), and a means of charting the moon through the seasons.[3] His means of establishing the accuracy of the calendar was by the detection of eclipses.[4]\n This system replaced one which had been used by the Han dynasty since 85 CE, and following the end of the Han dynasty and beginning of the Three Kingdoms period, it was adopted by the Eastern Wu state (229\u2013280 CE) until China was re-unified under the Jin dynasty in 280 CE.[5] In 179 CE, he was asked by the Imperial Secretariat to consider proposals made by a private scholar called Wang Han regarding lunar calendars, but did not support those proposals.
