He wrote, \"If zero is added to any number, the sum is the same number; if zero is subtracted from any number, the number remains unchanged; if zero is multiplied by any number, the product is zero\".\nIn the case of dividing a fraction he has found out the method of multiplying the fraction by the reciprocal of the divisor.\nHe wrote on the practical applications of algebra\nHe separated algebra from arithmetic\nHe was the first person to give a formula for solving quadratic equations.\n\n\n\n\nx\n=\n\n\n\n\u2212\nb\n\u00b1\n\n\n\nb\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n4\na\nc\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2\na\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x={\\frac {-b\\pm {\\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac\\ }}}{2a}}.}\n\n\nBibliography[edit]\nO'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., \"Sridhara\", MacTutor History of Mathematics archive, University of St Andrews.\nThe Date of Sridharacharya by S.
