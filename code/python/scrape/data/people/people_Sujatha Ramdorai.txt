{"name": "Sujatha Ramdorai", "content": "\n Sujatha Ramdorai (born 1962)[1] is an algebraic number theorist known for her work on Iwasawa theory.  She is a professor of mathematics and Canada Research Chair at University of British Columbia, Canada.[2][3] She was previously a professor at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.\n She completed her B.Sc in 1982 at St. Joseph's college, Bangalore and then got her M.Sc. through correspondence from Annamalai University in 1985. After that she went for PhD at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and was awarded her PhD under supervision of Raman Parimala in 1992.[4] Her dissertation was \"Witt Groups of Real Surfaces and Real Geometry\".\n Dr. Ramdorai initially worked in the areas of algebraic theory of quadratic forms and arithmetic geometry of elliptic curves.[5] Together with Coates, Fukaya, Kato, and Venjakob she formulated a non-commutative version of the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory, on which much foundation of this important subject is based.[6] Iwasawa theory has its origins in the work of a great Japanese mathematician, Kenkichi Iwasawa.[7]\n She holds an adjunct professorship position at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune.[8]\n Working with her husband Srinivasan Ramdorai and Indian mathematics writer V.S. Sastry, Sujatha Ramdorai conceived of and partially funded the Ramanujan Math Park in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh, which was inaugurated at the end of 2017.  The park is dedicated to mathematics education and honors the great Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920).\n She is a member of the Scientific Committee of several international research agencies such as the Indo-French Centre for Promotion of Advanced Research, Banff International Research Station, International Centre for Pure and Applied Mathematics. She was a member of the National Knowledge Commission from 2007 to 2009. She is at present a member of the Prime Minister's Scientific Advisory Council from 2009 onwards and also a member of the National Innovation Council.[9] She is also on the advisory board of Gonit Sora.[10]\n Ramdorai became the first Indian to win the prestigious ICTP Ramanujan Prize in 2006. She was also awarded the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award, the highest honour in scientific fields by the Indian Government in 2004.[11] She is also the recipient of the 2020 Krieger\u2013Nelson Prize for her exceptional contributions to mathematics research.[12]\n ", "tags": ["Indian women mathematicians", "Living people", "1962 births", "Recipients of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in Mathematical Science", "Tata Institute of Fundamental Research alumni", "University of British Columbia faculty", "Indian editors", "Indian number theorists", "20th-century Indian mathematicians", "20th-century Indian women scientists", "20th-century Indian scientists", "21st-century Indian women scientists", "21st-century Indian scientists", "21st-century Indian mathematicians", "Scientists from Bangalore", "Indian women editors", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "20th-century women writers", "21st-century women writers", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from August 2015", "Use Indian English from August 2015", "All Wikipedia articles written in Indian English", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Indian mathematician\n\n\nSujatha RamdoraiSujatha RamdoraiBorn1962\u00a0(1962)NationalityIndianCitizenshipIndianAlma\u00a0materSt. Joseph's College, BangaloreAnnamalai University  TIFRKnown\u00a0fornon-commutative Iwasawa theory, Arithmetic of Algebraic varietiesAwardsICTP Ramanujan Prize (2006)  Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award (2004) Alexander von Humboldt Fellow (1997\u20131998)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsTIFR  University of British ColumbiaDoctoral advisorRaman Parimala\n\nSujatha Ramdorai (born 1962)[1] is an algebraic number theorist known for her work on Iwasawa theory.
