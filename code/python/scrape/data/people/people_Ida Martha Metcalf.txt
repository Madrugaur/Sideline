By 1870, she was living in Massachusetts, where she taught school for many years.\n In 1883, Ida began studying at Boston University where she received a Bachelor\u2019s in Philosophy (Ph.B.) in 1886. From 1888 to 1889, she was a graduate student at Cornell University, earning a master's degree in mathematics. After teaching at Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, she returned to Cornell and receive her Ph.D. in 1893.\n For many years after receiving her Ph.D., Ida taught high school and worked in several financial firms and as a Civil Service Examiner. In 1912, she became a statistician in the Department of Finance for New York City, where she remained until her retirement in 1921.\n After retirement, Ida continued to work intermittently as a Civil Service Examiner until 1939.
