{"name": "Gae Aulenti", "content": "Gae Aulenti (pronounced\u00a0[\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0e au\u02c8l\u025bnti]; 4 December 1927\u00a0\u2013 31 October 2012) was a prolific Italian architect, whose work spans industrial and exhibition design, furniture, graphics, stage design, lighting and interior design.[1] She was well known for several large-scale museum projects, including the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris (1980\u201386) with ACT Architecture, the Contemporary Art Gallery at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the restoration of Palazzo Grassi in Venice (1985\u201386), and the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco with HOK (firm) (2000\u20132003). Aulenti was one of the few women designing in the postwar period in Italy, where Italian designers sought to make meaningful connections to production principles beyond Italy.[2] This avant-garde design movement blossomed into an entirely new type of Italian architecture, one full of imaginary utopias leaving standardization to the past.\n Aulenti's deep involvement in the Milan design scene of the 1950s and 1960s formed her into an architect respected for her analytical abilities to navigate metropolitan complexity no matter the medium. Her conceptual development can be followed in the design magazine Casabella, to which she contributed regularly.[2]\n Her contemporaries were Vittorio Gregotti, Giancarlo de Carlo and Aldo Rossi.\n A native of Palazzolo dello Stella (Friuli), Gaetana Aulenti (Gae, as she was known, is pronounced similarly to \"guy\")[3] studied to be an architect at the Milan School of Architecture of the Polytechnic University, and graduated in 1954 as one of two women in a class of 20.[4] She grew up playing the piano and reading books. She told The Times that she studied architecture in defiance of her parents\u2019 hope that she would become \u201ca nice society girl.\u201d She soon joined the staff of Casabella, a design magazine, and joined with her peers in rejecting the architecture of masters like Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius. They called themselves the \u201cNeo Liberty\u201d movement, where they favored traditional building methods coupled with individual stylistic expression.\n Aulenti began her career as a private-practicing architect and freelance designer out of Milan in 1954.[5] Her architectural practice included many interior flat designs for corporate clients, including Fiat, Banca Commerciale Italiana, Pirelli, Olivetti, and Knoll International. Her freelance design work included products for Poltronova, Candle, Ideal Standard, Louis Vuitton, and Artemide, to name a few.[5]\n Branching into written publication, Aulenti joined the editorial staff at the design magazine Casabella-Continuit\u00e0 from 1955 until 1965 as an art director, doing graphic design work, and later served on the board of directors for the renamed Lotus International magazine (based in Milan from 1974 onwards). During that time she became part of a group of young professionals influenced by the philosophy of Ernesto Nathan Rogers.\n Aulenti taught at Venice School of Architecture as an assistant instructor in architectural composition[5] from 1960 to 1962 and at the Milan School of Architecture of the Polytechnic University from 1964 to 1967. With these experiences, she became a visiting lecturer at congresses and professional institutions in Europe and North America from 1967 onwards. She sought membership in two of them, American Society of Interior Designers, 1967, and Member of Movimento Studi per I'Architettura, Milan, 1955-61.[5] During that time, she also designed for a department store, La Rinascente, and later designed furniture for Zanotta, where she created two of her most well known pieces, the \"April\" folding chair which was made from stainless steel with a removable cover, and her \"Sanmarco\" table constructed from plate-glass. Transitioning from teaching, Aulenti joined Luca Ronconi as a collaborator in figurative research for Laboratorio di Progettazione Teatrale out of Prato, Florence (1976\u201379).[5] She then also served as vice-president of the Italian Association Of Industrial Design (ADI).\n In 1981, she was chosen to turn the 1900 Beaux Arts Gare d'Orsay train station, a spectacular landmark originally designed by Victor Laloux, into the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, a museum of mainly French art from 1848 to 1915. Her work on the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay led to commissions to create a space for the National Museum of Modern Art at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris; the restoration of the Palazzo Grassi as an art museum in Venice; the conversion of an old Italian embassy in Berlin into an Academy of Science; and the restoration of a 1929 exhibition hall in Barcelona as Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. In San Francisco, she transformed the city\u2019s Beaux Art Main Library into a museum of Asian art.[3] In 2011, Aulenti oversaw the expansion of Perugia Airport.\n Aulenti also occasionally worked as a stage designer for Luca Ronconi, including for Samstag aus Licht (1984). She also planned six stores for the fashion designer Adrienne Vittadini, including one on Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles. She even designed the mannequins.[3]\n Aulenti's work in theater was highly architectural, as she saw 'the scenic box not as a container to embellish and render recognizable in the sense of something already known, but as a real space in itself\".[6]\n Her career ended with over 200 built works.[7]\n Aulenti worked in the post-war period of Italy while creating pieces that spanned across a wide variety of styles and influences. She always wanted the focus of the room to be the occupants, believing people make the room a room. She had a modest style; Vogue quoted her as saying \"advice to whoever asks me how to make a home is to not have anything, just a few shelves for books, some pillows to sit on. And then, to take a stand against the ephemeral, against passing trends...and to return to lasting values.\"\n Aulenti died in Milan on 31 October 2012, just weeks prior to her 85th birthday. She was suffering from chronic illness and made her last public appearance on 16 October, when she received the career prize at the Milan Triennale. Aulenti is commemorated in Milan by the Piazza Gae Aulenti in December 2012, soon after her death. \n A portion of Aulenti's papers, drawings, and designs including the design drawings for the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, California are collected at International Archive of Women in Architecture in Newman Library, Virginia Tech.[10]\n ", "tags": ["1927 births", "2012 deaths", "People from Palazzolo dello Stella", "20th-century Italian architects", "Italian interior designers", "Italian women architects", "Recipients of the Praemium Imperiale", "CS1 Italian-language sources (it)", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Gae AulentiGae Aulenti in 1986BornGaetana Aulenti(1927-12-04)December 4, 1927Palazzolo dello Stella, ItalyDiedOctober 31, 2012(2012-10-31) (aged\u00a084)Milan, ItalyNationalityItalianEducationMilan School of Architecture of the Polytechnic UniversityKnown\u00a0fortransforming historic public buildings into world renown museum spacesNotable work\nMus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris, France\nMus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne at the Centre Pompidou, Paris, France\nPalazzo Grassi, Venice, Italy\nMuseu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain\nAsian Art Museum, San Francisco, USA\n\n The main gallery of Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay\nGae Aulenti (pronounced\u00a0[\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0e au\u02c8l\u025bnti]; 4 December 1927\u00a0\u2013 31 October 2012) was a prolific Italian architect, whose work spans industrial and exhibition design, furniture, graphics, stage design, lighting and interior design.[1] She was well known for several large-scale museum projects, including the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris (1980\u201386) with ACT Architecture, the Contemporary Art Gallery at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the restoration of Palazzo Grassi in Venice (1985\u201386), and the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco with HOK (firm) (2000\u20132003).

Women in architecture must not think of themselves as a minority, because the minute you do, you become paralyzed. It is important to never create the problem.\" - Aulenti quoted in The Guardian's recent obituary.\n\"Advice to whoever asks me how to make a home is to not have anything, just a few shelves for books, some pillows to sit on. And then, to take a stand against the ephemeral, against passing trends...and to return to lasting values.\" - Aulenti to Vogue\n\"I am convinced that architecture is tied to the polis, it is an art of the city, of the foundation, and as such it is necessarily related and conditioned by the context in which it is born. Place, time, and culture create that architecture, instead of another.\" - Aulenti in Margherita Petranzan, Gae Aulenti, Rizzoli Skira, Milan, 2002\n\"It's not possible to define a style in my work. If you're designing an airport, then airplanes are important. It's no more complicated designing a museum. I prefer museums for my personal passion - the art.\" - Aulenti quoted in The Times\n\"The conscious principle in this design has been to achieve forms that could create experiences, and that could at the same time welcome everyone's experiences with the serenity of an effortless development.\" - Aulenti\n\"When you're criticized for something, it's best to wait two or three years and see.\" - Aulenti\n\"What is more real and tangible within an artificial space than brick?\" - Aulenti\n\"Raggi: Has the fact that you are a woman been a crucial influence in your work:\" Aulenti: Yes.\"  - Aulenti in interview with Franco Raggi, \"From a Great Desire to Build a City\" published in Modo, no. 21, 1979.\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"architect Gae Aulenti passes away\".
