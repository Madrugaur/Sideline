{"name": "Peng Shige", "content": "Peng Shige (Chinese: \u5f6d\u5b9e\u6208, born December 8, 1947 in Binzhou, Shandong) is a Chinese mathematician noted for his contributions in stochastic analysis and mathematical finance.\n Peng Shige was born in Binzhou and raised in Shandong, while his parents' hometown is Haifeng County in south-eastern Guangdong, he is a grandnephew of the famous revolutionary Peng Pai, and his grandfather (Peng Pai's brother) is also recognized a \"revolutionary martyr\" by the nation.[1][2][3]  He went to a countryside working with farmers as an \"Educated youth\" from 1968 to 1971, and studied in the Department of Physics, Shandong University from 1971 to 1974 and went to work at the Institute of Mathematics, Shandong University in 1978. In 1983 he took an opportunity to enter Paris Dauphine University, France under the supervision of Alain Bensoussan, who was a student of Jacques-Louis Lions. He obtained his PhDs from Paris Dauphine University in 1985[4] and from University of Provence in 1986. Then he returned to China and did postdoctoral research at Fudan University before becoming a professor at Shandong University in 1990. In 1992 he was awarded the Habilitation \u00e0 Diriger des Recherches by the University of Provence. He was promoted to Distinguished Professor of the Ministry of Education of China (Cheung Kong Scholarship Programme) in 1999.[2][3]\n Professor Peng generalized the stochastic maximum principle in stochastic optimal control.  In a paper published in 1990 with \u00c9tienne Pardoux, Peng founded the general theory (including nonlinear expectation) of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), though linear BSDEs had been introduced by Jean-Michel Bismut in 1973.[5]  Soon Feynman\u2013Kac type connections of BSDEs and certain kinds of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), e.g., Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation, were obtained, where the solutions of these PDEs can be interpreted in the classical or viscosity senses. As a particular case the solution of the Black\u2013Scholes equation can be represented as the solution of a simple linear BSDE, which can be regarded as a starting point of the BSDEs' applications in mathematical finance. A type of nonlinear expectation, called the g-expectation, was also derived from the theory of BSDEs. General theories of nonlinear expectations were developed later. These have various applications in utility theory, and the theory of dynamic risk measures.\n Peng was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2005. As one of the invited speakers, he gave a one-hour plenary lecture[6] at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Hyderabad, India on August 24, 2010.[7][8][9][10] He has been appointed as \"Global Scholars\" for academic years 2011\u20132014 by Princeton University, hosted by the university's departments of mathematics, operations research and financial engineering, and the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics, as he \"is a global leader in the field of probability theory and financial mathematics.\" [11][12][13]  In March 2015, as one of six or seven nominees, Peng was nominated for Abel Prize by Norwegian mathematician Bernt \u00d8ksendal.[5] In September 2020, he was awarded Future Science Prize\u00a0[zh] in mathematics and computer science.[14]\n ", "tags": ["1947 births", "Living people", "Educators from Shandong", "Fudan University alumni", "Mathematicians from Shandong", "Members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences", "Paris Dauphine University alumni", "People from Binzhou", "Shandong University alumni", "Shandong University faculty", "University of Provence alumni", "CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh)", "CS1 Norwegian-language sources (no)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 maint: location", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles containing Chinese-language text", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Articles containing simplified Chinese-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "In this Chinese name, the family name is  Peng.\nPeng Shige\u5f6d\u5b9e\u6208Born (1947-12-08) December 8, 1947 (age\u00a073)Binzhou, Shandong, ChinaAlma\u00a0materShandong UniversityParis Dauphine UniversityUniversity of ProvenceFudan UniversityKnown\u00a0forBSDE Mathematical FinanceScientific careerFieldsMathematics\nMathematical FinanceInstitutionsShandong UniversityFudan UniversityChinese Academy of Sciences\nChinese nameTraditional\u00a0Chinese\u5f6d\u5be6\u6208Simplified Chinese\u5f6d\u5b9e\u6208TranscriptionsStandard MandarinHanyu PinyinP\u00e9ng Sh\u00edg\u0113\n\n\nPeng Shige (Chinese: \u5f6d\u5b9e\u6208, born December 8, 1947 in Binzhou, Shandong) is a Chinese mathematician noted for his contributions in stochastic analysis and mathematical finance.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Academic contributions\n3 Honours\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nPeng Shige was born in Binzhou and raised in Shandong, while his parents' hometown is Haifeng County in south-eastern Guangdong, he is a grandnephew of the famous revolutionary Peng Pai, and his grandfather (Peng Pai's brother) is also recognized a \"revolutionary martyr\" by the nation.[1][2][3]  He went to a countryside working with farmers as an \"Educated youth\" from 1968 to 1971, and studied in the Department of Physics, Shandong University from 1971 to 1974 and went to work at the Institute of Mathematics, Shandong University in 1978.
