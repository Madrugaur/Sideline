He is best known for his inventive structures that incorporated a range of atypical building materials to provide shelter in the developing world and emergency contexts. [1]\n Khalili received his philosophical and architectural education in Iran, Turkey, and the United States. \nIn 1970 he was licensed by the State of California and practiced architecture in the U.S. and around the world. Khalili was known for his innovation into the Geltaftan Earth-and-Fire System known as Ceramic Houses and the Earthbag Construction technique called Superadobe. His designs are heavily inspired by traditional arid house designs in his homeland Iran. He was involved with Earth Architecture and Third World Development since 1975, and was a U.N. consultant for Earth Architecture.\n He developed his Super Adobe system in 1984, in response to a NASA call for designs for human settlements on the Moon and Mars. The project had been completely theoretical until the Persian Gulf War when refugees were sent into Iran. When this occurred Khalili partnered with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and applied his research to emergency shelters.\n In 1991 he founded the California Institute of Earth Art and Architecture (Cal-Earth), where he taught his Superadobe building technique.  Although Khalili's work received mixed support in his native country, arguably due to social paradigms and political unrest, he became a prominent American leader on the value of ethically based architecture, where the needs of the homeless are considered above all else.\n In 1984, Khalili received the award for \u201cExcellence in Technology\u201d from the California Council of the American Institute of Architects (CCAIA) for his innovative Ceramic House System.  In 1987 he received a Certificate of Special Recognition from the U.N. International Year of Shelter for the Homeless and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for his project \"Housing for the Homeless: Research and Education.\" In 2004 Khalili won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture for sandbag shelters built with Superadobe.[3]\n Khalili wrote books on his architectural philosophy & techniques as well as translations of poetry from Rumi, the poet he considered instrumental in his design inspiration.\n ", "tags": ["1936 births", "2008 deaths", "Iranian architects", "American people of Iranian descent", "20th-century American architects", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles containing Persian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Iranian-American architect\nNader Khalili (Persian: \u0646\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u062e\u0644\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\u200e; 1936\u20132008) was an Iranian-born architect.
