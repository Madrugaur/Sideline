{"name": "Heini Dittmar", "content": "Heini Dittmar (March 30, 1912, Bad Kissingen, Unterfranken, Germany \u2013 April 28, 1960 near M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr, West Germany) was a record-breaking German glider pilot.\n Inspired by the example of his glider flying brother Edgar, Dittmar took an apprenticeship at the German Institute for Gliding (DFS). In 1932, flying his self-built glider Kondor, he won a first prize at the Rh\u00f6n Glider Competition.\n Dittmar then became a research pilot. In 1934, he, Hanna Reitsch, Peter Riedel, and Wolf Hirth were members of Professor Georgii's South American Glider Expedition,[1]:65 where in Argentina he achieved a new world gliding altitude record (about 4,350 metres (14,270\u00a0ft)).[2] Later the same year, he achieved a new world record for long-distance using a Fafnir II and was awarded the Hindenburg Cup. In 1936, he achieved the first crossing of the Alps in a glider. He then crowned his career as a glider pilot by becoming the first Gliding World Champion after his victory at the first Rh\u00f6n International Gliding Competition in 1937.[3]\n During and after the Second World War, Dittmar worked as an aircraft designer and test pilot. On 2 October 1941, flying the Messerschmitt Me 163A V4 KE+SW, he became the first human to fly faster than 1,000\u00a0km/h (620\u00a0mph).[1]:175 This record was achieved over the FAI-specified 3-km distance and was measured using an Askania theodolite. Later, on 6 July 1944, he reached a speed of 1,130\u00a0km/h (700\u00a0mph) in the Me 163B V18 bearing the Stammkennzeichen code of VA+SP, nearly losing the complete rudder surface in the process to flutter.[4][5][6] It is unclear, however, if sufficient altitude was attained to make this a true supersonic flight.[citation needed]\n Dittmar died in a crash in 1960 while test-flying a light aircraft of his own design, the HD-153 Motor-M\u00f6we, near Essen/M\u00fclheim airport.[7]\n ", "tags": ["1911 births", "1960 deaths", "German World War II pilots", "Glider pilots", "Test pilots", "Flight speed record holders", "Glider flight record holders", "German aviation record holders", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2018", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Heini Dittmar (March 30, 1912, Bad Kissingen, Unterfranken, Germany \u2013 April 28, 1960 near M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr, West Germany) was a record-breaking German glider pilot.\nInspired by the example of his glider flying brother Edgar, Dittmar took an apprenticeship at the German Institute for Gliding (DFS).
