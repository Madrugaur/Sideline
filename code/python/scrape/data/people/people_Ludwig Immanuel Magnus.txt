{"name": "Ludwig Immanuel Magnus", "content": "Ludwig Immanuel Magnus (March 15, 1790\u2013September 25, 1861) was a German Jewish mathematician who, in 1831, published a paper about the inversion transformation, which leads to inversive geometry.\n His reputation as a mathematician was established by 1834 and an honorary doctorate conferred on him by the University of Bonn. His work appeared in Gergonne's Annales de math\u00e9matiques pures et appliqu\u00e9es vols. xi and xvi (1820\u201325); in Crelle's Journal, vols. v, vii, viii, and ix (1830\u201332); in the third part (1833) of Meier Hirsch's \"Sammlung Geometrischer Aufgaben\"; and in \"Sammlung von Aufgaben und Lehrs\u00e4tzen aus der Analytischen Geometrie des Raumes\" (published in 1837, written earlier).\n He studied Euclid while working in his uncle's bank. From 1813 to 1815 he served as a gunner in the Napoleonic Wars. After the war he returned to banking and taught mathematics until 1834, when the founder of the academy at which he was teaching died. He then left teaching and spent nine years as the head revenue officer for the Berliner Kassenverein, retiring in 1843.\n \n ", "tags": ["1790 births", "1861 deaths", "19th-century German mathematicians", "German Jews", "Geometers", "CS1 errors: missing title", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia with no article parameter", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Ludwig Immanuel Magnus (March 15, 1790\u2013September 25, 1861) was a German Jewish mathematician who, in 1831, published a paper about the inversion transformation, which leads to inversive geometry.\nHis reputation as a mathematician was established by 1834 and an honorary doctorate conferred on him by the University of Bonn.
