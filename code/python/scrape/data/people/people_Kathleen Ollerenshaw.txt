{"name": "Kathleen Ollerenshaw", "content": "\n Dame Kathleen Mary Ollerenshaw, DBE (n\u00e9e Timpson; 1 October 1912 \u2013 10 August 2014) was a British mathematician and politician who was Lord Mayor of Manchester from 1975 to 1976 and an advisor on educational matters to Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s.\n Born Kathleen Mary Timpson in Withington, Manchester, where she attended Lady Barn House School (1918\u20131926).[1] She was a grandchild of the founder of the Timpson shoe repair business, who had moved to Manchester from Kettering and established the business there by 1870.[2] From age eight, she was almost completely deaf. She became fascinated with mathematics, inspired by the Lady Barn headmistress, Miss Jenkin Jones. While at Lady Barn, she met her future husband, Robert Ollerenshaw.\n As a young woman, she attended St Leonards School and Sixth Form College in St Andrews, Scotland where today the house of young male boarders is named after her. At the age of 19 she gained admittance to Somerville College, Oxford, to study mathematics. She completed her doctorate at Somerville in 1945 on \"Critical Lattices\" under the supervision of Theo Chaundy. She wrote five original research papers which were sufficient for her to earn her DPhil degree without the need of a formal written thesis.[3]\n While an undergraduate, she became engaged to Robert Ollerenshaw, who became a distinguished military surgeon (Colonel R.G.W. Ollerenshaw, ERD, TD, BM, DMRD)[4][5][6] and a pioneer of medical illustration. They married in September 1939 and had two children, Charles (1941\u20131999) and Florence (1946\u20131972). In 1942 she suffered a miscarriage and \"cried nonstop for three days\" as a result of stress when her husband was posted abroad for front-line war service.[7]\n After the Second World War, the Ollerenshaws moved to Manchester, where Kathleen worked as a part-time lecturer in the mathematics department at Manchester University while raising her children and continued her work on lattices. In 1949, at the age of 37, she received her first effective hearing aid. \n Outside of academics, Ollerenshaw served as a Conservative Councillor for Rusholme for twenty-six years (1956\u20131981), Lord Mayor of Manchester (1975\u20131976), High Sheriff of Greater Manchester from 1978 to 1979, and the prime motivator in the creation of the Royal Northern College of Music. She was made a Freeman of the City of Manchester and was an advisor on educational matters to Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s.\n She was President of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications from 1978 to 1979.[8] She published at least 26 mathematical papers, her best-known contribution being to most-perfect pandiagonal magic squares.[9] Upon her death, she left a legacy in trust to support distinguished research visitors and public engagement activities at the School of Mathematics, University of Manchester. An annual public lecture at the University is named in her honour.[10]\n An amateur astronomer, Ollerenshaw donated her telescope to Lancaster University, and an observatory there bears her name. She was an honorary member of the Manchester Astronomical Society and held the post of Vice-President for a number of years.\n Ollerenshaw attended St Leonards School in St Andrews, Fife, and served as the school's president from 1981 to 2003. She was succeeded by Baroness Byford, Conservative spokeswoman in the House of Lords. She turned 100 in October 2012.[11]\n She died in Didsbury on 10 August 2014, at the age of 101.[12] Her husband and both their children had predeceased her.\n ", "tags": ["1912 births", "2014 deaths", "Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire", "People educated at St Leonards School", "Alumni of Somerville College, Oxford", "Conservative Party (UK) councillors", "People from Withington", "Amateur astronomers", "British astronomers", "20th-century British mathematicians", "21st-century British mathematicians", "Mathematics educators", "Recreational mathematicians", "British women mathematicians", "Women astronomers", "Deaf politicians", "Women mayors of places in England", "Lord Mayors of Manchester", "High Sheriffs of Greater Manchester", "British centenarians", "20th-century British women scientists", "Deaf people from England", "Fellows of Somerville College, Oxford", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Women centenarians", "Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "EngvarB from March 2020", "Use dmy dates from March 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "English mathematician\n\n\nDameKathleen OllerenshawDBEOllerenshaw signing a book in the Alan Turing BuildingBornKathleen Mary Timpson(1912-10-01)1 October 1912Withington, Manchester, EnglandDied10 August 2014(2014-08-10) (aged\u00a0101)Didsbury, EnglandAlma\u00a0materSomerville College, OxfordSpouse(s)Robert Ollerenshaw\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01939; died\u00a01986)\u200bChildren2Scientific careerFieldsMagic squareLatticesInstitutionsUniversity of ManchesterThesis\u00a0(1945)Doctoral advisorTheodore William Chaundy\n\nDame Kathleen Mary Ollerenshaw, DBE (n\u00e9e Timpson; 1 October 1912 \u2013 10 August 2014) was a British mathematician and politician who was Lord Mayor of Manchester from 1975 to 1976 and an advisor on educational matters to Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Honours and legacy\n4 Notes\n5 Bibliography\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nBorn Kathleen Mary Timpson in Withington, Manchester, where she attended Lady Barn House School (1918\u20131926).[1] She was a grandchild of the founder of the Timpson shoe repair business, who had moved to Manchester from Kettering and established the business there by 1870.[2] From age eight, she was almost completely deaf.
