Greenwald is Professor of Mathematics at Appalachian State University and Faculty Affiliate of Gender, Women's and Sexuality Studies.[1]\n Greenwald's research interests include Geometry and the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. She also investigates connections between mathematics and society, such as women, minorities and popular culture. For example, she was part of a team that looked into allusions to mathematics in The Simpsons.[2]\n In 1991, Greenwald graduated summa cum laude with honors in mathematics from Union College with a BS degree.[3]\nIn 1998, she earned a PhD in mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her thesis in Riemannian geometry was entitled Diameters of Spherical Alexandrov Spaces and Constant Curvature One Orbifolds and was supervised by Wolfgang Ziller[4]\n Greenwald is a Professor of Mathematics at Appalachian State University and Faculty Affiliate of the Gender, Women's and Sexuality Studies program there. She has published numerous articles and books in the areas of Riemannian Geometry, math education, and math in society.[5] Greenwald has been trying to get young women in Girl Scouts interested in STEM.  She and Appalachian State colleagues Amber Mellon and Jill Thomley have created a merit badge in mathematics to foster interest in mathematics.[6][7] Greenwald has also created a series of short video interviews of women in STEM who were former Girl Scout members.  This is a work in progress.
