{"name": "Jennifer Switkes", "content": "Jennifer Switkes is a Canadian-American applied mathematician interested in mathematical modeling and operations research,[1] and also known for her volunteer work teaching mathematics in prisons.[2] She is an associate professor of mathematics at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona),[3] where she is associate chair of the mathematics department.[4]\n Switkes was born in Canada but moved as a child to Northern California.[2]\nShe is a 1994 graduate of Harvey Mudd College,[1]\nwhere she completed a double major in mathematics and physics as well as earning credits towards a teaching credential. However, her experience as a student teacher at a middle school convinced her that she was not fully prepared to continue as a teacher, and she returned to graduate school instead.[2]\n Her doctoral research at Claremont Graduate University concerned mathematical biology, and more specifically mosaic coevolution; her 2000 dissertation, The Geographic Mosaic Theory in Relation to Coevolutionary Interactions, was jointly supervised by Michael E.
