She received the Louise Hay Award from the Association for Women in Mathematics in 2007.[1]\n Warfield's father was mathematician Edward J.

She worked with Project SEED, a highly regarded mathematics program whose goal was to promote sense-making mathematical activities for fourth through sixth graders. She addressed issues of teacher preparation and enhancement. She collaborated with the French mathematician Guy\nBrousseau, a pioneer in the \u201cdidactics of mathematics,\u201d the scientific study of issues in mathematics teaching and learning.[4] She has been an active member of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM). She has chaired the Education Committee, has served as Education Column Editor for the AWM Newsletter, and was elected as a Member-at-large to the Executive Committee.
