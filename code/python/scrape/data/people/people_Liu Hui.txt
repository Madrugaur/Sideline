For example, he found that a wedge with rectangular base and both sides sloping could be broken down into a pyramid and a tetrahedral wedge.[7] He also found that a wedge with trapezoid base and both sides sloping could be made to give two tetrahedral wedges separated by a pyramid. In his commentaries on the Nine Chapters, he presented:\n\nAn algorithm for calculation of pi (\u03c0) in the comments to chapter 1.[8] He calculated pi to \n\n\n\n3.141024\n<\n\u03c0\n<\n3.142074\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 3.141024<\\pi <3.142074}\n\n with a 192 (= 64 \u00d7 3) sided polygon. Archimedes used a circumscribed 96-gon to obtain the inequality \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n<\n\n\n\n22\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi <{\\tfrac {22}{7}}}\n\n, and then used an inscribed 96-gon to obtain the inequality \n\n\n\n\n\n\n223\n71\n\n\n\n<\n\u03c0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {223}{71}}<\\pi }\n\n. Liu Hui used only one inscribed 96-gon to obtain his \u03c0 inequality, and his results were a bit more accurate than Archimedes'.[9] But he commented that 3.142074 was too large, and picked the first three digits of \u03c0  =  3.141024 ~3.14 and put it in fraction form \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n=\n\n\n\n157\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi ={\\tfrac {157}{50}}}\n\n. He later invented a quick method and obtained \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n=\n3.1416\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi =3.1416}\n\n, which he checked with a 3072-gon (= 512 \u00d7 6). Nine Chapters had used the value 3 for \u03c0, but Zhang Heng (78-139 AD) had previously estimated pi to the square root of 10.\nGaussian elimination.\nCavalieri's principle to find the volume of a cylinder and the intersection of two perpendicular cylinders[10][11] although this work was only finished by Zu Chongzhi and Zu Gengzhi. Liu's commentaries often include explanations why some methods work and why others do not. Although his commentary was a great contribution, some answers had slight errors which was later corrected by the Tang mathematician and Taoist believer Li Chunfeng.\nThrough his work in the Nine Chapters, he could have been the first mathematician to discover and compute with negative numbers; definitely before Ancient Indian mathematician Brahmagupta started using negative numbers.\n Survey of sea island\nLiu Hui also presented, in a separate appendix of 263 AD called Haidao Suanjing or The Sea Island Mathematical Manual, several problems related to surveying. This book contained many practical problems of geometry, including the measurement of the heights of Chinese pagoda towers.[12] This smaller work outlined instructions on how to measure distances and heights with \"tall surveyor's poles and horizontal bars fixed at right angles to them\".[13] With this, the following cases are considered in his work:\n\nThe measurement of the height of an island opposed to its sea level and viewed from the sea\nThe height of a tree on a hill\nThe size of a city wall viewed at a long distance\nThe depth of a ravine (using hence-forward cross-bars)\nThe height of a tower on a plain seen from a hill\nThe breadth of a river-mouth seen from a distance on land\nThe width of a valley seen from a cliff\nThe depth of a transparent pool\nThe width of a river as seen from a hill\nThe size of a city seen from a mountain.\nLiu Hui's information about surveying was known to his contemporaries as well.
