{"name": "Helmut H. Schaefer", "content": "Helmut Heinrich Schaefer (February 14, 1925 in Grossenhain, Germany \u2013 December 16, 2005 in T\u00fcbingen, Germany) was a German mathematician at home on both sides of the Atlantic. His work centered on functional analysis. His two best known scientific monographs are titled Topological Vector Spaces (1966) and Banach Lattices and Positive Operators (1974). The first of these was subsequently translated into Spanish and Russian. The second made him an internationally recognized and leading scholar in this particular field of mathematics. (Roquette & Wolff, 2006)\n As teenager Helmut Schaefer attended the Sankt Afra boarding school in Meissen, Germany on a merit based scholarship. In 1943, then 18, he was recruited to serve as interpreter of Anglo-American intelligence. After the war he studied mathematics in Dresden and Leipzig, where he earned his doctorate in 1951 and his habilitation in 1954. Prof. Ernst H\u00f6lder served as his academic advisor. In 1956 he accepted an offer from the University of Halle (Saale) as professor of mathematics. \n Helmut Schaefer, his wife and two children escaped from East Germany to the Federal Republic in 1957, where for one year he worked under Prof. Gottfried K\u00f6the at the University of Mainz. In 1958 he became Associate Professor at Washington State University at Pullman and a few years later he, his wife and now three children moved on to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Then in 1963 he accepted an offer from the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany where he remained until his retirement in 1990. Interrupting this period on several occasions and following retirement in T\u00fcbingen he spent a number of one-year terms or semesters as visiting or full professor at various American universities, including the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Maryland at College Park, the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Texas A&M University at College Station, and Florida Atlantic University at Boca Raton. In T\u00fcbingen he served two terms as department head. He remained active in mathematical research until the year 1999, at which point he completely dedicated himself to his lifelong hobby of astronomy, especially astrophotography.\n In 1978, Helmut Schaefer was accepted as full member of the Mathematics and Natural Sciences Class of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences. Earlier, he was admitted to the Academy of Sciences in Zaragoza (Spain). Over the years, he was able to attract many students to functional analysis, combining an expectation of high achievement with a tolerant, humorous, and factual attitude. Ten of his doctoral students went on to become professors at various universities in Germany and the U.S. (Roquette & Wolff, 2006) His doctoral students include Wolfgang Arendt\u00a0[de], Rainer Nagel\u00a0[de], and Bertram John Walsh.\n ", "tags": ["1925 births", "2005 deaths", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Functional analysts", "Astrophotography", "University of T\u00fcbingen faculty", "Florida Atlantic University faculty", "University of Michigan faculty", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " Helmut Schaefer in 1989\nHelmut Heinrich Schaefer (February 14, 1925 in Grossenhain, Germany \u2013 December 16, 2005 in T\u00fcbingen, Germany) was a German mathematician at home on both sides of the Atlantic.
