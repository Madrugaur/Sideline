{"name": "Heinrich Martin Weber", "content": "Heinrich Martin Weber (5 March 1842, Heidelberg, Germany \u2013 17 May 1913, Stra\u00dfburg, Alsace-Lorraine, German Empire, now Strasbourg, France) was a German mathematician.[1] Weber's main work was in algebra, number theory, and analysis. He is best known for his text Lehrbuch der Algebra published in 1895 and much of it is his original research in algebra and number theory. His work Theorie der algebraischen Functionen einer Ver\u00e4nderlichen (with Dedekind) established an algebraic foundation for Riemann surfaces, allowing a purely algebraic formulation of the Riemann-Roch theorem. Weber's research papers were numerous, most of them appearing in Crelle's Journal or Mathematische Annalen. He was the editor of Riemann's collected works.\n Weber was born in Heidelberg, Baden, and entered the University of Heidelberg in 1860. In 1866 he became a privatdozent, and in 1869 he was appointed as extraordinary professor at that school. Weber also taught in Zurich at the Federal Polytechnic Institute, today the ETH Zurich, at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg, and at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg. His final post was at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Universit\u00e4t Stra\u00dfburg, Alsace-Lorraine, where he died.\n In 1893 in Chicago, his paper Zur Theorie der ganzzahligen algebraischen Gleichungen was read (but not by him) at the International Mathematical Congress held in connection with the World's Columbian Exposition.[2] In 1895 and in 1904 he was president of the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung. His doctoral students include Heinrich Brandt, E. V. Huntington, Louis Karpinski, and Friedrich Levi.\n ", "tags": ["1842 births", "1913 deaths", "19th-century German mathematicians", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Algebraists", "Number theorists", "People from Heidelberg", "People from the Grand Duchy of Baden", "Heidelberg University alumni", "Heidelberg University faculty", "University of K\u00f6nigsberg faculty", "Technical University of Berlin faculty", "University of Strasbourg faculty", "Heads of universities in Germany", "ETH Zurich faculty", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RSL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Not to be confused with Heinrich Friedrich Weber.\nHeinrich Martin WeberBorn(1842-03-05)5 March 1842Heidelberg, GermanyDied17 May 1913(1913-05-17) (aged\u00a071)Stra\u00dfburg, Alsace-Lorraine, German EmpireNationalityGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ErlangenUniversity of HeidelbergKnown\u00a0forAbstract algebraNumber theoryScientific careerFieldsMathematicsDoctoral advisorOtto Hesse\n\nHeinrich Martin Weber (5 March 1842, Heidelberg, Germany \u2013 17 May 1913, Stra\u00dfburg, Alsace-Lorraine, German Empire, now Strasbourg, France) was a German mathematician.[1] Weber's main work was in algebra, number theory, and analysis.
