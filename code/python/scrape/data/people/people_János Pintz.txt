Ruzsa he improved a result of Linnik by showing that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes and at most 8 powers of 2.\nGoldston, S. W. Graham, Pintz, and Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m proved that the difference between numbers which are products of exactly 2 primes is infinitely often at most 6.[6]\nSee also[edit]\nPrime gap\nLandau's problems\nFazekas Mih\u00e1ly Gimn\u00e1zium\nMaier's theorem\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Peter Hermann, Antal Pasztor: Magyar \u00e9s nemzetk\u00f6zi ki kicsoda, 1994\n\n^ Goldston, D.
