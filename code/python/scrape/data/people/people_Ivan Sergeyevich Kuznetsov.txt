Born into a working-class family, Kuznetsov independently broke into the elite architecture society of Moscow. He worked in many different styles but was most successful in Neoclassical architecture and Russian Revival. He excelled in industrial architecture and designed more than 600 buildings through the commissions of Nikolay Vtorov. Kuznetsov remained in high demand during the Soviet period.\n Kuznetsov was born on May 27, 1867, the son of a peasant-mason in Porteskoye, a settlement in Vladimir Oblast. In 1884, Kuznetsov was accepted to the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, and completed his schooling in 1889 with a Big Silver Medal, granting him the right to oversee construction work. From 1887 to 1895, he was assistant to Fyodor Schechtel, and from 1889 he was working for the Department of Empress Maria (charitable branch of the Imperial government). From 1895 to 1900, Kuznetsov continued his studies in the Imperial Academy of Arts. He studied in Europe, and received the degree of an artist-architect.\n In the 1890s he designed factories, and civic buildings in the Ivanovo Oblast for the Krasilshikov family in Vichuga. In Moscow, Kuznetsov became close to merchant families Bayev and Medvednikov. Among the major early constructions of Kuznetsov was the Medvednikov grammar school (Russian: \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f) in Moscow, which became a model for public buildings in the Art Nouveau style. Then, in the first half of the 1900s, Kuznetsov restored the frescoes and decoration in Assumption Cathedral of Joseph-Volokolamsk Monastery, as well as in the Epiphany Cathedral at Elokhovo.\n Kuznetsov was a prominent member of the Kadet party and member of Moscow Duma.\n \"Delovoy Dvor\"\n Povarskaya Street, 9\n Savvinskoye Podvorie\n In 1905-1907, Kuznetsov built his most known building - nowadays hidden behind facades of newer buildings on Tverskaya Street - Savvinskoye Podvorie (Metochion) (Russian: \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0435).

Cooperation with Abramtsevo continued through 1908-1910, when, by the commission of Ivan Kokorev, Kuznetsov built Voznesenski Temple in Tesino near Vichuga, usually called Red Church (Russian: \u0412\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043c - \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c).

He built weapons factories for Vtorov and Mikhelson in Moscow, Serpukhov, Zatishye (Elektrostal), Bogorodsk (Noginsk).\n Kuznetsov in Soviet years refrained from political discussions and worked for the Soviet construction industry until his death; with his last position being the chief architect of the Sochi resort (beginning from 1937). He died the 3rd of June, 1942, and was buried at the Vvedenskoye Cemetery in Moscow.\n ", "tags": ["1867 births", "1942 deaths", "Neoclassical architects", "Russian architects", "Soviet architects", "Art Nouveau architects", "Burials at Vvedenskoye Cemetery", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Russian architect\nFor other people named Ivan Kuznetsov, see Ivan Kuznetsov (disambiguation).\nIvan Sergeyevich KuznetsovBorn(1867-05-27)May 27, 1867Poretskoye, Vladimir OblastDiedJune 3, 1942(1942-06-03) (aged\u00a075)MoscowNationalityRussianOccupationArchitectBuildingsSavvinskoe Podvorie (1905-1907), Red Church (1909), Delovoy Dvor (1911-1913)\n\nIvan Sergeyevich Kuznetsov (Russian: \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0301\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043e\u0432) (May 27, 1867\u00a0\u2013 June 3, 1942) was a Russian architect primarily known for his pre-1917 works in Moscow and Vichuga.
