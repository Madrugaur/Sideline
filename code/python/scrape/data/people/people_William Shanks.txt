{"name": "William Shanks", "content": "William Shanks (25 January 1812 \u2013 June 1882)[1] was a British amateur mathematician.\n Shanks is famous for his calculation of \u03c0 to 707 places, accomplished in 1873, which, however, was only correct up to the first 527 places.[2][3] This error was highlighted in 1944 by D. F. Ferguson (using a mechanical desk calculator).[4]\n Shanks earned his living by owning a boarding school at Houghton-le-Spring, which left him enough time to spend on his hobby of calculating mathematical constants. His routine was as follows: he would calculate new digits all morning; and then he would spend all afternoon checking his morning's work.  To calculate \u03c0, Shanks used Machin's formula:\n Shanks's approximation was the longest expansion of \u03c0 until the advent of the digital electronic computer about one century later.\n Shanks also calculated e and the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant \u03b3 to many decimal places. He published a table of primes up to 60 000 and found the natural logarithms of 2, 3, 5 and 10 to 137 places.\n Shanks died in Houghton-le-Spring, County Durham, England in June 1882, aged 70, and was buried at the local Hillside Cemetery on 17 June 1882.[5]\n ", "tags": ["1812 births", "1882 deaths", "19th-century English mathematicians", "Pi", "Amateur mathematicians", "People from Houghton-le-Spring", "Articles with hCards", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "For the Scottish artist, see William Somerville Shanks.\nWilliam ShanksBorn(1812-01-25)25 January 1812Corsenside, Northumberland, EnglandDied1882 (aged 70)Houghton-le-Spring, County Durham, EnglandScientific careerFieldsschoolmaster, mathematicianInstitutionsSchool at Houghton-le-Spring\n\n Shanks' approximation to \u03c0, published in 1853\nWilliam Shanks (25 January 1812 \u2013 June 1882)[1] was a British amateur mathematician.\nShanks is famous for his calculation of \u03c0 to 707 places, accomplished in 1873, which, however, was only correct up to the first 527 places.[2][3] This error was highlighted in 1944 by D.
