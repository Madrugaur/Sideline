{"name": "Federigo Enriques", "content": "Abramo Giulio Umberto Federigo Enriques (5 January 1871 \u2013 14 June 1946) was an Italian mathematician, now known principally as the first to give a classification of algebraic surfaces in birational geometry, and other contributions in algebraic geometry.\n Enriques was born in Livorno, and brought up in Pisa, in a Sephardi Jewish family of Portuguese descent.
