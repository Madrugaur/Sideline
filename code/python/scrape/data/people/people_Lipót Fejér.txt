{"name": "Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r", "content": "Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r (or Leopold Fej\u00e9r, Hungarian pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8f\u025bje\u02d0r]; 9 February 1880 \u2013 15 October 1959) was a Hungarian mathematician of Jewish heritage. Fej\u00e9r was born Leopold Weisz,[1][2][3] and changed to the Hungarian name Fej\u00e9r[4] around 1900.\n Fej\u00e9r studied mathematics and physics at the University of Budapest and at the University of Berlin, where he was taught by Hermann Schwarz.  In 1902 he earned his doctorate from University of Budapest (today E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University). From 1902 to 1905 Fej\u00e9r taught there and from 1905 until 1911 he taught at Franz Joseph University in Kolozsv\u00e1r in Austria-Hungary (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania). In 1911 Fej\u00e9r was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the University of Budapest and he held that post until his death. He was elected corresponding member (1908), member (1930) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\n During his period in the chair at Budapest Fej\u00e9r led a highly successful Hungarian school of analysis. He was the thesis advisor of mathematicians such as John von Neumann, Paul Erd\u0151s, George P\u00f3lya and P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n.\n Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r is buried in Kerepesi Cemetery in Budapest.\n Fej\u00e9r's research concentrated on harmonic analysis and, in particular, Fourier series.\n Fej\u00e9r collaborated to produce important papers, one with Carath\u00e9odory on entire functions in 1907 and another major work with Frigyes Riesz in 1922 on conformal mappings (specifically, a short proof of the Riemann mapping theorem).\n If you could see him in his rather Bohemian attire (which was, I suspect, carefully chosen) you would find him very eccentric. Yet he would not appear so in his natural habitat, in a certain section of Budapest middle-class society, many members of which had the same manners, if not quite the same mannerisms, as Fej\u00e9r \u2014 there he would appear about half eccentric. P\u00f3lya writes the following about Fej\u00e9r, telling us much about his personality:[5]\n He had artistic tastes. He deeply loved music and was a good pianist. He liked a well-turned phrase. 'As to earning a living', he said, 'a professor's salary is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition.' Once he was very angry with a colleague who happened to be a topologist, and explaining the case at length he wound up by declaring '... and what he is saying is a topological mapping of the truth'.\n\nHe had a quick eye for foibles and miseries; in seemingly dull situations he noticed points that were unexpectedly funny or unexpectedly pathetic. He carefully cultivated his talent of raconteur; when he told, with his characteristic gestures, of the little shortcomings of a certain great mathematician, he was irresistible. The hours spent in continental coffee houses with Fej\u00e9r discussing mathematics and telling stories are a cherished recollection for many of us. Fej\u00e9r presented his mathematical remarks with the same verve as his stories, and this may have helped him in winning the lasting interest of so many younger men in his problems.\n In the same article P\u00f3lya writes about Fej\u00e9r's style of mathematics:\n Fej\u00e9r talked about a paper he was about to write up. 'When I write a paper,' he said, 'I have to rederive for myself the rules of differentiation and sometimes even the commutative law of multiplication.' These words stuck in my memory and years later I came to think that they expressed an essential aspect of Fej\u00e9r's mathematical talent; his love for the intuitively clear detail.\n\nIt was not given to him to solve very difficult problems or to build vast conceptual structures. Yet he could perceive the significance, the beauty, and the promise of a rather concrete not too large problem, foresee the possibility of a solution and work at it with intensity. And, when he had found the solution, he kept on working at it with loving care, till each detail became fully transparent.\n\nIt is due to such care spent on the elaboration of the solution that Fej\u00e9r's papers are very clearly written, and easy to read and most of his proofs appear very clear and simple. Yet only the very naive may think that it is easy to write a paper that is easy to read, or that it is a simple thing to point out a significant problem that is capable of a simple solution.\n Mikol\u00e1s, Mikl\u00f3s (1970\u20131980). \"Fej\u00e9r, Lip\u00f3t\".
