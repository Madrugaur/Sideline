She holds a Canada 150 Research Chair in Mathematics for Evolution, Infection and Public Health at Simon Fraser University (SFU).\n Colijn earned her undergraduate degree from the University of British Columbia before enrolling at York University for her Master's degree in environmental studies and the University of Waterloo for her PhD.[1] She completed her post-doctoral training with Michael Mackey at McGill University and later studied epidemiology with Megan Murray at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.[2]\n Following her post-doctoral training, Colijn joined the University of Bristol's Department of Engineering Maths until 2011 when she moved to Imperial College London.[2] While at Imperial College London, Colijn earned an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Fellowship in order to study how to improve scientists ability to infer the ecological processes shaping a pathogen's evolution.[3]\n In 2017, the Government of Canada announced the hiring of four Canada 150 Research Chairs, including Colijn.[4] The program's initiative was to \"enhance Canada's reputation as a global centre for science, research and innovation excellence\" and Colijn's focus at Simon Fraser University (SFU) was on making \"connections between mathematics and public health, using diverse data to understand how pathogens adapt and spread.\"[5]\n In February 2020, Colijn, Jukka Corander, and Nick Croucher published a study in the journal Nature Microbiology regarding vaccines.
