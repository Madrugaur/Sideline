{"name": "Marcellin Berthelot", "content": "\n Pierre Eug\u00e8ne Marcellin Berthelot FRS FRSE (French:\u00a0[b\u025b\u0281t\u0259lo]; 1827\u20131907) was a French chemist and politician noted for the Thomsen\u2013Berthelot principle of thermochemistry. He synthesized many organic compounds from inorganic substances,[1] providing a large amount of counter-evidence to the theory of J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius that organic compounds required organisms in their synthesis.\nBerthelot was convinced that chemical synthesis would revolutionize the food industry by the year 2000, and that synthesized foods would replace farms and pastures. \"Why not\", he asked, \"if it proved cheaper and better to make the same materials than to grow them?\"[1][2]\n He was considered \"one of the most famous chemists in the world.\"[2] Upon being appointed to the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs for the French government in 1895, he was considered \"the most eminent living chemist\" in France.[3] \nIn 1901, he was elected as one of the \"Forty Immortals\" of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.[4][5]\nHe gave all his discoveries not only to the French government but to humanity.[6]\n He was born in Rue du Mouton, Paris,[7] France, on 25 October 1827 the son of a doctor. He decided with his friend, the great historian Ernest Renan, not to attend a grande \u00e9cole where the vast majority of intellectuals were being educated.[8]  After doing well at school in history and philosophy, he became a scientist.\n He was an atheist but was very influenced by his wife, who was a Calvinist[9] (his wife came from Louis Breguet's family).[10][11]\n The fundamental conception that underlay all Berthelot's chemical work was that all chemical phenomena depend on the action of physical forces which can be determined and measured. When he began his active career it was generally believed that, although some instances of the synthetic production of organic substances had been observed, on the whole organic chemistry remained an analytical science and could not become a constructive one, because the formation of the substances with which it deals required the intervention of vital activity in some shape.[12] He engaged in a long argument with Louis Pasteur on the subject of vitalism, in which Pasteur took the vitalist position on the basis of his work on alcoholic fermentation.[13]\n To this attitude he offered uncompromising opposition, and by the synthetic production of numerous hydrocarbons, natural fats, sugars and other bodies he proved that organic compounds can be formed by ordinary methods of chemical manipulation and obey the same principles as inorganic substances, thus exhibiting the \"creative character in virtue of which chemistry actually realizes the abstract conceptions of its theories and classifications\u2014a prerogative so far possessed neither by the natural nor by the historical sciences.\"[12]\n In 1863 he became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine; he was also awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1880.[14] In 1881 he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[15]\n His investigations on the synthesis of organic compounds were published in numerous papers and books, including Chimie organique fond\u00e9e sur la synth\u00e8se (1860) and Les Carbures d'hydrog\u00e8ne (1901). He stated that chemical phenomena are not governed by any peculiar laws special to themselves, but are explicable in terms of the general laws of mechanics that are in operation throughout the universe; and this view he developed, with the aid of thousands of experiments, in his M\u00e9canique chimique (1878) and his Thermochimie (1897). This branch of study naturally conducted him to the investigation of explosives, and on the theoretical side led to the results published in his work Sur la force de la poudre et des mati\u00e8res explosives (1872), while in practical terms it enabled him to render important services to his country as president of the scientific defence committee during the siege of Paris (1870\u20131871) and subsequently as chief of the French explosives committee. He performed experiments to determine gas pressures during hydrogen explosions using a special chamber fitted with a piston, and was able to distinguish burning of mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen from true explosions.\n During later life he researched and wrote books on the early history of chemistry such as Les Origines de l'alchimie (1885)[16] and Introduction \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude de la chimie des anciens et du moyen \u00e2ge (1889),[17] He also translated various old Greek, Syriac and Arabic treatises on alchemy and chemistry: Collection des anciens alchimistes grecs (1887\u20131888)[18] and La Chimie au moyen \u00e2ge (1893).[19] He was the author of Science et philosophie (1886),[20] which contains a well-known letter to Renan on \"La Science id\u00e9ale et la science positive,\" of La R\u00e9volution chimique, Lavoisier (1890),[21] of Science et morale (1897),[22] and of numerous articles in La Grande Encyclop\u00e9die, which he helped to establish.\n Berthelot died suddenly on 18 March 1907, immediately after the death of his wife Sophie Niaudet (1837\u20131907), in Paris. His professorship was filled by Emil Jungfleisch.\n He was buried with his wife in the Panth\u00e9on.  He had six children:[23] Marcel Andr\u00e9 (1862\u20131939), Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (1863\u20131895), Camille (1864\u20131928), Daniel (1865\u20131927), Philippe (1866\u20131934), and Ren\u00e9 (1872\u20131960).\n Auguste Rodin created a bust of Berthelot.\n ", "tags": ["1827 births", "1907 deaths", "Politicians from Paris", "Members of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise", "Coll\u00e8ge de France faculty", "French atheists", "French chemists", "French scientists", "French Life Senators", "Grand Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Burials at the Panth\u00e9on, Paris", "Recipients of the Copley Medal", "Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences", "Officers of the French Academy of Sciences", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)", "Scientists from Paris", "Use dmy dates from April 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing French-language text", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "AC with 27 elements", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nMarcellin BerthelotFRS FRSEBornPierre Eug\u00e8ne Marcellin Berthelot(1827-10-25)25 October 1827Paris, FranceDied18 March 1907(1907-03-18) (aged\u00a079)Paris, FranceKnown\u00a0forThomsen\u2013Berthelot principleSpouse(s)Sophie NiaudetChildrenAndr\u00e9Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8neCamilleDanielPhilippeRen\u00e9AwardsDavy Medal (1883)Copley Medal (1900)Scientific careerFieldsChemistry (thermochemistry)InfluencesAntoine J\u00e9r\u00f4me Balard\n\nPierre Eug\u00e8ne Marcellin Berthelot FRS FRSE (French:\u00a0[b\u025b\u0281t\u0259lo]; 1827\u20131907) was a French chemist and politician noted for the Thomsen\u2013Berthelot principle of thermochemistry.

He was permanent secretary of the French Academy, having succeeded the giant Louis Pasteur, the renowned microbiologist. Unlike Delage, an agnostic, Berthelot was an atheist\u2014and militantly so.\n\n^ Thomas de Wesselow (2012). The Sign: The Shroud of Turin and the Secret of the Resurrection. Penguin.
