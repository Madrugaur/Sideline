She stirred controversy in the Muslim world and received world-wide media coverage in 2006 with her assertion - outlined in her book from the previous year - that the headscarf worn by Arab women did not originate in the Muslim world, but was actually worn five thousand years earlier by Sumerian priestesses as a means of initiating young men into sex.\n Muazzez \u0130lmiye \u0130til's parents were Crimean Tatars both of whose families had immigrated to Turkey, with her father's side settling in the town of Merzifon, and her mother's side in the northwestern city of Bursa, Turkey's fourth-largest, which was, at the time, a major regional administrative center of the Ottoman Empire. [1]  Muazzez Ilmiye was born in Bursa, a few weeks before the outbreak of World War I and, by the time of her fifth birthday in 1919, the Greek Army's invasion of \u0130zmir prompted her father, who was a teacher, to seek safety for the family by moving to the city of \u00c7orum where young Muazzez completed her primary studies.  She subsequently returned to Bursa and, by the time of her 17th birthday in 1931, graduated from its training facility for elementary school teachers.\n After nearly five years of educating children in another northwestern city, Eski\u015fehir, she began studies in 1936 at Ankara University's  Department of Hittitology, established the previous year by modern Turkey's founding father, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.  Among her teachers were two of the period's most eminent scholars of Hittite culture and history, Hans Gustav G\u00fcterbock and Benno Landsberger, both Hitler-era German-Jewish refugees, who spent World War II as professors in Turkey.[2]\n Upon receiving her degree in 1940, she began a multi-decade career at Museum of the Ancient Orient, one of three such institutions comprising Istanbul Archaeology Museums, as a resident specialist in the field of cuneiform tablets, thousands of which were being stored untranslated and unclassified in the facility's archives.  In the intervening years, due to her efforts in the deciphering and publication of the tablets, the Museum became a Middle Eastern languages learning center attended by ancient history researchers from every part of the world.[2]\n Married to M.

She has gained renown in her profession for the diligent and systematic investigation evident in her books, scholarly papers and general interest articles published in magazines and newspapers such as Belleten and Bilim ve \u00dctopya.  In 2002, her autobiography, \u00c7ivi \u00e7iviyi s\u00f6ker, framed as a series of interviews by journalist Serhat \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was published by the country's premier national financial institution T\u00fcrkiye \u0130\u015f Bankas\u0131.\n She and her publisher were charged with \"inciting hatred based on religious differences\".[3]  The dismissal of the charges in the first hearing on 31 October 2006, and her acquittal brought additional publicity to Prof. \u00c7\u0131\u011f.[4][5]\nIn her trial, she denied the charges, declaring \"I am a woman of science ...
