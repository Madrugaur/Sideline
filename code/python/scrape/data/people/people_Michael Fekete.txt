After completing his PhD he left to University of G\u00f6ttingen, which in those days was considered a mathematics hub, and subsequently returned to the University of Budapest, where he attained the title of Privatdozent. In addition, Fekete engaged in private mathematics tutoring. Among his students was J\u00e1nos Neumann, who, was later known in the United States as John von Neumann.
