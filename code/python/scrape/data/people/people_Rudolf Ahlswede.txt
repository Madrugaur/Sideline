{"name": "Rudolf Ahlswede", "content": "Rudolf F. Ahlswede (September 15, 1938  \u2013 December 18, 2010) was a German mathematician. Born in Dielmissen, Germany, he studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy. He wrote his Ph.D. thesis in 1966, at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, with the topic \"Contributions to the Shannon information theory in case of non-stationary channels\". He dedicated himself in his further career to information theory and became one of the leading representatives of this area worldwide.\n In 1977, he joined and held a Professorship at the University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany. In 1988, he received together with Imre Csisz\u00e1r the Best Paper Award of the IEEE Information Theory Society for work in the area of the hypothesis testing as well as in 1990 together with Gunter Dueck for a new theory of message identification. He has been awarded this prize twice. As an emeritus of Bielefeld University, Ahlswede received the Claude Elwood Shannon Award 2006 of the IEEE information Theory Society. The prize is designated after Claude Elwood Shannon and since 1974 for outstanding achievements in the area of the information theory. The prize went only five times to scientists from outside the USA. This is the beginning of a new theory known as Network coding.[1]\n Rudolf Ahlswede died on December 18, 2010, at the age of 72.\n ", "tags": ["1938 births", "2010 deaths", "German information theorists", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles lacking in-text citations from February 2013", "All articles lacking in-text citations", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\nThis article includes a list of general references, but it remains largely unverified because it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations.
