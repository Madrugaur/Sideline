{"name": "Xavier Hommaire de Hell", "content": "Ignace Xavier Morand Hommaire de Hell, often known as Xavier Hommaire de Hell, (24 November 1812 in Altkirch \u2013 29 August 1848 in Isfahan) was a French geographer, engineer and traveller who carried out research in Turkey, southern Russia and Persia.\n After attending school in Altkirch and Dijon, Hommaire graduated as an engineer at the \u00c9cole des Mines in Saint-\u00c9tienne in 1833. There he met Ad\u00e8le H\u00e9riot whom he married in 1834. In October 1835, he went Turkey where he coordinated the construction of a suspension bridge in Constantinople and a lighthouse on the Black Sea coast. In 1838, he arrived in southern Russia where he performed ethnographical research and geographical surveys. After he discovered coal resources along the Dnieper River, Czar Nicholas I awarded him the St Vladimir Cross. In 1842, while working on mining and road-building projects in Moldavia, he fell ill and returned to France. The following year he became a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9ologique and published a number of scientific papers. In 1844 the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie awarded him their Gold Medal .[1]\n With the help of his wife, he embarked on Les steppes de la mer Caspienne (1844\u20131847) and in 1845 was awarded the Legion of Honour.[2]\n After receiving a grant of 3,000 francs per year from the Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture, he left with his wife and the painter Jules Laurens on an extended journey to the Orient. In Turkey, he wrote reports on trade in the Bosporous and the Black Sea before proceeding to Persia. As he expected the journey to be difficult, he sent his wife back to France, travelling only with Laurens. In June 1847, they sailed to Trabzon, entering Persia through Diyarbakir and Lake Van that November. In February 1848, he finally arrived in Tehran after suffering from cholera and ophthalmia on the way. With the help of the French ambassador, he met Mohammad Shah Qajar who entrusted him with studying the feasibility of a canal bringing water from the River Shahrood to the Savojbolagh plain.  Hommaire left for Mazandaran in May 1848 where he carried out surveys including a study of the Mosque of Varamin. He returned to Tehran to complete his research notes and then travelled to Isfahan. He arrived there seriously ill and died two weeks later on 29 August 1848. Laurens sent his notes back to his wife in Paris who completed a full account of his travels (1856\u20131860) subsidized by the French authorities.[2]\n ", "tags": ["French geographers", "French engineers", "1812 births", "1848 deaths", "People from Altkirch", "Recipients of the Legion of Honour", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Burials in Iran", "Human geographers", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " Xavier Hommaire de Hell, drawing by Jules Laurens\nIgnace Xavier Morand Hommaire de Hell, often known as Xavier Hommaire de Hell, (24 November 1812 in Altkirch \u2013 29 August 1848 in Isfahan) was a French geographer, engineer and traveller who carried out research in Turkey, southern Russia and Persia.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 References\n3 Further reading\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nAfter attending school in Altkirch and Dijon, Hommaire graduated as an engineer at the \u00c9cole des Mines in Saint-\u00c9tienne in 1833.
