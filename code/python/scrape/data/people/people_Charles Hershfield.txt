{"name": "Charles Hershfield", "content": "Charles Hershfield, B.Sc., M.A.Sc, F.E.I.C, P.Eng. (1910\u20131990) was widely recognized by the engineering community and known for his innovative structural engineering solutions, as a senior assistant engineer and lieutenant with the Department of National Defense, a professor at the University of Toronto, as co-founder of the North American firm Morrison Hershfield, and as a prolific author. He was a lifelong advocate of education and the engineering profession.\n Hershfield' parents Aaron and Molly Hershfield left Teofipol, Ukraine in the mid-1890s for Manitoba, Canada in search of greater opportunities and in the hopes of starting a family. On December 24, 1910 their son Charles Hershfield was born. As a child and later in his teens, Hershfield's interests resided in music, baseball, carpentry, and mechanical engineering. He attended St. John's High School in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and even from a young age, highly valued his education.\n Hershfield later studied engineering at the University of Manitoba. Working with two of his classmates, H.F. Peters and W. Gruber, Hershfield submitted the thesis \"Some Tests of Welded Joints\". Hershfield graduated in 1930 with the degree of Bachelor of Science in civil engineering.\n During the summer periods as an undergraduate Hershfield worked for the Dominion Bridge Company in Winnipeg. Upon graduation and until 1932, in conjunction with the Winnipeg City Engineer, he was involved with structural design of bridges, viaducts and subways.\n Several years later Hershfield continued his education and received the degree of Master of Applied Science from the University of Toronto in 1950. His master's thesis was titled \"Series Expansion of Joint Rotations for the Analysis of Rigidly Framed Structures \".[1]\n In 1935 Hershfield moved to Toronto, Ontario and until 1941 was employed with Standard Iron and Steel Works where his skills and services were focused in structural design, estimating, contracting, detailing and supervision of the fabrication and erection of steel structures.\n From 1941 to 1943 he was a staff member of the Canadian Department of National Defense, Naval Service, Works and Building Branch as Senior Assistant Engineer, with the rank of Lieutenant. His work during this time included structural design on naval shore establishments including shops, storage facilities, training buildings, and drill halls, of wide variety as to size and materials of construction.[1]\n After leaving the naval service in 1943, Hershfield joined the staff of the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Toronto. Hershfield taught a variety of courses related to structural engineering and supervised many graduate students. He was also principal instructor in structural engineering in the School of Architecture at University of Toronto.[4]\n In 1946 Hershfield, along with Carson Morrison, Joe Millman, and Mark Huggins, responded to the post-war building boom by founding the engineering consulting firm Morrison Hershfield Millman and Huggins. The firm today exists under the name Morrison Hershfield, with offices across North America specializing in multidisciplinary engineering and related expertise.[5]\n Hershfield retired from teaching at the University of Toronto in 1976 after 31 years of service but continued to work closely with Morrison Hershfield almost up to the time of his death.\n ", "tags": ["1910 births", "1990 deaths", "Fellows of the Engineering Institute of Canada", "University of Toronto faculty", "Canadian civil engineers", "Articles with hCards", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "Charles HershfieldBornDecember 24, 1910Winnipeg, Manitoba CanadaDiedMarch 11, 1990Toronto, Ontario CanadaEducationB.Sc., Civil Engineering,University of Manitoba 1930[1]\n                        M.Sc.
