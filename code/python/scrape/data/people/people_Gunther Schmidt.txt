{"name": "Gunther Schmidt", "content": "Gunther Schmidt (born 1939, R\u00fcdersdorf) is a German mathematician who works also in informatics.\n Schmidt began studying Mathematics in 1957 at G\u00f6ttingen University. His academic teachers were in particular Kurt Reidemeister, Wilhelm Klingenberg and Karl Stein. In 1960 he transferred to Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen where he studied functions of several complex variables with Karl Stein. Schmidt wrote a thesis on analytic continuation of such functions.\n In 1962 Schmidt began work at TU M\u00fcnchen with students of Robert Sauer, in the beginning in labs and tutorials, later in mentoring and administration. Schmidt's interests turned toward programming when he collaborated with Hans Langmaack on rewriting and the braid group in 1969. Friedrich L. Bauer and Klaus Samelson were establishing software engineering at the university and Schmidt joined their group in 1974. In 1977 he submitted his Habilitation \"Programs as partial graphs\".[1]\n He became a professor in 1980. Shortly after that, he was appointed to hold the chair of the late Klaus Samelson for one and a half years. From 1988 until his retirement in 2004, he held a professorship at the Faculty for Computer Science of the Universit\u00e4t der Bundeswehr M\u00fcnchen. He was a classroom instructor for beginners courses as well as special courses in mathematical logic, semantics of programming languages, construction of compilers, and algorithmic languages. Working with Thomas Strohlein, he authored a textbook on relations and graphs, published in German in 1989 and English in 1993 and again in 2012.\n In 2001 he became involved in a large project (17 nations) with the European Cooperation in Science and Technology:[2] Schmidt was chairman of project COST 274 TARSKI (Theory and Application of Relational Structures as Knowledge Instruments).[3]\n In 2014 a festschrift was organized to celebrate his 75th year.[4]\n The calculus of relations had a relatively low profile among mathematical topics in the twentieth century, but Schmidt and others have raised that profile.
