{"name": "Frank Gehry", "content": "\n Frank Owen Gehry, CC, FAIA  (/\u02c8\u0261\u025b\u0259ri/; born Frank Owen Goldberg; (1929 -02-28)February 28, 1929)[1] is a Canadian-born American architect and designer, residing in Los Angeles.\n A number of his buildings, including his private residence, have become world-renowned attractions. His works are cited as being among the most important works of contemporary architecture in the 2010 World Architecture Survey, which led Vanity Fair to label him as \"the most important architect of our age\".[2]\n Gehry's best-known works include the titanium-clad Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain; Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles; Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, France; MIT Ray and Maria Stata Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts; the Vontz Center for Molecular Studies on the University of Cincinnati campus; Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle; New World Center in Miami Beach; Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis; Dancing House in Prague; the Vitra Design Museum and the MARTa Herford museum in Germany; the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto; the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise in Paris; and 8 Spruce Street in New York City.\n His private residence in Santa Monica, California, jump-started his career. Gehry is also the designer of the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial.[3]\n Gehry was born Frank Owen Goldberg[1] on February 28, 1929, in Toronto, Ontario, to parents Sadie Thelma (n\u00e9e Kaplanski/Caplan) and Irving Goldberg.[4] His father was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Russian Jewish parents, and his mother was a Polish Jewish immigrant born in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.[5][6][7] A creative child, he was encouraged by his grandmother, Leah Caplan,[8] with whom he would build little cities out of scraps of wood.[9] With these scraps from her husband's hardware store, she entertained him for hours, building imaginary houses and futuristic cities on the living room floor.[4]\n His use of corrugated steel, chain-link fencing, unpainted plywood, and other utilitarian or \"everyday\" materials was partly inspired by spending Saturday mornings at his grandfather's hardware store. He would spend time drawing with his father, while his mother introduced him to the world of art. \"So the creative genes were there\", Gehry says. \"But my father thought I was a dreamer, I wasn't gonna amount to anything. It was my mother who thought I was just reticent to do things. She would push me.\"[10]\n He was given the Hebrew name \"Ephraim\" by his grandfather, but only used it at his bar mitzvah.[1]\n In 1947, his family immigrated to the United States, settling in California. Gehry got a job driving a delivery truck, and studied at Los Angeles City College, eventually to graduate from the University of Southern California's School of Architecture. During that time, he became a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi.[11]\n According to Gehry, \"I was a truck driver in L.A., going to City College, and I tried radio announcing, which I wasn't very good at. I tried chemical engineering, which I wasn't very good at and didn't like, and then I remembered. You know, somehow I just started wracking my brain about, 'What do I like?' Where was I? What made me excited? And I remembered art, that I loved going to museums and I loved looking at paintings, loved listening to music. Those things came from my mother, who took me to concerts and museums. I remembered Grandma and the blocks, and just on a hunch, I tried some architecture classes.\"[12] Gehry graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree from the University of Southern California  in 1954.[13]\n After graduating from college, he spent time away from the field of architecture in numerous other jobs, including service in the United States Army.[9] In the fall of 1956, he moved his family to Cambridge, where he studied city planning at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He left before completing the program, disheartened and underwhelmed.[14] Gehry's left-wing ideas about socially responsible architecture were under-realized,[clarification needed] and the final straw occurred when he sat in on a discussion of one professor's \"secret project in progress\"\u2014a palace that he was designing for right-wing Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista (1901\u20131973).[4]\n Gehry returned to Los Angeles to work for Victor Gruen Associates, to whom he had been apprenticed while at the USC School of Architecture. In 1957 he was given the chance to design his first private residence at the age of 28, with friend and old classmate Greg Walsh. Construction was done by another neighbor across the street from his wife's family, Charlie Sockler. Built in Idyllwild, California, for his wife Anita's family neighbor Melvin David, \"The David Cabin\",[15] shows features that were to become synonymous with later work. The over 2,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (190\u00a0m2) mountain retreat has unique design features with strong Asian influences, stemming from his earliest inspirations at the time like Shosoin Treasure House in Nara, Japan, among others. Beams protrude from the exterior sides, vertical grain douglas fir detail, and exposed, unfinished ceiling beams are prominent features.\n In 1961, he moved to Paris, where he worked for architect Andre Remondet.[16] In 1962, Gehry established a practice in Los Angeles, which became Frank Gehry and Associates in 1967[9] and then Gehry Partners in 2001.[17] Gehry's earliest commissions were all in Southern California, where he designed a number of innovative commercial structures such as Santa Monica Place (1980) and residential buildings such as the eccentric Norton House (1984) in Venice, California.[18]\n Among these works, however, Gehry's most notable design may be the renovation of his own Santa Monica residence.[19] Originally built in 1920 and purchased by Gehry in 1977, the house features a metallic exterior wrapped around the original building that leaves many of the original details visible.[20] Gehry still resides there.\n Other completed buildings designed by Gehry during the 1980s include the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium (1981) in San Pedro and the California Aerospace Museum (1984) at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles.\n In 1989, Gehry was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize. The jury cited Gehry as \"Always open to experimentation, he has as well a sureness and maturity that resists, in the same way that Picasso did, being bound either by critical acceptance or his successes. His buildings are juxtaposed collages of spaces and materials that make users appreciative of both the theatre and the back-stage, simultaneously revealed.\"[21]\n Though Gehry continued to design other notable buildings in California such as the Chiat/Day Building (1991) in Venice in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg, which is well known for its massive sculpture of binoculars, he also began to receive larger national and international commissions. These include Gehry's first European commission, the Vitra International Furniture Manufacturing Facility and Design Museum in Germany completed in 1989. This was soon followed by other major commissions including the Frederick Weisman Museum of Art[22] (1993) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise[23] (1994) in Paris, and the Dancing House[24] (1996) in Prague.\n In 1997, Gehry vaulted to a new level of international acclaim[2] when the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened in Bilbao, Spain. Hailed by The New Yorker as a \"masterpiece of the 20th century\" and legendary architect Philip Johnson as \"the greatest building of our time\",[25] the museum became famous for its striking, yet aesthetically pleasing design and the economic effect that it had on the city.\n Since then, Gehry has regularly won major commissions and has further established himself as one of the world's most notable architects. His best-received works include several concert halls for classical music, such as the boisterous and curvaceous Walt Disney Concert Hall (2003) in downtown Los Angeles, which has been the centerpiece of the neighborhood's revitalization and has been labeled by the Los Angeles Times as \"the most effective answer to doubters, naysayers, and grumbling critics an American architect has ever produced\",[26] the open-air Jay Pritzker Pavilion (2004) in Chicago's Millennium Park,[27] and the understated New World Center (2011) in Miami Beach, which the LA Times called \"a piece of architecture that dares you to underestimate it or write it off at first glance.\"[28]\n Other notable works include academic buildings such as the Stata Center (2004)[29] at MIT and the Peter B. Lewis Library (2008) at Princeton University,[30] museums such as the Museum of Pop Culture (2000) in Seattle, Washington,[31] commercial buildings such as the IAC Building (2007) in New York City,[32] and residential buildings such as Gehry's first skyscraper, the Beekman Tower at 8 Spruce Street (2011)[33] in New York City.\n Several recent and ongoing major works by Gehry around the world include the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building in the University of Technology Sydney, completed in 2014.[34] The Chau Chak Wing, with its 320,000 bricks in \"sweeping lines\" is described as \"10 out of 10\" on a scale of difficulty.[35] An ongoing project is the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi on Saadiyat Island in the United Arab Emirates.[36] Other significant projects such as the Mirvish Towers in Toronto,[37] and a multi-decade renovation of the Philadelphia Museum of Art are currently in the design stage. In October 2013, Gehry was appointed joint architect with Foster + Partners to design the \"High Street\" phase of the development of Battersea Power Station in London, Gehry's first project there.[38]\n However, in recent years, some of Gehry's more prominent designs have failed to go forward. In addition to unrealized designs such as a major Corcoran Art Gallery expansion in Washington, DC, and a new Guggenheim museum near the South Street Seaport in New York City, Gehry was notoriously dropped by developer Bruce Ratner from the Pacific Park (Brooklyn) redevelopment project and was also dropped in 2014 as the designer of the World Trade Center Performing Arts Center, both in New York City.[39] Nevertheless, some stalled projects have recently shown progress: after many years and a dismissal, Gehry was recently reinstated as architect for the Grand Avenue Project in Los Angeles, and though Gehry's controversial[40][41]\n[42] design of the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington, DC, has been subject to numerous delays during the approval process with the United States Congress, the project was finally approved in 2014 with a modified design.\n In 2014, two significant, long-awaited museums designed by Gehry opened: the Biomuseo,[43] a biodiversity museum in Panama City, Panama, and the Fondation Louis Vuitton,[44][45][46] a modern art museum in the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris, France, which opened to some rave reviews.[47]\n Also in 2014, Gehry was commissioned by River LA, formerly known as the Los Angeles River Revitalization Corporation, a nonprofit group founded by the city of Los Angeles in 2009 to coordinate river policy, to devise a wide-ranging new plan for the river.[48][49]\n In February 2015, the new building for the University of Technology Sydney was officially opened, with a fa\u00e7ade constructed from more than 320,000 hand-placed bricks and glass slabs, and costing AU$180\u00a0million. Gehry said he would not design a building like the \"crumpled paper bag\" again.[50]\n Gehry told the French newspaper La Croix in November 2016 that President of France Fran\u00e7ois Hollande had assured the architect that he could relocate to France if Donald Trump was elected President of the United States.[51][52] The following month, Gehry said that he had no plans to move.[53] Trump and he exchanged words in 2010 when Gehry's 8 Spruce Street, originally known as Beekman Tower, was built 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m) taller than the nearby Trump Building, which until then had been New York City's tallest residential building.[52][54]\n Said to \"defy categorisation\", Gehry's work reflects a spirit of experimentation coupled with a respect for the demands of professional practice and has remained largely unaligned with broader stylistic tendencies or movements.[55] With his earliest educational influences rooted in modernism, Gehry's work has sought to escape modernist stylistic tropes while still remaining interested in some of its underlying transformative agendas. Continually working between given circumstances and unanticipated materializations, he has been assessed as someone who \"made us produce buildings that are fun, sculpturally exciting, good experiences\", although his approach may become \"less relevant as pressure mounts to do more with less\".[55]\n Gehry's style at times seems unfinished or even crude, but his work is consistent with the California \"funk\" art movement in the 1960s and early 1970s, which featured the use of inexpensive found objects and nontraditional media such as clay to make serious art.[56] His works always have at least some element of deconstructivism.[57] Gehry has been called \"the apostle of chain-link fencing and corrugated metal siding\".[58] However, a retrospective exhibit at New York's Whitney Museum in 1988 revealed that he is also a sophisticated classical artist, who knows European art history and contemporary sculpture and painting.[56]\n \"El Peix\", fish sculpture located in front of the Port Ol\u00edmpic, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain (1992)\n Dancing House in Prague (1996)\n The Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle (2000)\n Gehry Tower in Hanover, Germany (2001)\n Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio (2002)\n Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles (2003)\n Richard B.

Indeed, over $3.5 billion have been added to the Basque economy since the building opened.[60] In subsequent years there have been many attempts to replicate this effect through large-scale eye-catching architectural commissions that have been both successful and unsuccessful, such as Daniel Libeskind's expansion of the Denver Art Museum and buildings by Gehry himself, such as the almost universally well-received Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the more controversial Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle.[61] Though some link the concept of the Bilbao Effect to the notion of starchitecture, Gehry has consistently rejected the label of a starchitect.[62]\n Though much of Gehry's work has been well-received, its reception was not always positive. Art historian Hal Foster reads Gehry's architecture as, primarily, in the service of corporate branding.[63] Criticism of his work includes complaints over design flaws that the buildings waste structural resources by creating functionless forms, do not seem to belong in their surroundings or enhance the public context of their locations, and are apparently designed without accounting for the local climate.[64][65][66]\n Moreover, socialist magazine Jacobin pointed out that Gehry's work can be summed up as architecture for the super-wealthy, in the sense that it is expensive, not resourceful, and does not serve the interests of the overwhelming majority. The article criticized Gehry's statement, \"In the world we live in, 98 percent of what gets built and designed today is pure shit.\"[67]\n In January 2011, Gehry joined the University of Southern California (USC) faculty, as the Judge Widney Professor of Architecture.[68] He has since continued in this role at his alma mater. In addition to his position at USC, Gehry has held teaching positions at Harvard University, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Toronto, Columbia University, the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, and at Yale University, where he is still teaching as of 2017.[69]\n Though Gehry is often referred to as a \"starchitect\", he has repeatedly expressed his disdain for the term, insisting instead that he is only an architect.[62][70] Steve Sample, President of the University of Southern California, told Gehry that \"...After George Lucas, you are our most prominent graduate\".\n As of December 2013[update], Gehry has received over a dozen honorary degrees from various universities (see #Honorary doctorates).\n In February 2017, MasterClass announced an online architecture course taught by Gehry that was then released in July.[71]\n Gehry has been involved in exhibition designs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art dating back to the 1960s. In 1965, Gehry designed the exhibition display for the \"Art Treasures of Japan\" exhibition at the LACMA. This was followed soon after by the exhibition design for the \"Assyrian Reliefs\" show in 1966 and the \"Billy Al Bengston Retrospective\" in 1968. The LACMA then had Gehry design the installation for the \"Treasures of Tutankhamen\" exhibition in 1978 followed by the \"Avant-Garde in Russia 1910\u20131930\" exhibition in 1980. The subsequent year, Gehry designed the exhibition for \"Seventeen Artists in the '60s\" at the LACMA, followed soon after by the \"German Expressionist Sculpture Exhibition\" in 1983. In 1991/92, Gehry designed the installation of the landmark exhibition \"Degenerate Art: The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany\", which opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and traveled to the Art Institute of Chicago, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, and the Altes Museum in Berlin.[72][73] In 2014, Gehry was asked to design an exhibition on the work of Alexander Calder at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Resnick Pavilion, again invited by the museum's curator Stephanie Barron.[74] The exhibition began on November 24, 2013, and ran through July 27, 2014.\n In addition to his long-standing involvement with exhibition design at the LACMA, Gehry has also designed numerous exhibition installations with other institutions. In 1998, \"The Art of the Motorcycle\" exhibition opened at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum with its installation designed by Gehry. This exhibition subsequently traveled to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Guggenheim Las Vegas.\n In 2014, he curated an exhibition of photography by his close friend and businessman Peter Arnell that ran from March 5 through April 1 at Milk Studios Gallery in Los Angeles.[75]\n In 1983, Gehry created the stage design for Lucinda Childs' dance Available Light, set to music by John Adams. It premiered at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles at the \"Temporary Contemporary\", and was subsequently seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music Opera House in New York City and the Theatre de la Ville in Paris. The set consisted of two levels angled in relation to each other, with a chain-link backdrop.[76] The pieces was revived in 2015,[77] and was performed, among other places, in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, where it was presented by FringeArts, which commissioned the revival.[78]\n In 2012, Gehry designed the set for the Los Angeles Philharmonic's opera production of Don Giovanni, performed at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.\n In April 2014, Gehry designed a set for an \"exploration of the life and career of Pierre Boulez\" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which was performed in November of that year.[79]\n In addition to architecture, Gehry has made a line of furniture, jewelry for Tiffany & Co., various household items, sculptures, and even a glass bottle for Wyborowa Vodka. His first line of furniture, produced from 1969 to 1973, was called \"Easy Edges\", constructed out of cardboard. Another line of furniture released in the spring of 1992 is \"Bentwood Furniture\". Each piece is named after a different hockey term. He was first introduced to making furniture in 1954 while serving in the U.S.\u00a0Army, where he designed furniture for the enlisted soldiers.\n In many of his designs, Gehry is inspired by fish. \"It was by accident I got into the fish image\", claimed Gehry. One thing that sparked his interest in fish was the fact that his colleagues were recreating Greek temples. He said, \"Three hundred million years before man was fish....if you gotta go back, and you're insecure about going forward...go back three hundred million years ago. Why are you stopping at the Greeks? So, I started drawing fish in my sketchbook, and then I started to realize that there was something in it.\"[80]\n As a result of his fascination, the first Fish Lamps were fabricated between 1984 and 1986. They employed wire armatures molded into fish shapes, onto which shards of plastic laminate ColorCore are individually glued. Since the creation of the first lamp in 1984, the fish has become a recurrent motif in Gehry's work, most notably in the Fish Sculpture at La Vila Ol\u00edmpica del Poblenou in Barcelona (1989\u201392) and Standing Glass Fish for the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden (1986).[81]\n Gehry has previously collaborated with luxury jewelry company Tiffany & Co., creating six distinct jewelry collections: the Orchid, Fish, Torque, Equus, Axis, and Fold collections. In addition to jewelry, Gehry designed other items, including a distinctive collector's chess set and a series of tableware items, including vases, cups, and bowls for the company.[82]\n In 2004, Gehry designed the official trophy for the World Cup of Hockey.[83] He redesigned the trophy for the next tournament in 2016.[84]\n In 2014, Gehry was one of the six \"iconoclasts\" selected by French fashion house Louis Vuitton to design a piece using their iconic monogram pattern as part of their \"Celebrating Monogram\" campaign.[85]\n In 2015, Gehry designed his first yacht.[86]\n Gehry's firm was responsible for innovation in architectural software.[87] His firm spun off another firm called Gehry Technologies that was established in 2002. In 2005, Gehry Technologies began a partnership with Dassault Syst\u00e8mes to bring innovations from the aerospace and manufacturing world to AEC and developed Digital Project software, as well as GTeam software. In 2014, Gehry Technologies was acquired by software company Trimble Navigation.[88] Its client list includes Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Herzog & de Meuron, Jean Nouvel, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Zaha Hadid.\n Having grown up in Canada, Gehry is an avid fan of ice hockey. He began a hockey league in his office, FOG (which stands for Frank Owen Gehry), though he no longer plays with them.[89] In 2004, he designed the trophy for the World Cup of Hockey.[90] Gehry is a naturalized U.S. citizen[91] and is also a citizen of Canada.[92] He lives in Santa Monica, California, and continues to practice out of Los Angeles.[93]\n Gehry is known for his sometimes cantankerous personality. During a trip to Oviedo, Spain, to accept the Prince of Asturias Award in October 2014, he received a significant amount of attention, both positive and negative, for publicly flipping off a reporter at a press conference who accused him of being a \"showy\" architect.[94][95]\n Gehry is a member of the California Yacht Club in Marina Del Rey, and enjoys sailing with his fiberglass-hulled yacht, Foggy.[96] Gehry also serves on the Leadership council of The New York Stem Cell Foundation.[97]\n In 2004, he voiced himself on the children's TV\u00a0show Arthur, where he helped Arthur and his friends design a new treehouse.[98] Gehry also voiced himself in the 2005 episode of The Simpsons called \"The Seven-Beer Snitch\", in which he designs a concert hall for the fictional city of Springfield. Gehry has since voiced that he regrets his appearance since a joke about his design technique has led people to misunderstand his architectural process.[99]\n In 2006, filmmaker Sydney Pollack made a documentary about Gehry's work called Sketches of Frank Gehry. The film, which followed Gehry over the course of five years and painted a positive portrait of his character, was well-received critically.[100]\n In 2009, architecturally-inspired ice cream sandwich company Coolhaus named a cookie and ice cream combination after Gehry. Dubbed the \"Frank Behry\", it features Strawberries & Cream gelato and snickerdoodle cookies.[101][102]\n In October 2014, the first major European exhibition of Gehry's work debuted at the Centre Pompidou in Paris.[103] Other museums or major galleries that have done exhibitions on Gehry's architecture or design include the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1983 and the Walker Art Center in 1986, whose exhibition then traveled to the Toronto Harbourfront Museum, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, the LACMA and the Whitney Museum. Subsequently, further museums that have done major exhibitions on Gehry's work include the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in 1992, the Gagosian Gallery in 1984, 1992, and 1993, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2001, the Guggenheim Bilbao in 2002, the Jewish Museum in Manhattan in 2010, and the Milan Triennale, first in 1988 and then in 2010, with an exhibition entitled \"Frank Gehry from 1997\". In 2015, LACMA held a major retrospective of Gehry's work.[104]\n Gehry participated in the 1980 Venice Biennale's La Strada Novissima installation. He also contributed to the 1985 Venice Biennale with an installation and performance named Il Corso del Coltello done in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg. His projects were featured in the 1996 Venice Biennale. He subsequently contributed to the 2008 Venice Biennale with the installation Ungapatchket.\n In October 2015, 21 21 Design Sight in Tokyo held the exhibition Frank Gehry. I Have An Idea, curated by Japanese architect Tsuyoshi Tane.[105]\n Gehry was elected to the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1974, and he has received many national, regional and local AIA awards. He is a senior fellow of the Design Futures Council and serves on the steering committee of the Aga Khan Award for Architecture.\n Notes\n Bibliography\n Further reading\n ", "tags": ["1929 births", "Architects from Los Angeles", "Art in Greater Los Angeles", "20th-century Canadian architects", "Canadian furniture designers", "Canadian emigrants to the United States", "Canadian male voice actors", "Canadian Jews", "Canadian people of Polish-Jewish descent", "Columbia University faculty", "Companions of the Order of Canada", "Deconstructivism", "Harvard Graduate School of Design alumni", "Jewish architects", "Jewish American artists", "Living people", "Members of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts", "National Design Award winners", "Organic architecture", "People from Toronto", "Postmodern architects", "Pritzker Architecture Prize winners", "Recipients of the Praemium Imperiale", "Recipients of the Royal Gold Medal", "United States Army soldiers", "United States National Medal of Arts recipients", "USC School of Architecture alumni", "Wolf Prize in Arts laureates", "Yale School of Architecture faculty", "People associated with the Philadelphia Museum of Art", "Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients", "Honorary Members of the Royal Academy", "American Jews", "American people of Polish-Jewish descent", "20th-century American architects", "21st-century American architects", "21st-century Canadian architects", "American furniture designers", "American male voice actors", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from August 2017", "Use American English from August 2017", "All Wikipedia articles written in American English", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from November 2014", "Articles containing potentially dated statements from December 2013", "All articles containing potentially dated statements", "CS1 maint: extra text: authors list", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with AGSA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NGV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "AC with 26 elements", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Canadian\u2013American architect\n\n\nFrank GehryGehry in 2010BornFrank Owen Goldberg (1929-02-28) February 28, 1929 (age\u00a092)Toronto, Ontario, CanadaNationalityCanadian, AmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Southern CaliforniaOccupationArchitectSpouse(s)Berta Isabel Aguilera (m. 1975)Children4AwardsListPracticeGehry Partners LLPBuildingsList\nWebsitefoga.com\nFrank Owen Gehry, CC, FAIA  (/\u02c8\u0261\u025b\u0259ri/; born Frank Owen Goldberg; (1929 -02-28)February 28, 1929)[1] is a Canadian-born American architect and designer, residing in Los Angeles.\nA number of his buildings, including his private residence, have become world-renowned attractions. His works are cited as being among the most important works of contemporary architecture in the 2010 World Architecture Survey, which led Vanity Fair to label him as \"the most important architect of our age\".[2]\nGehry's best-known works include the titanium-clad Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain; Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles; Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, France; MIT Ray and Maria Stata Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts; the Vontz Center for Molecular Studies on the University of Cincinnati campus; Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle; New World Center in Miami Beach; Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis; Dancing House in Prague; the Vitra Design Museum and the MARTa Herford museum in Germany; the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto; the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise in Paris; and 8 Spruce Street in New York City.\nHis private residence in Santa Monica, California, jump-started his career.

Eisenhower Memorial.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n\n1.1 Education\n\n\n2 Career\n3 Architectural style\n\n3.1 Gallery\n3.2 Bilbao effect\n3.3 Criticism\n\n\n4 Other aspects of career\n\n4.1 Academia\n4.2 Exhibition design\n4.3 Stage design\n4.4 Other designs\n4.5 Software development\n\n\n5 Personal life\n6 In popular culture\n7 Works\n\n7.1 Exhibitions of Gehry's work\n\n\n8 Awards and honors\n\n8.1 Honorary doctorates\n\n\n9 See also\n10 References\n11 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\n Gehry Residence in Santa Monica, California (1978)\nGehry was born Frank Owen Goldberg[1] on February 28, 1929, in Toronto, Ontario, to parents Sadie Thelma (n\u00e9e Kaplanski/Caplan) and Irving Goldberg.[4] His father was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Russian Jewish parents, and his mother was a Polish Jewish immigrant born in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.[5][6][7] A creative child, he was encouraged by his grandmother, Leah Caplan,[8] with whom he would build little cities out of scraps of wood.[9] With these scraps from her husband's hardware store, she entertained him for hours, building imaginary houses and futuristic cities on the living room floor.[4]\nHis use of corrugated steel, chain-link fencing, unpainted plywood, and other utilitarian or \"everyday\" materials was partly inspired by spending Saturday mornings at his grandfather's hardware store. He would spend time drawing with his father, while his mother introduced him to the world of art. \"So the creative genes were there\", Gehry says. \"But my father thought I was a dreamer, I wasn't gonna amount to anything. It was my mother who thought I was just reticent to do things. She would push me.\"[10]\nHe was given the Hebrew name \"Ephraim\" by his grandfather, but only used it at his bar mitzvah.[1]\n\nEducation[edit]\nIn 1947, his family immigrated to the United States, settling in California. Gehry got a job driving a delivery truck, and studied at Los Angeles City College, eventually to graduate from the University of Southern California's School of Architecture. During that time, he became a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi.[11]\nAccording to Gehry, \"I was a truck driver in L.A., going to City College, and I tried radio announcing, which I wasn't very good at. I tried chemical engineering, which I wasn't very good at and didn't like, and then I remembered. You know, somehow I just started wracking my brain about, 'What do I like?' Where was I? What made me excited? And I remembered art, that I loved going to museums and I loved looking at paintings, loved listening to music. Those things came from my mother, who took me to concerts and museums. I remembered Grandma and the blocks, and just on a hunch, I tried some architecture classes.\"[12] Gehry graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree from the University of Southern California  in 1954.[13]\nAfter graduating from college, he spent time away from the field of architecture in numerous other jobs, including service in the United States Army.[9] In the fall of 1956, he moved his family to Cambridge, where he studied city planning at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He left before completing the program, disheartened and underwhelmed.[14] Gehry's left-wing ideas about socially responsible architecture were under-realized,[clarification needed] and the final straw occurred when he sat in on a discussion of one professor's \"secret project in progress\"\u2014a palace that he was designing for right-wing Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista (1901\u20131973).[4]\n\nCareer[edit]\n Chiat/Day Building in Venice, California (1991)\n Part of the roof of the Fondation Louis Vuitton building as seen from the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, France (2016)\n New World Center in Miami Beach, Florida (2011)\n The tower at 8 Spruce Street in Lower Manhattan, completed in February 2011, has a stainless steel and glass exterior and is 76\u00a0stories high (2011)\n The Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health of the Cleveland Clinic in Las Vegas, Nevada (2010)\nGehry returned to Los Angeles to work for Victor Gruen Associates, to whom he had been apprenticed while at the USC School of Architecture. In 1957 he was given the chance to design his first private residence at the age of 28, with friend and old classmate Greg Walsh. Construction was done by another neighbor across the street from his wife's family, Charlie Sockler. Built in Idyllwild, California, for his wife Anita's family neighbor Melvin David, \"The David Cabin\",[15] shows features that were to become synonymous with later work. The over 2,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (190\u00a0m2) mountain retreat has unique design features with strong Asian influences, stemming from his earliest inspirations at the time like Shosoin Treasure House in Nara, Japan, among others. Beams protrude from the exterior sides, vertical grain douglas fir detail, and exposed, unfinished ceiling beams are prominent features.\nIn 1961, he moved to Paris, where he worked for architect Andre Remondet.[16] In 1962, Gehry established a practice in Los Angeles, which became Frank Gehry and Associates in 1967[9] and then Gehry Partners in 2001.[17] Gehry's earliest commissions were all in Southern California, where he designed a number of innovative commercial structures such as Santa Monica Place (1980) and residential buildings such as the eccentric Norton House (1984) in Venice, California.[18]\nAmong these works, however, Gehry's most notable design may be the renovation of his own Santa Monica residence.[19] Originally built in 1920 and purchased by Gehry in 1977, the house features a metallic exterior wrapped around the original building that leaves many of the original details visible.[20] Gehry still resides there.\nOther completed buildings designed by Gehry during the 1980s include the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium (1981) in San Pedro and the California Aerospace Museum (1984) at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles.\nIn 1989, Gehry was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize. The jury cited Gehry as \"Always open to experimentation, he has as well a sureness and maturity that resists, in the same way that Picasso did, being bound either by critical acceptance or his successes. His buildings are juxtaposed collages of spaces and materials that make users appreciative of both the theatre and the back-stage, simultaneously revealed.\"[21]\nThough Gehry continued to design other notable buildings in California such as the Chiat/Day Building (1991) in Venice in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg, which is well known for its massive sculpture of binoculars, he also began to receive larger national and international commissions. These include Gehry's first European commission, the Vitra International Furniture Manufacturing Facility and Design Museum in Germany completed in 1989. This was soon followed by other major commissions including the Frederick Weisman Museum of Art[22] (1993) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise[23] (1994) in Paris, and the Dancing House[24] (1996) in Prague.\nIn 1997, Gehry vaulted to a new level of international acclaim[2] when the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened in Bilbao, Spain. Hailed by The New Yorker as a \"masterpiece of the 20th century\" and legendary architect Philip Johnson as \"the greatest building of our time\",[25] the museum became famous for its striking, yet aesthetically pleasing design and the economic effect that it had on the city.\nSince then, Gehry has regularly won major commissions and has further established himself as one of the world's most notable architects. His best-received works include several concert halls for classical music, such as the boisterous and curvaceous Walt Disney Concert Hall (2003) in downtown Los Angeles, which has been the centerpiece of the neighborhood's revitalization and has been labeled by the Los Angeles Times as \"the most effective answer to doubters, naysayers, and grumbling critics an American architect has ever produced\",[26] the open-air Jay Pritzker Pavilion (2004) in Chicago's Millennium Park,[27] and the understated New World Center (2011) in Miami Beach, which the LA Times called \"a piece of architecture that dares you to underestimate it or write it off at first glance.\"[28]\nOther notable works include academic buildings such as the Stata Center (2004)[29] at MIT and the Peter B. Lewis Library (2008) at Princeton University,[30] museums such as the Museum of Pop Culture (2000) in Seattle, Washington,[31] commercial buildings such as the IAC Building (2007) in New York City,[32] and residential buildings such as Gehry's first skyscraper, the Beekman Tower at 8 Spruce Street (2011)[33] in New York City.\nSeveral recent and ongoing major works by Gehry around the world include the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building in the University of Technology Sydney, completed in 2014.[34] The Chau Chak Wing, with its 320,000 bricks in \"sweeping lines\" is described as \"10 out of 10\" on a scale of difficulty.[35] An ongoing project is the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi on Saadiyat Island in the United Arab Emirates.[36] Other significant projects such as the Mirvish Towers in Toronto,[37] and a multi-decade renovation of the Philadelphia Museum of Art are currently in the design stage. In October 2013, Gehry was appointed joint architect with Foster + Partners to design the \"High Street\" phase of the development of Battersea Power Station in London, Gehry's first project there.[38]\nHowever, in recent years, some of Gehry's more prominent designs have failed to go forward. In addition to unrealized designs such as a major Corcoran Art Gallery expansion in Washington, DC, and a new Guggenheim museum near the South Street Seaport in New York City, Gehry was notoriously dropped by developer Bruce Ratner from the Pacific Park (Brooklyn) redevelopment project and was also dropped in 2014 as the designer of the World Trade Center Performing Arts Center, both in New York City.[39] Nevertheless, some stalled projects have recently shown progress: after many years and a dismissal, Gehry was recently reinstated as architect for the Grand Avenue Project in Los Angeles, and though Gehry's controversial[40][41]\n[42] design of the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington, DC, has been subject to numerous delays during the approval process with the United States Congress, the project was finally approved in 2014 with a modified design.\nIn 2014, two significant, long-awaited museums designed by Gehry opened: the Biomuseo,[43] a biodiversity museum in Panama City, Panama, and the Fondation Louis Vuitton,[44][45][46] a modern art museum in the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris, France, which opened to some rave reviews.[47]\nAlso in 2014, Gehry was commissioned by River LA, formerly known as the Los Angeles River Revitalization Corporation, a nonprofit group founded by the city of Los Angeles in 2009 to coordinate river policy, to devise a wide-ranging new plan for the river.[48][49]\nIn February 2015, the new building for the University of Technology Sydney was officially opened, with a fa\u00e7ade constructed from more than 320,000 hand-placed bricks and glass slabs, and costing AU$180\u00a0million. Gehry said he would not design a building like the \"crumpled paper bag\" again.[50]\nGehry told the French newspaper La Croix in November 2016 that President of France Fran\u00e7ois Hollande had assured the architect that he could relocate to France if Donald Trump was elected President of the United States.[51][52] The following month, Gehry said that he had no plans to move.[53] Trump and he exchanged words in 2010 when Gehry's 8 Spruce Street, originally known as Beekman Tower, was built 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m) taller than the nearby Trump Building, which until then had been New York City's tallest residential building.[52][54]\n\nArchitectural style[edit]\nSaid to \"defy categorisation\", Gehry's work reflects a spirit of experimentation coupled with a respect for the demands of professional practice and has remained largely unaligned with broader stylistic tendencies or movements.[55] With his earliest educational influences rooted in modernism, Gehry's work has sought to escape modernist stylistic tropes while still remaining interested in some of its underlying transformative agendas. Continually working between given circumstances and unanticipated materializations, he has been assessed as someone who \"made us produce buildings that are fun, sculpturally exciting, good experiences\", although his approach may become \"less relevant as pressure mounts to do more with less\".[55]\nGehry's style at times seems unfinished or even crude, but his work is consistent with the California \"funk\" art movement in the 1960s and early 1970s, which featured the use of inexpensive found objects and nontraditional media such as clay to make serious art.[56] His works always have at least some element of deconstructivism.[57] Gehry has been called \"the apostle of chain-link fencing and corrugated metal siding\".[58] However, a retrospective exhibit at New York's Whitney Museum in 1988 revealed that he is also a sophisticated classical artist, who knows European art history and contemporary sculpture and painting.[56]\n\nGallery[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\"El Peix\", fish sculpture located in front of the Port Ol\u00edmpic, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain (1992)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDancing House in Prague (1996)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle (2000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGehry Tower in Hanover, Germany (2001)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio (2002)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles (2003)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard B.

Indeed, over $3.5 billion have been added to the Basque economy since the building opened.[60] In subsequent years there have been many attempts to replicate this effect through large-scale eye-catching architectural commissions that have been both successful and unsuccessful, such as Daniel Libeskind's expansion of the Denver Art Museum and buildings by Gehry himself, such as the almost universally well-received Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the more controversial Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle.[61] Though some link the concept of the Bilbao Effect to the notion of starchitecture, Gehry has consistently rejected the label of a starchitect.[62]\n\nCriticism[edit]\nThough much of Gehry's work has been well-received, its reception was not always positive. Art historian Hal Foster reads Gehry's architecture as, primarily, in the service of corporate branding.[63] Criticism of his work includes complaints over design flaws that the buildings waste structural resources by creating functionless forms, do not seem to belong in their surroundings or enhance the public context of their locations, and are apparently designed without accounting for the local climate.[64][65][66]\nMoreover, socialist magazine Jacobin pointed out that Gehry's work can be summed up as architecture for the super-wealthy, in the sense that it is expensive, not resourceful, and does not serve the interests of the overwhelming majority. The article criticized Gehry's statement, \"In the world we live in, 98 percent of what gets built and designed today is pure shit.\"[67]\n\nOther aspects of career[edit]\nAcademia[edit]\nIn January 2011, Gehry joined the University of Southern California (USC) faculty, as the Judge Widney Professor of Architecture.[68] He has since continued in this role at his alma mater. In addition to his position at USC, Gehry has held teaching positions at Harvard University, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Toronto, Columbia University, the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, and at Yale University, where he is still teaching as of 2017.[69]\nThough Gehry is often referred to as a \"starchitect\", he has repeatedly expressed his disdain for the term, insisting instead that he is only an architect.[62][70] Steve Sample, President of the University of Southern California, told Gehry that \"...After George Lucas, you are our most prominent graduate\".\nAs of December 2013[update], Gehry has received over a dozen honorary degrees from various universities (see #Honorary doctorates).\nIn February 2017, MasterClass announced an online architecture course taught by Gehry that was then released in July.[71]\n\nExhibition design[edit]\nGehry has been involved in exhibition designs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art dating back to the 1960s. In 1965, Gehry designed the exhibition display for the \"Art Treasures of Japan\" exhibition at the LACMA. This was followed soon after by the exhibition design for the \"Assyrian Reliefs\" show in 1966 and the \"Billy Al Bengston Retrospective\" in 1968. The LACMA then had Gehry design the installation for the \"Treasures of Tutankhamen\" exhibition in 1978 followed by the \"Avant-Garde in Russia 1910\u20131930\" exhibition in 1980. The subsequent year, Gehry designed the exhibition for \"Seventeen Artists in the '60s\" at the LACMA, followed soon after by the \"German Expressionist Sculpture Exhibition\" in 1983. In 1991/92, Gehry designed the installation of the landmark exhibition \"Degenerate Art: The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany\", which opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and traveled to the Art Institute of Chicago, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, and the Altes Museum in Berlin.[72][73] In 2014, Gehry was asked to design an exhibition on the work of Alexander Calder at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Resnick Pavilion, again invited by the museum's curator Stephanie Barron.[74] The exhibition began on November 24, 2013, and ran through July 27, 2014.\nIn addition to his long-standing involvement with exhibition design at the LACMA, Gehry has also designed numerous exhibition installations with other institutions. In 1998, \"The Art of the Motorcycle\" exhibition opened at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum with its installation designed by Gehry. This exhibition subsequently traveled to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Guggenheim Las Vegas.\nIn 2014, he curated an exhibition of photography by his close friend and businessman Peter Arnell that ran from March 5 through April 1 at Milk Studios Gallery in Los Angeles.[75]\n\nStage design[edit]\nIn 1983, Gehry created the stage design for Lucinda Childs' dance Available Light, set to music by John Adams. It premiered at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles at the \"Temporary Contemporary\", and was subsequently seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music Opera House in New York City and the Theatre de la Ville in Paris. The set consisted of two levels angled in relation to each other, with a chain-link backdrop.[76] The pieces was revived in 2015,[77] and was performed, among other places, in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, where it was presented by FringeArts, which commissioned the revival.[78]\nIn 2012, Gehry designed the set for the Los Angeles Philharmonic's opera production of Don Giovanni, performed at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.\nIn April 2014, Gehry designed a set for an \"exploration of the life and career of Pierre Boulez\" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which was performed in November of that year.[79]\n\nOther designs[edit]\n Wiggle side chair\nIn addition to architecture, Gehry has made a line of furniture, jewelry for Tiffany & Co., various household items, sculptures, and even a glass bottle for Wyborowa Vodka. His first line of furniture, produced from 1969 to 1973, was called \"Easy Edges\", constructed out of cardboard. Another line of furniture released in the spring of 1992 is \"Bentwood Furniture\". Each piece is named after a different hockey term. He was first introduced to making furniture in 1954 while serving in the U.S.\u00a0Army, where he designed furniture for the enlisted soldiers.\nIn many of his designs, Gehry is inspired by fish. \"It was by accident I got into the fish image\", claimed Gehry. One thing that sparked his interest in fish was the fact that his colleagues were recreating Greek temples. He said, \"Three hundred million years before man was fish....if you gotta go back, and you're insecure about going forward...go back three hundred million years ago. Why are you stopping at the Greeks? So, I started drawing fish in my sketchbook, and then I started to realize that there was something in it.\"[80]\nAs a result of his fascination, the first Fish Lamps were fabricated between 1984 and 1986. They employed wire armatures molded into fish shapes, onto which shards of plastic laminate ColorCore are individually glued. Since the creation of the first lamp in 1984, the fish has become a recurrent motif in Gehry's work, most notably in the Fish Sculpture at La Vila Ol\u00edmpica del Poblenou in Barcelona (1989\u201392) and Standing Glass Fish for the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden (1986).[81]\nGehry has previously collaborated with luxury jewelry company Tiffany & Co., creating six distinct jewelry collections: the Orchid, Fish, Torque, Equus, Axis, and Fold collections. In addition to jewelry, Gehry designed other items, including a distinctive collector's chess set and a series of tableware items, including vases, cups, and bowls for the company.[82]\nIn 2004, Gehry designed the official trophy for the World Cup of Hockey.[83] He redesigned the trophy for the next tournament in 2016.[84]\nIn 2014, Gehry was one of the six \"iconoclasts\" selected by French fashion house Louis Vuitton to design a piece using their iconic monogram pattern as part of their \"Celebrating Monogram\" campaign.[85]\nIn 2015, Gehry designed his first yacht.[86]\n\nSoftware development[edit]\nGehry's firm was responsible for innovation in architectural software.[87] His firm spun off another firm called Gehry Technologies that was established in 2002. In 2005, Gehry Technologies began a partnership with Dassault Syst\u00e8mes to bring innovations from the aerospace and manufacturing world to AEC and developed Digital Project software, as well as GTeam software. In 2014, Gehry Technologies was acquired by software company Trimble Navigation.[88] Its client list includes Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Herzog & de Meuron, Jean Nouvel, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Zaha Hadid.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nHaving grown up in Canada, Gehry is an avid fan of ice hockey. He began a hockey league in his office, FOG (which stands for Frank Owen Gehry), though he no longer plays with them.[89] In 2004, he designed the trophy for the World Cup of Hockey.[90] Gehry is a naturalized U.S. citizen[91] and is also a citizen of Canada.[92] He lives in Santa Monica, California, and continues to practice out of Los Angeles.[93]\nGehry is known for his sometimes cantankerous personality. During a trip to Oviedo, Spain, to accept the Prince of Asturias Award in October 2014, he received a significant amount of attention, both positive and negative, for publicly flipping off a reporter at a press conference who accused him of being a \"showy\" architect.[94][95]\nGehry is a member of the California Yacht Club in Marina Del Rey, and enjoys sailing with his fiberglass-hulled yacht, Foggy.[96] Gehry also serves on the Leadership council of The New York Stem Cell Foundation.[97]\n\nIn popular culture[edit]\nIn 2004, he voiced himself on the children's TV\u00a0show Arthur, where he helped Arthur and his friends design a new treehouse.[98] Gehry also voiced himself in the 2005 episode of The Simpsons called \"The Seven-Beer Snitch\", in which he designs a concert hall for the fictional city of Springfield. Gehry has since voiced that he regrets his appearance since a joke about his design technique has led people to misunderstand his architectural process.[99]\nIn 2006, filmmaker Sydney Pollack made a documentary about Gehry's work called Sketches of Frank Gehry. The film, which followed Gehry over the course of five years and painted a positive portrait of his character, was well-received critically.[100]\nIn 2009, architecturally-inspired ice cream sandwich company Coolhaus named a cookie and ice cream combination after Gehry. Dubbed the \"Frank Behry\", it features Strawberries & Cream gelato and snickerdoodle cookies.[101][102]\n\nWorks[edit]\nMain article: List of works by Frank Gehry\nExhibitions of Gehry's work[edit]\nIn October 2014, the first major European exhibition of Gehry's work debuted at the Centre Pompidou in Paris.[103] Other museums or major galleries that have done exhibitions on Gehry's architecture or design include the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1983 and the Walker Art Center in 1986, whose exhibition then traveled to the Toronto Harbourfront Museum, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, the LACMA and the Whitney Museum. Subsequently, further museums that have done major exhibitions on Gehry's work include the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in 1992, the Gagosian Gallery in 1984, 1992, and 1993, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2001, the Guggenheim Bilbao in 2002, the Jewish Museum in Manhattan in 2010, and the Milan Triennale, first in 1988 and then in 2010, with an exhibition entitled \"Frank Gehry from 1997\". In 2015, LACMA held a major retrospective of Gehry's work.[104]\nGehry participated in the 1980 Venice Biennale's La Strada Novissima installation. He also contributed to the 1985 Venice Biennale with an installation and performance named Il Corso del Coltello done in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg. His projects were featured in the 1996 Venice Biennale. He subsequently contributed to the 2008 Venice Biennale with the installation Ungapatchket.\nIn October 2015, 21 21 Design Sight in Tokyo held the exhibition Frank Gehry. I Have An Idea, curated by Japanese architect Tsuyoshi Tane.[105]\n\nAwards and honors[edit]\n1987: Fellow of American Academy of Arts and Letters\n1988: Elected into the National Academy of Design\n1989: Pritzker Architecture Prize\n1992: Praemium Imperiale\n1994: The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize\n1995: American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award[106]\n1998: National Medal of Arts[107]\n1998: Gold Medal Award, Royal Architectural Institute of Canada\n1999: AIA Gold Medal, American Institute of Architects\n2000: Cooper\u2013Hewitt National Design Award Lifetime Achievement[108]\n2002: Companion of the Order of Canada[109]\n2004: Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service\n2006: Inductee, California Hall of Fame\n2007: Henry C.
