She began working at the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais and at the Talitha School. From 1956 to 1962, she implemented a method of pedagogical renewal in early childhood education, following the Montessori model.[1] As part of that task, she devoted herself to the creation of all necessary materials in the field of mathematical games.\n In October 1962 she founded the Ton i Guida school, working in an area of Barcelona with a need for greater attention, with students who were immigrants and had very poor living conditions. Its techniques differed from those of most schools in Francoist Spain, more closely resembling ones from the Second Republic, and classes were taught in Catalan rather than Spanish. The endeavor got off to a difficult start, especially in regard to financing, but between 1972 and 1975 it had more than 400 students and was considered a model school.[2] Canals was also the creator and member of various associations of teachers and professors, including the \"Per\u00edmetre\" teacher's group.
