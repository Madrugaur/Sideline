{"name": "Dudley Weldon Woodard", "content": "Dudley Weldon Woodard (October 3, 1881 \u2013 July 1, 1965) was an American mathematician and professor, and the second African-American to earn a PhD in Mathematics; the first was Woodard's mentor Elbert Frank Cox, who earned a PhD from Cornell in 1925).\n Born in Galveston, Texas on October 3, 1881, Woodard earned his B.A. degree from at Wilberforce University in Ohio (1903), his B.S. degree (1906) and M.Sc. degree (1907) at the University of Chicago.[1] He taught collegiate mathematics in Tuskegee for many years,[2] until finally he earned his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania (1928).[3] His doctoral thesis was entitled, On Two-Dimensional Analysis Situs with Special Reference to the Jordan Curve Theorem, and was advised by John R. Kline.[4][5]\n During his lifetime, he published three papers. The second of these, The Characterization of the Closed N-Cell in Fundamenta Mathematicae, 13 (1929), is, according to Scott Williams, Professor of Mathematics at the State University of New York-Buffalo, the first paper published in an accredited mathematics journal by an African American.[4][6] He also published a study for the Committee of twelve for the advancement of the interests of the Negro race on Jackson, Mississippi in 1909,[7] a textbook, Practical Arithmetic (1911),[8] and an article on geometry teaching at Tuskegee in 1913.[9]\n Woodard was a respected mathematician, professor and mentor to his students at Howard University in Washington DC, where he established the masters program in mathematics.[10] One of his best known students was William Waldron Schieffelin Claytor, who later took his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania (1933), also under Woodard's former advisor, John R. Kline.\n Woodard retired in 1947, after having become chairman of the mathematics department. He died on July 1, 1965 at his home in Cleveland, Ohio, aged 83.[1][11][12][13][14]\n ", "tags": ["1881 births", "1965 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "African-American mathematicians", "African-American academics", "Howard University faculty", "Wilberforce University alumni", "University of Chicago alumni", "University of Pennsylvania alumni", "People from Galveston, Texas", "Disease-related deaths in Ohio", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nDudley Weldon Woodard (October 3, 1881 \u2013 July 1, 1965) was an American mathematician and professor, and the second African-American to earn a PhD in Mathematics; the first was Woodard's mentor Elbert Frank Cox, who earned a PhD from Cornell in 1925).\n\nBiography[edit]\nBorn in Galveston, Texas on October 3, 1881, Woodard earned his B.A. degree from at Wilberforce University in Ohio (1903), his B.S. degree (1906) and M.Sc. degree (1907) at the University of Chicago.[1] He taught collegiate mathematics in Tuskegee for many years,[2] until finally he earned his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania (1928).[3] His doctoral thesis was entitled, On Two-Dimensional Analysis Situs with Special Reference to the Jordan Curve Theorem, and was advised by John R.
