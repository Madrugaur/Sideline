He received a degree from the medical faculty of the P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter University (today the medical faculty of the Semmelweis University) in 1928. In 1928 he became a pathologist at the 1st Department of Pathology, and in 1932 a surgeon at the 3rd Department of Surgery. In 1938 he went to the U.S.A. First, he worked in a private hospital, but in the same year he became Assistant in Medicine at the University of Chicago as pathologist. He received a Doctor of Philosophy degree from that university in 1943. He became professor of internal medicine specialized in thoracic diseases in 1949. He took a main role in the foundation of the Histochemical Society in 1950.[citation needed] In 1956, G\u00f6m\u00f6ri went to the Palo Alto Medical Center and Medical Research Foundation, where he worked the rest of his life. First he studied the special histological structure of bone, but histochemistry soon became his main field of research, which made him world-famous. He developed the G\u00f6m\u00f6ri trichrome stain and G\u00f6m\u00f6ri methenamine silver stain.\n \n This article about a biologist is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.
