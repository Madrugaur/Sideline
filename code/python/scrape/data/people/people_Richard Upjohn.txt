{"name": "Richard Upjohn", "content": "Richard Upjohn (22 January 1802 \u2013 16 August 1878) was a British-born American architect who emigrated to the United States and became most famous for his Gothic Revival churches. He was partially responsible for launching the movement to such popularity in the United States. Upjohn also did extensive work in and helped to popularize the Italianate style. He was a founder and the first president of the American Institute of Architects. His son, Richard Michell Upjohn, (1828-1903), was also a well-known architect and served as a partner in his continued architectural firm in New York.[1][2]\n Richard Upjohn was born in Shaftesbury, England, where he was apprenticed to a builder and cabinet-maker. He eventually became a master-mechanic. He and his family emigrated to the United States in 1829. They initially settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts and then moved on to Boston in 1833, where he worked in architectural design.[2] He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1836.[3] His first major project was for the entrances to the Boston Common, the town's central park and his first church would be St. John's Episcopal Church in Bangor, Maine. He had relocated to New York City by 1839 where he worked on alterations to the famed Trinity Church on Wall Street in lower Manhattan. The alterations were later abandoned and he was commissioned to design a new church, completed in 1846, and still extant today. He published his extremely influential book, \"Upjohn's rural architecture: Designs, working drawings and specifications for a wooden church, and other rural structures\", in 1852. The designs in this publication were widely used across the country by builders, with many examples remaining.[1]\n Upjohn, along with 13 other architects, co-founded the American Institute of Architects on February 23, 1857. He served as president of that organization from 1857 to 1876, being succeeded by Thomas Ustick Walter, fourth Architect of the Capitol. He went on the design many buildings in a variety of styles. He died at his home in Garrison, New York in 1878. Architectural drawings and papers by Upjohn and other family members are held by the Drawings and Archives Department of the  Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University, in New York City, also by the New York Public Library's Humanities and Social Sciences Library, in the Manuscripts and Archives division, and by the Library of Congress,  Prints & Photographs Division on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C..[2]\n He died on 16 August 1878 in Putnam County, New York of \"softening of the brain\", (Cerebral Softening).[4]\n Upjohn is honored together with Ralph Adams Cram and John LaFarge with a feast day on the liturgical calendar in the current Holy Women, Holy Men (Celebrating the Saints) of the Episcopal Church in the U.S.A. on December 16.\n Some of Upjohn's notable projects include:\n Kingscote in Newport, Rhode Island, completed in 1839\n The Edward King House in Newport, Rhode Island, completed in 1847\n St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Albany, New York, completed in 1859\n All Saint's Memorial Church in Navesink, New Jersey, completed in 1864\n St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Selma, Alabama, completed in 1875\n St. Agnes-by-the-Lake in Algoma, completed in 1879\n St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Staatsburg, New York, (1892)\n Notes\n ", "tags": ["1802 births", "1878 deaths", "Architects from New York City", "Defunct architecture firms based in New York City", "American ecclesiastical architects", "British emigrants to the United States", "Fellows of the American Institute of Architects", "People from Shaftesbury", "Richard Upjohn buildings", "Architects of cathedrals", "English ecclesiastical architects", "Architects of Anglican churches", "Founder of American Institute of Architects", "Presidents of the American Institute of Architects", "19th-century American architects", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "British-born American architect\nRichard UpjohnUpjohn oil portrait circa 1870Born(1802-01-22)22 January 1802Shaftesbury, England, UKDied16 August 1878(1878-08-16) (aged\u00a076)Putnam County, New York, USAOccupationArchitectBuildingsTrinity Church in New York CityThe Edward King House in Newport, Rhode IslandSt. Paul's Cathedral in Buffalo, New York\n\nRichard Upjohn (22 January 1802 \u2013 16 August 1878) was a British-born American architect who emigrated to the United States and became most famous for his Gothic Revival churches.
