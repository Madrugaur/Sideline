{"name": "S. N. Cooke", "content": "\nSamuel Nathaniel Cooke Jr. (26 June 1882[1] \u2013 11 April 1964) was an English architect active in Birmingham, England in the early to mid 20th century. He was almost invariably credited as S. N. Cooke and his later work was carried out under the auspices of his firm S. N. Cooke and Partners.

The design of The Repertory Theatre was particularly influenced by Max Littmann's 1908 K\u00fcnstlertheater in Munich.[2] The Birmingham theatre is still in use, now known as the Old Rep.[3]\n Cooke also designed the city's civic war memorial, the Hall of Memory (1922\u20131925), in collaboration with W.
