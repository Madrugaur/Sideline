{"name": "Henry van de Velde", "content": "\n Kunstgewerbeschule Weimar (1907)\nDeutsche Werkbund Theatre in K\u00f6ln (1914)\n Henry Clemens van de Velde (Dutch:\u00a0[\u0251\u0303\u02c8ri v\u0251nd\u0259\u02c8v\u025bld\u0259]; 3 April 1863 \u2013 15 October 1957)[1] was a Belgian painter, architect, interior designer, and art theorist. Together with Victor Horta and Paul Hankar, he is considered one of the founders of Art Nouveau in Belgium.[2] He worked in Paris with Samuel Bing, the founder of the first gallery of Art Nouveau in Paris. Van de Velde spent the most important part of his career in Germany and became a major figure in the German Jugendstil. He had a decisive influence on German architecture and design at the beginning of the 20th century.\n Van de Velde was born in Antwerp, where he studied painting under Charles Verlat at the famous Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Antwerp. He then went on to study with the painter Carolus-Duran in Paris. As a young painter he was strongly influenced by Paul Signac and Georges Seurat and soon adopted a neo-impressionist style, and pointillism. In 1889 he became a member of the Brussels-based artist group \"Les XX\". After Vincent van Gogh exhibited some work on the yearly exhibition of Les XX van de Velde became one of the first artists to be influenced by the Dutch painter. During this period he developed a lasting friendship with the painter Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe and the sculptor Constantin Meunier.\n In 1890, van de Velde wrote that \"there will be no place in the society of the future for anything which is not of use to everyone.\"[2]\n In 1892, he abandoned painting, devoting his time to the arts of decoration and interior design (silver and goldsmith's trade, chinaware and cutlery, fashion design, carpet and fabric design). His meeting with Maria S\u00e8the, his future wife, was instrumental in this change.[3] They collaborated on a number of projects together, including designing wallpapers and female clothing.[4] Their first house, Bloemenwerf in Ukkel, was van de Velde's first attempt at architecture and was inspired by the British Arts and Crafts Movement. Its exterior closely resembled the Red House of William Morris. Maria S\u00e8the designed the garden surrounding the house.[5]\n Henry van de Velde also designed interiors and furniture for the influential art gallery \"L'Art Nouveau\" of Samuel Bing in Paris in 1895. the shop from which Art Nouveau took its name. He participated in Bing's pavilion at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900 and showed his own work. Van de Velde was strongly influenced by John Ruskin and William Morris's English Arts and Crafts movement[2] and he was one of the first architects or furniture designers to apply curved lines in an abstract style, rather than based on nature.\n Van de Velde's design work became known in Germany through periodicals such as Innen-Dekoration. As a result, he received commissions for interior designs in Berlin. Around the turn of the century, he designed Villa Leuring in the Netherlands, and Villa Esche in Chemnitz, two works that show his Art Nouveau style in architecture. He also designed the interior of the Folkwang Museum in Hagen (today the building houses the Karl Ernst Osthaus-Museum) and the Nietzsche Archive in Weimar.\n In 1899,[citation needed] he settled in Weimar, Germany, where he was employed as artistic advisor to William Ernest, Grand Duke Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. In 1907, he established the Grand-Ducal School of Arts and Crafts, under the patronage of the Grand Duke. Van de Velde designed the school's building and was the school's first director. He stepped down during World War I due to his Belgian citizenship and suggested that architect Walter Gropius succeed him. In 1919, the School merged with the Weimar Art Academy to form the famous modernist art school, Bauhaus.[2]\n Although a Belgian, van de Velde played an important role in the German Jugendstil.\n In 1907, he co-founded the German Werkbund, an association to help improve and promote German design by establishing close relations between industry and designers.[2] He would oppose Hermann Muthesius at the Werkbund meeting of 1914 and their debate would mark the history of Modern Architecture. Van de Velde called for the upholding of the individuality of artists while Hermann Muthesius called for standardization as a key to development.[citation needed] Van de Velde was a proponent of incorporating logic into all facets of design, taking inspiration from engineers application of reason and calculation.[2]\n During World War I, Van de Velde, as a foreign national, was obliged to leave Weimar (although on good terms with the Weimar government) and returned to his native Belgium. Later, he lived in Switzerland and in the Netherlands where he designed the Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum in Otterlo. In 1925 he was appointed professor at the Ghent University Institute of Art History and Archaeology, where he lectured architecture and applied arts from 1926 to 1936. He was instrumental in founding in Brussels, in 1926, today's renowned architecture and visual arts school La Cambre, under the name of \"Institut sup\u00e9rieur des Arts d\u00e9coratifs.\"\n He continued his practice in architecture and design, which had demarcated itself significantly from the Art Nouveau phase, whose popularity was by 1910 in decline. During this period, he mentored the great Belgian architect, Victor Bourgeois. In 1933 he was commissioned to design the new building for the university library (the renowned Boekentoren). Construction started in 1936, but the work would not be completed until the end of the Second World War. For budget reasons, the eventual construction did not entirely match the original design. For instance, the reading room floor was executed in marble instead of the black rubber Van de Velde originally intended. He was also involved in the construction of the Ghent University Hospital.\n He died, aged 94, in Z\u00fcrich.\n 12 October 2005 a teapot designed by van de Velde made \u20ac170,000 at a public auction at the Brussels Beaux-Arts auction house \u2013 eleven times the opening bid.  It is a teapot on a chafing dish, with a wooden handle, resting on an oval basis and made of silver-plated brass.  During an Art Nouveau and Design exhibition at the Brussels Cinquantenaire Museum (\"Jubilee Park Museum\") in 2005, Henry van de Velde's tea set, two china plates and a silver dish were badly damaged in an unfortunate accident. The silver candle stand remained unharmed. The pieces had been given on temporary loan by Krefeld's Kaiser Wilhelm Museum, the Museum f\u00fcr Angewandte Kunst in Cologne and a private collector.\n Leidenschaft, Funktion und Sch\u00f6nheit: Henry van de Velde und sein Beitrag zur europ\u00e4ischen Moderne, Neues Museum Weimar, 24 March \u2013 23 June 2013.\n Der Architekt Henry van de Velde, Bauhaus Universit\u00e4t Weimar, 29 March \u2013 12 May 2013.\n Villa Hohenhof in Hagen\n Villa Schulenburg in Gera\n Chemnitz, Germany: Villa Esche\n Staircase of the Sanatorium of Trzebiech\u00f3w\n Extension to the Nietzsche Archiv in Weimar\n Van-de-Velde-Building in Weimar, home of the art faculty of the Bauhaus-University\n Henry van de Velde by Edvard Munch.\n \"Wolfers House\" in Ixelles (Brussels), Belgium\n Monument Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Merode in Brussels, Belgium\n ", "tags": ["1863 births", "1957 deaths", "People from Antwerp", "Flemish painters", "Flemish architects", "Art Nouveau architects", "Arts and Crafts movement", "Expressionist architects", "Modernist architects", "Art Nouveau designers", "Art Nouveau painters", "Henry van de Velde buildings", "1939 New York World's Fair artists", "Bauhaus University, Weimar faculty", "Articles needing additional references from August 2016", "All articles needing additional references", "Use dmy dates from June 2020", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from January 2020", "Articles containing French-language text", "Commons link is on Wikidata", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "CS1 Dutch-language sources (nl)", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from January 2020", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SIKART identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with suppressed authority control identifiers"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.
