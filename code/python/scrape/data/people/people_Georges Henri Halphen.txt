{"name": "Georges Henri Halphen", "content": "Georges-Henri Halphen (French:\u00a0[\u0292\u0254\u0280\u0292 \u0251\u0303\u0281i alf\u025bn]; 30 October 1844, Rouen \u2013 23 May 1889, Versailles) was a French mathematician. He was known for his work in geometry, particularly in enumerative geometry and the singularity theory of algebraic curves, in algebraic geometry. He also worked on invariant theory and projective differential geometry.[1][2]\n He did his studies at \u00c9cole Polytechnique (X 1862), where he graduated in 1866. He continued his education at \u00c9cole d'Application de l'Artillerie et du G\u00e9nie de Metz. As a lieutenant of Artillery he was sent Auxonne first and then to Strasbourg.[2] In 1872, Halphen settled in Paris, where he became a lecturer at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique and began his scientific studies. He completed his dissertation in 1878.[3] In 1872 he married Rose Marguerite Aron, with whom he had eight children, four sons and four daughters. Of the four sons, three joined the military and two of them died in World War I. Louis Halphen (1880-1950) was a French historian specialized in medivial times; Charles Halphen (1885-1915), was deputy secretary of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 math\u00e9matique de France. One of his grandsons was \u00c9tienne Halphen (1911\u20131954), who did significant work in applied statistics.[4]\n Georges-Henri Halphen received in the Steiner prize of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1880 along with Max Noether. In 1881 Halphen received the Grand Prix of the  Acad\u00e9mie des sciences for his work on linear differential equations: M\u00e9moire sur la Reduction des Equations Diff\u00e9rentielles Lin\u00e9aires aux Formes Int\u00e9grales.[5] He received the Prix Poncelet in 1883[6][7] and the Prix Petit d'Ormoy in 1885.[8] He was elected to  the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences in 1886 in the Section de G\u00e9om\u00e9trie, replacing the deceased Jean Claude Bouquet.[2] In 1887 Halphen was elected to the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome.[9]\n An overview of Halphen's work is provided by Laurent Gruson[13] and a complete list of the works was compiled by Camille Jordan as part of Halphen's obituary in Journal de Math\u00e9matiques Pures et Appliqu\u00e9es.[14]\n \n This article about a French mathematician is a stub.
