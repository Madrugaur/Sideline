He studied at the University of Berlin with Karl Weierstrass, where he taught mathematics and physics (1860\u201364). He taught at the University of Greifswald (assistant professor, 1864\u201366; professor, 1866\u201369), the University of Heidelberg (1869\u201375), the Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden (1875-77), and the University of Vienna (1877\u201384) before returning to Heidelberg in 1884, where remained until his retirement in 1914.[3]\n In 1904 he was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in Heidelberg.[4] In 1919 he published his autobiography, Mein Leben (My Life).
