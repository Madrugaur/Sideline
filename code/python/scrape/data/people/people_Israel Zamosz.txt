{"name": "Israel Zamosz", "content": "Israel ben Moses ha-Levi Zamosz (c. 1700, Buberki \u2013 April 20, 1772, Brody) was an eighteenth-century Talmudist, mathematician and poet.[1]\n He was born in Buberki to an undistinguished family and studied in Zamosz, where he also taught at a yeshiva. At the same time he occupied himself with the study of secular sciences, particularly with mathematics, and while there wrote many notes on the Yesod Olam of Isaac Israeli ben Joseph and on the Elim of Joseph Delmedigo. During his residence at Zamosz he also wrote his Arubbot ha-Shamayim, a work on descriptive geometry and astronomy. Zamosz first gained fame with the publication of his Ne\u1e93a\u1e25 Yisrael in 1741, which took the form of a traditional text discussing topics addressed in the Talmud, but innovated by interpreting numerous passages from a mathematical and astronomical viewpoint.[2]\n About 1742, after he had published his Ne\u1e93a\u1e25 Yisrael, Zamosz settled in Berlin, where he remained several years, living in poverty. There he instructed Aaron Solomon Gumperz and Moses Mendelssohn in mathematics and logic, and his scholarship was much appreciated by Lessing.\n Zamosz was a versatile writer, his knowledge comprising rabbinics, religious philosophy, and secular sciences. The only works of his published during his lifetime were the Ne\u1e93a\u1e25 Yisrael (1741) and his edition of the Rua\u1e25 \u1e24en of Ibn Tibbon or Jacob Anatoli, to which he appended a commentary of his own (1744). After his death appeared the Nezer ha-Dema (1773), a work in poetical prose on man's desire for luxury, the O\u1e93ar Ne\u1e25mad (1796), a commentary on the Kuzari, and the \u1e6cub ha-Lebanon (1809), a commentary on the \u1e24obot ha-Lebabot.\n ", "tags": ["1772 deaths", "18th-century rabbis", "18th-century mathematicians", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia without a Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers", "Year of birth uncertain"], "raw": "Israel ben Moses ha-Levi Zamosz (c. 1700, Buberki \u2013 April 20, 1772, Brody) was an eighteenth-century Talmudist, mathematician and poet.[1]\n\nBiography[edit]\nHe was born in Buberki to an undistinguished family and studied in Zamosz, where he also taught at a yeshiva.
