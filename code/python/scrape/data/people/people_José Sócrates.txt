{"name": "Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates", "content": "\n Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates Carvalho Pinto de Sousa, GCIH (born 6 September 1957), commonly known as Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates (Portuguese pronunciation:\u00a0[\u0292u\u02c8z\u025b \u02c8s\u0254k\u027e\u0250t\u0268\u0283]), is a Portuguese politician who was the Prime Minister of Portugal from 12 March 2005 to 21 June 2011. For the second half of 2007, he acted as the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union.\n S\u00f3crates grew up in the industrial city of Covilh\u00e3. He joined the centre-left Socialist Party in 1981 and was elected Member of Parliament in 1987. S\u00f3crates entered the government in 1995, as Secretary of State for Environment in the first cabinet of Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Two years later, he became Minister of Youth and Sports (where he helped to organize Portugal's successful bid to host UEFA Euro 2004) and in 1999 became Minister for Environment. S\u00f3crates prominence rose during the governments of Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to the point that when the Prime Minister resigned in 2001, he considered to appoint S\u00f3crates as his successor.[1]\n In opposition, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was elected leader of the Socialist Party in 2004 and led the party to its first absolute majority in the 2005 election. By then, Portugal was living an economic crisis, marked by stagnation and a difficult state of public finances. Like the preceding centre-right government, S\u00f3crates implemented a policy of fiscal austerity and structural reforms.[2][3] Among the most important reforms were the 2007 Social Security reform and the 2009 labour law reform.[4][5] His government also restructured the provision of public services, closing thousands of elementary schools[6] and dozens of health care facilities and maternity wards in rural areas and small cities.[7][8] Despite austerity, S\u00f3crates's government intended to boost economic growth through government-sponsored investments, namely in transportation, technology and energy as well as in health and school infrastructure. The government launched several public-private partnerships to finance such projects. Internally, S\u00f3crates was accused of having an authoritarian style and of trying to control media,[9] while internationally he completed the negotiations of Lisbon Treaty[10] and had close ties with leaders such as the Prime Minister of Spain Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodriguez Zapatero[11] and the President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez.[12] The first S\u00f3crates government was initially able to reduce the budget deficit[13] and controlling public debt,[14] but economic growth lagged.[15]\n In 2008\u201309, with the Great Recession starting to hit Portugal and facing recession and high unemployment,[16] austerity was waned as part of the European economic stimulus plan.[17] Nevertheless, support for S\u00f3crates and the Socialists eroded and the ruling party lost its majority in the 2009 election.[16] The second government of Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates faced a deterioration of the economic and financial state of the country, with skyrocketing deficit and growing debt.[16] Austerity was resumed in 2010 while the country entered a hard financial crisis in the context of the European debt crisis.[18]\n On 23 March 2011, S\u00f3crates submitted his resignation to President An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva after the Parliament rejected a new austerity package (the fourth in a year), leading to the 2011 snap election. Financial status of the country deteriorated and on 6 April S\u00f3crates caretaker government requested a bail-out program which was conceded. The \u20ac78 billion IMF/European Union bailout to Portugal thus started and would last until May 2014. S\u00f3crates lost the snap election held on 5 June 2011 and resigned as Secretary-General of the Socialist Party.[19] For most of his political career, S\u00f3crates was associated to several corruption cases, notably Independente University and Freeport cases.[9]\n On 21 November 2014 he was arrested in Lisbon, accused of corruption, tax evasion, and money laundering, becoming the first former Prime Minister in the history of the country to be thus accused.[20][21][22] On 24 November S\u00f3crates was remanded in custody on preliminary charges of corruption and tax fraud.[23][24] He was held in \u00c9vora prison until 4 September 2015 when he left the prison for a relative's house in Lisbon, where he remained under house arrest until 16 October 2015.[25][26] That day, a judge released him from house arrest, allowing him to await the end of the investigation in freedom, although remaining forbidden of leaving the country and of contacting with other suspects of the case.[27][28] The police investigation, known as Operation Marquis continued until his indictment in October 2017. In 2018, S\u00f3crates abandoned the Socialist Party.\n Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was born in Porto on 6 September 1957, and was registered as a newborn in Vilar de Ma\u00e7ada, Alij\u00f3 municipality, in northeastern Portugal, since the locality was his family ancestral homeland. However, the young Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates lived throughout his childhood and teen years with his father, a divorced building designer, in the city of Covilh\u00e3, Cova da Beira subregion, in central inland Portugal, in the Centro region. His parents are Fernando Pinto de Sousa (Vilar de Ma\u00e7ada, Alij\u00f3, 15 November 1926 \u2013 Oporto, 18 July 2011)[29] and wife and remote relative Maria Adelaide de Carvalho Monteiro (b. Vilar de Ma\u00e7ada, Alij\u00f3, 8 October 1931). He has two younger siblings, Ant\u00f3nio Carvalho Pinto de Sousa, born circa 1962, and Ana Maria Carvalho Pinto de Sousa, died in 1988. He is a descendant of the illegitimate daughter of Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Gir\u00e3o Teixeira Lobo Barbosa (Porto, S\u00e9, 9 January 1715 \u2013 Alij\u00f3, Vilar de Ma\u00e7ada), Fidalgo of the Royal Household and Knight of the Order of Christ.[30]\n Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates studied in Covilh\u00e3's basic and secondary schools, until the age of 18. Then, in 1975, he went to Coimbra in order to attend a higher education institution. He earned in 1979 his 4-year bacharelato[31] degree as a civil technical engineer from the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra (in 1988 incorporated into the Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Coimbra). From 1987 to 1993, he took law classes at Universidade Lus\u00edada, a private university in Lisbon, but failed to graduate.[32] In 1994/95, already a well-known politician, he briefly attended the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa where he completed some academic disciplines in order to get a CESE diploma (a complementary diploma to his bacharelato degree because until 1999 the polytechnic institutions did not offer licenciatura degrees), but instead, under circumstances which would provoke a controversy in 2007, he earned in 1996 the licenciatura (licentiate degree) in civil engineering from the Universidade Independente, a private university in Lisbon which was shut down by Portuguese authorities in 2007/2008.[33] He also has an MBA degree awarded in 2005 by ISCTE, a public university institute in Lisbon, that he obtained after had attended successfully the first year of a 2-year master's degree program of ISCTE that he did not complete.[34] After his tenure as Prime Minister of Portugal ended in 2011, S\u00f3crates and his elder son, moved to Paris where S\u00f3crates attended the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris (known as SciencesPo).[35] In 2013, SciencesPo awarded him his master's degree in political science.[36] His 2013 book Confian\u00e7a do Mundo - Sobre a Tortura Em Democracia[37] was based on his masters thesis there;[36] however, there was some dispute as to its authorship.[38][39]\n Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was one of the founders of JSD (the youth branch of PSD \u2013 Portuguese Social Democratic Party) before changing his political affiliation and applying for membership in the PS \u2013 Portuguese Socialist Party. He has been a member of the Socialist Party since 1981. Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates served as a technical engineer for the Covilh\u00e3 City Council, and has been elected a member of the Portuguese Parliament since 1987, representing the Castelo Branco electoral district. While serving as the chairperson of the Castelo Branco Federation of the Socialist Party (1983\u20131996), he was elected to the Party's National Secretariat in 1991. Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was ousted by the Board of the Guarda Municipality in 1990 and 1991, after being warned several times because of poor quality of construction projects and lack of monitoring of the construction works. S\u00f3crates was threatened with disciplinary action for wrongdoings in the technical direction of particular works of whose projects he was the author, but despite being ousted from this capacity, he was never penalized. In addition, as a Member of the Parliament, S\u00f3crates was not allowed by law to work as a technical engineer between 1987 and 1991.[40] From 1989 to 1996, he served as a member of the Covilh\u00e3 Municipal Assembly. He served as spokesperson on environmental affairs for the Socialist Party from 1991 to 1995. In 1995, he entered government as secretary of state for Environment in the first government of Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Two years later, S\u00f3crates became Minister for Youth and Sports and was one of the organizers of the EURO 2004 cup in Portugal. He became Minister for Environment in Guterres' second government in 1999. Following the elections of 2002 (won by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso), S\u00f3crates became a member of the opposition in the Portuguese Parliament. Meanwhile, he also had a program of political analysis, hosted jointly with Pedro Santana Lopes on RTP. After the resignation of Ferro Rodrigues as party leader in 2004, he won a bid for the post of secretary-general against Manuel Alegre and Jo\u00e3o Soares, winning the vote of nearly 80% of party members on 24 September 2004. After the victory of his party in the 2005 Portuguese election, S\u00f3crates was called on 24 February by president Jorge Sampaio to form a new government \u2013 the 17th Constitutional Government (after 1976). After the Portuguese legislative election of 2009, held on 27 September 2009, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was elected for a second term as Prime Minister of Portugal. He was also a Member of the Portuguese Council of State as the Prime-Minister.\n S\u00f3crates is divorced from Sofia Costa Pinto Fava,[41] an engineer, with whom he has two sons, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Fava Pinto de Sousa (b. 1993) and Eduardo Fava Pinto de Sousa (b. 1995). Sofia is a daughter of Jos\u00e9 Manuel Carvalho Fava, an architect, and Clotilde Mesquita (daughter of Armando Mesquita and Palmira da Costa Pinto), engineer and sister of Alexandre Mesquita Carvalho Fava and Mara Mesquita Carvalho Fava. S\u00f3crates lives in Lisbon, although he used to be a registered elector of the municipality of Covilh\u00e3, the place where he voted until the law was changed (since after the mid-2000s every person votes in one's residential area).\n Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates had photos of himself taken during his morning jog at places like the Red Square in Moscow, Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana, Luanda, and Lisbon. In January 2008, a smoking ban came into force in Portugal's public buildings and on public transport, but S\u00f3crates was reported to have been smoking in May during a private state flight to Venezuela where he met Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. He has since admitted it was a mistake, apologized and promised to quit smoking. In addition, he claimed he was not aware he was breaking the law when he did so.[42] However, by 2012, after he had left the spotlight, the Portuguese newspaper Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias reported he was no longer a non-smoker.[43]\n After the Portuguese legislative election of 2005, S\u00f3crates was called on 24 February by president Jorge Sampaio to form a new government. S\u00f3crates and his first government (XVII Governo Constitucional) took office on 12 March 2005.\n After the Portuguese legislative election of 2009, held on 27 September 2009, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was elected for a second term as Prime Minister of Portugal. The new government was sworn into office on 26 October 2009.\n On 5 June 2011, after the Portuguese legislative election of 2011, the victory of Social Democratic Party (Portuguese: Partido Social Democrata) led by Pedro Passos Coelho, forced his resignation as Secretary-General of the Socialist Party.\n S\u00f3crates headed the government beginning on 12 March 2005, comprising the XVII and XVIII Governos Constitucionais (17th and 18th Constitutional Governments).\n The XVII Governo Constitucional government, headed by Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, tried to create new rules and implement reforms aiming at better efficiency and rationalized resource allocation in the public sector, fighting civil servant overcapacity (excedent\u00e1rios) and reducing bureaucracy for both citizens and companies (e.g.: empresa na hora,[44] PRACE \u2013 Programa de Reestrutura\u00e7\u00e3o da Administra\u00e7\u00e3o Central do Estado,[45] and SIMPLEX \u2013 Programa de Simplifica\u00e7\u00e3o Administrativa e Legislativa),[46] among others. Since the XVII Governo Constitucional government (with Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates as Prime Minister and Teixeira dos Santos as Minister of Finance) Portugal's fiscal policy improved with a steady increase of the number of taxpayers and the growth of the receipt amount from State taxation. However these policies had little effect, and the country's public debt and deficit were both out of control by 2010, along with a record high unemployment rate. Jo\u00e3o Bilhim directed in 2005 the committee responsible for the Programme for Restructuring the State's Central Administration (PRACE) but was said to be disappointed with the results.[47] Several reforms and measures implemented in 2006/2007 by the government (XVII Governo Constitucional \u2013 headed by Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates), resulted in improved welfare system financial sustainability but reduced income expectations of future pensioners up to 40%.[48] In addition, economically active people must work for more years before retirement than formerly.[49] A sustainability factor was also introduced, giving employees the option of working longer or receiving slightly lower pensions, as life expectancy forecasts increase. After the Portuguese regionalization referendum of 1998 where the \"No\" to regionalization of the mainland into eight administrative regions was victorious, the XVII Governo Constitucional government announced in January 2009[50] its firm intention of starting again a regionalization process for Portugal. According to this governmental project, mainland Portugal was to be regionalized into five regions with a wide range of administrative autonomy, using the already established NUTS II system: Alentejo, Algarve, Lisbon and Tagus Valley, Central Portugal and Northern Portugal. The transformation of the Portuguese public administration from a traditional one to an information technology-based multiplatform service, was praised by the European Commission through its European Union benchmark for the sector, that consecutively placed Portugal in the first position of the ranking in 2009 and 2010.[51]\n One of the government's main policies was the Plano Tecnol\u00f3gico (Technological Plan), aimed at increasing Portugal's competitivity through the modernization of its economy. The plan consisted of three key areas: knowledge, technology and innovation.[52] A low-cost Intel-based netbook for use by children announced by S\u00f3crates's government cabinet, named Magalh\u00e3es (after Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es) and packaged and assembled for the Portuguese school-age children and the low-to-middle income economy export market by the Portuguese company J.P. S\u00e1 Couto, headquartered in Matosinhos, Norte region, was among the government's innovations under the Technological Plan. Governmental efforts in the technological domain also included state support of a Portuguese factory that was owned by the German-based semiconductor company Qimonda AG, in Vila do Conde, Norte region, when the parent company filed a bankruptcy petition with the local court in Munich, Germany, in early 2009. Qimonda Portugal was at the time one of the top Portuguese net exporters of technology.[53]\n The European Innovation Scoreboard of 2010 placed Portugal-based innovation in 15th position, as a result of an impressive increase in innovation expenditure and output.[54]\n The government allocated more resources for education policy and reorganised the sector aiming more choice and better quality in vocational technical education. Enhanced and improved vocational technical education programs were implemented in 2007 in an effort to revitalize this sector which had been almost discontinued after the Carnation Revolution of 1974. Other education reforms included more financial support for students (in all educational levels), systematic teaching and school evaluation, the compulsory closing of some problematic and unreliable private higher education institutions (like the Independente University and Moderna University) by the Minister for Science, Technology and Higher Education, Mariano Gago, and a will to rank and benchmark the higher education institutions through a newly created state-run agency (the Ag\u00eancia de Acredita\u00e7\u00e3o e Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do Ensino Superior). During the XVII Governo Constitucional, the pan-European Bologna Process was fully implemented in Portugal.\n On the other hand, the government created a policy of certification and equivalence of qualifications for adult people with low levels of formal education who want a 4th, 6th, 9th or 12th grade equivalence without returning to school (for example, through this process, called Novas Oportunidades,[55][56] adults\u201418 years old and older\u2014with the 9th grade might be granted an equivalence to the 12th grade after a process ranging from a part-time 3-month programme or a 1-day-per-week 8-month programme; those who have less than 9th grade have a similar programme to get the 9th grade certification and can then apply to the 12th grade programme). The curricula do not include any classical high school discipline or a traditional examination process. These diplomas are awarded based on vaguely construed life experience. Some critics alleged this policy was an effort to make up the poor national statistical indicators on education, with little impact on the quality of the work force's qualification of Portugal in the European Union context.[57][58][59]\n According to the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the average Portuguese 15-year-old student was for many years underrated and underachieving in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge in the OECD, nearly tied with the Italian and just above those from countries like Greece, Turkey and Mexico. However, since 2010, PISA results for Portuguese students improved dramatically. The PISA 2009 report states that the average Portuguese 15-year-old student, when rated in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge, is placed at the same level as those students from the United States, Sweden, Germany, Ireland, France, Denmark, United Kingdom, Hungary and Taipei, with 489 points (493 is the average).[60] However, a couple of weeks later, the Portuguese Ministry of Education announced a 2010 report published by its office for educational evaluation GAVE (Gabinete de Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o) which criticized the results of PISA 2009 report and claimed that the average Portuguese teenage student had profound handicaps in terms of expression, communication and logic, as well as a low performance when asked to solve problems.[61]\n Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates and his government team supported the decision of building new transportation infrastructure such as a new airport for Lisbon and a high speed rail network. For months the government of Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates insisted the country's only option for a new airport was in the Ota region north of Lisbon. But a powerful lobby, headed by local business honchos and given the imprimatur of the Portuguese president An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, forced S\u00f3crates's Government into reversal, by bringing an alternative site for the new airport \u2013 the Portuguese Air Force's shooting range in Alcochete east of Lisbon. A study commissioned by a group of businesspeople said the Alcochete site would save taxpayers as much as \u20ac3bn in construction costs, and would have less of an environmental impact. The government argued that Ota was a key piece of its overall transport strategy, which included highspeed rail lines to Spain, but even so recognized that the project wasn't finalized and that a debate on the pros and cons of both sites would be worthwhile. Then the government commissioned a technical study to the state-run civil engineering laboratory (Portuguese: Laborat\u00f3rio Nacional de Engenharia Civil) comparing both locations one to each other. Following the conclusions of that study, on 10 January 2008 the Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates announced the option Alcochete as the most rational choice for a new airport for Lisbon.\n In 2007, the XVII Governo Constitucional, headed by Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, legalised abortion in Portugal after a referendum. Voters were being asked to decide whether to make abortion legal in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, if carried out at the woman's request in a registered clinic. Despite the turnout for a referendum being too low (40%; 50% needed) to be legally binding, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates said: \"Our interest is to fight clandestine abortion and we have to produce a law that respects the result of the referendum.\"[62] This socialist government cabinet also announced its intention to legalize same-sex marriage at some point during its mandate. Same-sex marriage in Portugal was legalized on 17 May 2010.\n Also, in 2009, through the Decree-Law 91/2009, the rights of fathers and mothers were equalled under the law (see also Fathers' rights).\n After a sharp increase of the violent crime rate in Portugal during the XVII Governo Constitucional government (2005\u20132009), the Minister of Internal Administration Rui Pereira announced in February 2009 the expansion of the police force through the recruitment of 2,000 new police officers, 7,000 new state-of-the-art police weapons, 1,000 bulletproof vests, among other measures.[63]\n Until 2010, for stock held for more than twelve months the capital gain was exempt. The capital gain of stock held for shorter periods of time was taxable on 10%. From 2010 onwards, for residents, all capital gain of stock and other assets above \u20ac500 is taxable on 20%. Investment funds, banks and corporations are in general exempted of capital gain tax over stock.\n Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, as Prime Minister of Portugal, presided over the rotative Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the period July\u2013December 2007.[64] In this post, S\u00f3crates and his team focused on the EU-Brazil (1st EU-Brazil summit) and EU-African Union (2007 Africa-EU Summit) relations, as well as in the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Portuguese Parliament voted to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon on 23 April 2008. After the Irish referendum on 12 June 2008, Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates said he saw the Irish \"No\" to the treaty as a \"personal defeat\" after it was signed by EU leaders in the Portuguese capital.[65] A second referendum was held in Ireland in 2009, and the outcome was the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon by all EU member states, including Ireland.\n From 2005 to 2010, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates' cabinet faced increasing challenges due to economic and financial downturn. Portuguese economy was in crisis since 2002 owing to stagnation and high unemployment; in the late 2000s, Europe's sovereign debt crisis led to huge deficits and even higher rampant unemployment in Portugal. International financial markets compelled the Portuguese Government, like other European governments, to make radical changes in economic policy. Thus in September 2010, the Portuguese Government announced a fresh austerity package following other Eurozone partners, aiming to halve its budget deficit by 2011 with a series of tax hikes and salary cuts for public servants. In 2009, the deficit had been 9.4%, one of the highest in the Eurozone and way above the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact 3% limit. The Portuguese Government earlier targeted a 2011 shortfall of 5.1% but a growing crisis sparked by chronic budget expenditure, massive debt and deficit problems, forced Portugal to take even more difficult measures. In September, pressure from the International Monetary Fund, Ecofin, OECD and the main opposition party, forced S\u00f3crates' cabinet to adopt successive packages of radical austerity measures, contrary to what had been promised during the previous electoral campaigns.\nA report published in January 2011 by the Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias, a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated that in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010, the democratic Portuguese Republic governments have encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This has funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable slippage in state-managed public works, inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky credit, public debt creation and mismanaged European structural and cohesion funds for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister S\u00f3crates's cabinet was not able to forecast or prevent any of this when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and later was incapable of doing anything to ameliorate the situation when the country was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2011.[66]\n On 6 April 2011, having already resigned as Prime Minister, S\u00f3crates went on television to announce that Portugal, facing bankruptcy, would request financial assistance from the IMF (at the time managed by Dominique Strauss-Kahn) and the European Financial Stability Facility, as Greece and the Republic of Ireland had already done. The announcement was made 48 hours after S\u00f3crates had categorically denied the move would be needed.\n On 23 March 2011, S\u00f3crates resigned following passage of a no confidence motion sponsored by all five opposition parties in parliament over spending cuts and tax increases.[67] Before the vote, S\u00f3crates had stated that he would resign if the vote for further austerity measures didn't pass.[68] As a result, a general election was held on 5 June 2011.[68]\n The Portuguese government fell a day before an EU summit was due to take place to finalise the EU's response to countries requiring a bailout in the future.[69]\n After losing the Portuguese legislative election of 2011, held on 5 June 2011, he resigned from Secretary-General of the Socialist Party.\n In March 2007, Universidade Independente (UnI), a private university in Lisbon, was placed under investigation for alleged irregularities on several matters.\n In that same month, S\u00f3crates' licenciatura degree in civil engineering by Universidade Independente was put under enormous public scrutiny.[33] Journalists found that qualifications awarded did not follow procedure and that four of the five academic disciplines were given in the private university by the same professor, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Moraes, a socialist government appointee. A fifth academic discipline, \"technical English\" was given by the Independente's rector. A strong case was built up related to possible false declarations by Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates regarding his university degree, and the way he was awarded this degree in civil engineering. Among other issues, the Independente degree in civil engineering was not an accredited degree, a civil engineering department was not yet established at that university, one examination was sent by fax and S\u00f3crates' diploma was issued on a Sunday, a day on which the university was always closed.\n Some Portuguese news media professionals stated that S\u00f3crates or members of his staff, through phone calls, threatened court action against journalists and tried to stop the reportings on his licenciatura degree awarded by UnI.[70] On 9 April 2007, Universidade Independente was closed by government officials after an investigation reported several serious irregularities in the running of this private university.\n Under heavy pressure, S\u00f3crates provided his version of the facts on Wednesday 11 April 2007 in a live broadcast interview for the RTP 1 TV channel and RDP radio. The Prime Minister stated he was not favoured by the Universidade Independente to obtain the degree, declared he had been the target of \"catty accusations\", and defended the authenticity of the degree, though admitting he is not a fully chartered civil engineer.[71] In his official biography at the Portuguese Government's official website S\u00f3crates claimed to have already obtained the qualification of engineer. He later admitted that this was a \"lapse\", and the government website altered his CV, downgrading \"civil engineer\" to \"diploma in civil engineering\". In the interest of accuracy, he should have used \"licenciado em engenharia civil\" instead of \"engenheiro\". Before he had been granted the degree, he presented himself as an \"engineer\" when he was solely a \"technical engineer\". Portuguese Parliament documents with official information on S\u00f3crates personal data were found, proving such inconsistencies.[72] S\u00f3crates and his staff replied to this by stating that it was probably a misunderstanding in the parliamentary services. After having the licenciatura diploma he used the title \"engineer\" in several official documents, despite the fact that his unaccredited degree in civil engineering from Universidade Independente was not legally recognized to allow for the use of the title \"engineer\"; a profession which is regulated in Portugal by the Ordem dos Engenheiros.\n Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was fiercely criticised by members of Portugal's democratic opposition in the Parliament regarding both proved and unproven issues related with this controversy. Nicolau Santos, a television journalist and a director of Expresso newspaper, criticised the controversial series of fait-divers published in P\u00fablico and claimed that despite the extensive coverage of details, P\u00fablico's investigation lead to \"no definitive conclusion\" and might be connected with other issues. In the same tone, several other media personalities, like SIC Not\u00edcias' journalist Ricardo Costa, also suggested controversially that SONAE corporation, the parent company of P\u00fablico newspaper, was behind the beginning of the controversy due to a failed takeover bid of SONAE's telecommunications operator over the largest Portuguese telecom \u2013 Portugal Telecom.[73] The complexity of the takeover bid involving the largest Portuguese telecom, prompted State intervention by the Autoridade da Concorr\u00eancia (The Portuguese Competition Authority).\n It was found that a close friend of S\u00f3crates, Armando Vara, was also awarded a diploma by the Universidade Independente days before he was appointed to a high ranking banking administration position in the state-run Caixa Geral de Dep\u00f3sitos, which in turn was strictly opened to candidates holding at last one academic degree in any subject.\n State authorities investigated the affair and archived the file on the grounds that the suspicions of falsification and irregularities allegedly attributed to Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates turned out to be formally impossible to prove.[citation needed] On the other hand, the Universidade Independente was investigated by education state authorities, which resulted in the compulsory closing of that private university in October 2007, due to lack of academic rigour and teaching quality, along with generalized managerial and financial chaos in the institution.[74]\n A low-cost Intel Classmate PC-based netbook for use by children, announced and sponsored by S\u00f3crates' cabinet, named Magalh\u00e3es (after Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es), assembled by the Portuguese company J.P. S\u00e1 Couto, was at the centre of a controversy on 7 October 2008, when the company was suspected of \u20ac5\u00a0million worth of tax evasion.[75] J.P. S\u00e1 Couto dismissed all the accusations regarding alleged fiscal fraud within the company.[76] Other major controversy regarding Magalh\u00e3es computer were the legal issues about public contracting procedure in the agreement involving the Government and the company J.P. S\u00e1 Couto. The case led to an investigation that raised other similar issues involving other governmental agreements and public contracts.[77]\n Since 2005, and, especially again in 2009, it was suggested by some Portuguese and British media that Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates allegedly waived environmental restrictions, following intervention by one of his uncles and a cousin, to grant the British company Freeport a licence to build the Alcochete mall, a gigantic emporium near the Tagus river, developed in part on protected land outside Lisbon in 2002, when he was Minister for Environment of the PM Ant\u00f3nio Guterres cabinet.[78][79]\nPortuguese authorities have meanwhile insisted Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was not under investigation, nor was he a suspect, while UK's Serious Fraud Office refused to confirm the veracity of reports emanating in Portugal. Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates also stated the Freeport project was in due compliance with all legal requirements at the time.[80] J\u00falio Eduardo Coelho Monteiro, a businessman who is an uncle of Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, told the Portuguese newspaper Sol how he established contact between his nephew and Freeport's representatives.\n In a DVD held by the British police and released in March 2009 by the Portuguese media, Charles Smith, a consultant hired to handle the licensing of the Freeport of Alcochete, clearly stated that Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates \"was corrupt\" and that he received, through a cousin, money to give the green light to the project for the \"outlet\". The recording revealed by TVI is only part of a conversation of 20 minutes that alongside Charles Smith also included John Cabral, an official of the consultant, and Alan Perkins, director of Freeport. It was the latter who, without knowledge of the other two, has recorded the event, where Smith and Cabral were questioned about the money that left the company to be used for the payment of \"gloves\" to the current Prime Minister. Charles Smith is one of two defendants in the case Freeport, commercial space on the process of Freeport Alcochete, related to alleged suspicions of corruption in the amendment to the Special Protection Area of the Tagus estuary (ZPET) decided three days before the elections of 2002, through a decree-law, when Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was Minister of Environment.\n The conversation now revealed took place in 2006 with the aim of explaining the large outgoing amounts of money from the company's headquarters in London at the time of approval of the project. According to some sources contacted in London by TVI, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates remains the main suspect of British police. The British police are now set to send to the Portuguese authorities the 25 volumes of all research done in this process in England. The Serious Fraud Office, which investigates major financial fraud in Britain, has seen its activity limited due to the lack cooperation of the Portuguese authorities in investigating the case. The first official meeting took place only on 17 November 2008 in The Hague, the headquarters of Eurojust, a body which is designed to facilitate judicial cooperation in the EU. The judge C\u00e2ndida Almeida, director of DCIAP (Central Department for investigation and prosecution), which coordinates the department's prosecutor who investigates the case, refused a joint research proposal by the English. Then have taken note of the DVD. The prosecutor dropped the evidence, arguing that it was not in Portuguese law.[81]\n The Eurojust tried to distance itself from the scandal involving its head, Jos\u00e9 da Mota, a Portuguese, who allegedly put pressure on prosecutors in order to stop a corruption probe involving Portuguese Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates. Two magistrates dealing with the so-called Freeport affair accused Jos\u00e9 Mota of having tried to persuade them to side-line the investigation at the request of the Portuguese premier and the minister of justice. The premier and Mr Mota's relationship goes back to the late nineties, when they worked in the same government as state secretaries for environment and justice respectively. In 2002, when the new EU body was formed (Eurojust), Mr Mota was transferred to The Hague as Portugal's representative to Eurojust. He was elected head of the judicial co-operation body in 2007, at a time when the so-called Freeport case had already started in Portugal.[82]\n On 22 May 2012, Alan Perkins, a Freeport manager between 2005 and 2006, said, under oath in court, that illegal payments had been made to the minister of the Environment. At the time, the minister of the Environment was Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates.\n Another corruption case involving S\u00f3crates was the Face Oculta scandal. On 28 October 2009 the police began investigating a business group headquartered in Ovar. Armando Vara, one of the suspects, was reported to have had \"talks\" with S\u00f3crates. S\u00f3crates denied any involvement, claiming that he was only talking to a friend.[83]\n In February 2011 the company TMN, that belongs to Portugal Telecom, claimed that, because of an informatics-related problem, all the information and data about the case and related to Armando Vara (ex-vice-president of BCP), Rui Pedro Soares (ex-manager of PT), M\u00e1rio Lino (ex-minister) and Paulo Penedos (ex-assistant of PT) had disappeared.[84] David Dinis, editor of the Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias newspaper, quit his job because of pressure from the director, Jo\u00e3o Marcelino, to stop this information being spread by the press.[85]\n Socrates was not indicted as part of the Face Oculta probe,[86] but investigation of corruption charges continued under Operation Marquis.[87]\n In November 2014, Jos\u00e9 Socrates was arrested on suspicions of corruption and money-laundering,[88] it having become apparent that a close friend was holding millions of euros for his benefit.  Socrates claimed that he merely borrowed money from his friend, but there were no records of the amounts loaned, which admittedly funded a luxurious lifestyle in Paris after Socrates left the government.[89] This came to light during the government's Operation Marquis investigation.[90] He was originally held pending the conclusion of this investigation.[91][92] Socrates was imprisoned in the jail at \u00c9vora until September 2015 when he was remanded to house arrest at a relative's house in Lisbon.[93][94][95] He was freed from house arrest in October 2015, but was constrained to remain in Portugal and prohibited from contacting other suspects in the case, pending completion of the investigation.[96][97] In 2017, Socrates was formally indicted on corruption charges including bribery, money laundering and tax fraud.[98]\n The charges of document forgery, tax evasion, money laundering and misuse of political office were based upon three transactions:[99]\n ", "tags": ["1957 births", "Government ministers of Portugal", "Living people", "Members of the Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)", "Portuguese agnostics", "Portuguese engineers", "Portuguese socialists", "Presidents of the European Council", "Prime Ministers of Portugal", "R\u00e9sum\u00e9 frauds and controversies", "Social Democratic Party (Portugal) politicians", "Socialist Party (Portugal) politicians", "People from Alij\u00f3", "Portuguese prisoners and detainees", "Recipients of the Order of the White Star, 1st Class", "Heads of government who were later imprisoned", "CS1 Portuguese-language sources (pt)", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with Portuguese-language sources (pt)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from March 2011", "Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages", "Use dmy dates from May 2013", "Articles containing Portuguese-language text", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from October 2017", "Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThis name uses Portuguese naming customs: the first or maternal family name is Carvalho and the second or paternal family name is Pinto de Sousa.\nJos\u00e9 S\u00f3cratesGCIHPrime Minister of PortugalIn office12 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011PresidentJorge SampaioAn\u00edbal Cavaco SilvaPreceded byPedro Santana LopesSucceeded byPedro Passos CoelhoSecretary-General of the Socialist PartyIn office24 September 2004\u00a0\u2013 23 July 2011Preceded byFerro RodriguesSucceeded byAnt\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 SeguroLeader of the OppositionIn office24 September 2004\u00a0\u2013 12 March 2005Prime MinisterPedro Santana LopesPreceded byEduardo Ferro RodriguesSucceeded byPedro Santana LopesMinister of Social InfrastructureIn office23 January 2002\u00a0\u2013 6 April 2002Prime MinisterAnt\u00f3nio GuterresPreceded byEduardo Ferro RodriguesSucceeded byLu\u00eds Valente de OliveiraMinister of the EnvironmentIn office25 October 1999\u00a0\u2013 6 April 2002Prime MinisterAnt\u00f3nio GuterresPreceded byElisa FerreiraSucceeded byArlindo CunhaDeputy Prime MinisterIn office25 November 1997\u00a0\u2013 25 October 1999Prime MinisterAnt\u00f3nio GuterresPreceded byJorge CoelhoSucceeded byArmando VaraDeputy Secretary of State of the Minister of the EnvironmentIn office28 October 1995\u00a0\u2013 25 November 1997Prime MinisterAnt\u00f3nio GuterresPreceded byJoaquim Po\u00e7as MartinsAnt\u00f3nio Taveira da SilvaSucceeded byJos\u00e9 GuerreiroMember of the Assembly of the RepublicIn office19 July 1987\u00a0\u2013 5 June 2011ConstituencyCastelo Branco\nPersonal detailsBornJos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates Carvalho Pinto de Sousa (1957-09-06) 6 September 1957 (age\u00a063)Alij\u00f3, PortugalPolitical partySocial Democratic Party(Before 1981)Socialist Party(1981\u20132018)Independent(2018\u2013present)Spouse(s)Sofia Costa Pinto Fava (Divorced)ChildrenJos\u00e9 MiguelEduardoAlma materPolytechnic Institute of CoimbraLus\u00edada UniversityPolytechnic Institute of LisbonIndependente UniversityUniversity Institute of LisbonSignature\nJos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates Carvalho Pinto de Sousa, GCIH (born 6 September 1957), commonly known as Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates (Portuguese pronunciation:\u00a0[\u0292u\u02c8z\u025b \u02c8s\u0254k\u027e\u0250t\u0268\u0283]), is a Portuguese politician who was the Prime Minister of Portugal from 12 March 2005 to 21 June 2011. For the second half of 2007, he acted as the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union.\nS\u00f3crates grew up in the industrial city of Covilh\u00e3. He joined the centre-left Socialist Party in 1981 and was elected Member of Parliament in 1987. S\u00f3crates entered the government in 1995, as Secretary of State for Environment in the first cabinet of Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Two years later, he became Minister of Youth and Sports (where he helped to organize Portugal's successful bid to host UEFA Euro 2004) and in 1999 became Minister for Environment. S\u00f3crates prominence rose during the governments of Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to the point that when the Prime Minister resigned in 2001, he considered to appoint S\u00f3crates as his successor.[1]\nIn opposition, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was elected leader of the Socialist Party in 2004 and led the party to its first absolute majority in the 2005 election. By then, Portugal was living an economic crisis, marked by stagnation and a difficult state of public finances. Like the preceding centre-right government, S\u00f3crates implemented a policy of fiscal austerity and structural reforms.[2][3] Among the most important reforms were the 2007 Social Security reform and the 2009 labour law reform.[4][5] His government also restructured the provision of public services, closing thousands of elementary schools[6] and dozens of health care facilities and maternity wards in rural areas and small cities.[7][8] Despite austerity, S\u00f3crates's government intended to boost economic growth through government-sponsored investments, namely in transportation, technology and energy as well as in health and school infrastructure. The government launched several public-private partnerships to finance such projects. Internally, S\u00f3crates was accused of having an authoritarian style and of trying to control media,[9] while internationally he completed the negotiations of Lisbon Treaty[10] and had close ties with leaders such as the Prime Minister of Spain Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodriguez Zapatero[11] and the President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez.[12] The first S\u00f3crates government was initially able to reduce the budget deficit[13] and controlling public debt,[14] but economic growth lagged.[15]\nIn 2008\u201309, with the Great Recession starting to hit Portugal and facing recession and high unemployment,[16] austerity was waned as part of the European economic stimulus plan.[17] Nevertheless, support for S\u00f3crates and the Socialists eroded and the ruling party lost its majority in the 2009 election.[16] The second government of Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates faced a deterioration of the economic and financial state of the country, with skyrocketing deficit and growing debt.[16] Austerity was resumed in 2010 while the country entered a hard financial crisis in the context of the European debt crisis.[18]\nOn 23 March 2011, S\u00f3crates submitted his resignation to President An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva after the Parliament rejected a new austerity package (the fourth in a year), leading to the 2011 snap election. Financial status of the country deteriorated and on 6 April S\u00f3crates caretaker government requested a bail-out program which was conceded. The \u20ac78 billion IMF/European Union bailout to Portugal thus started and would last until May 2014. S\u00f3crates lost the snap election held on 5 June 2011 and resigned as Secretary-General of the Socialist Party.[19] For most of his political career, S\u00f3crates was associated to several corruption cases, notably Independente University and Freeport cases.[9]\nOn 21 November 2014 he was arrested in Lisbon, accused of corruption, tax evasion, and money laundering, becoming the first former Prime Minister in the history of the country to be thus accused.[20][21][22] On 24 November S\u00f3crates was remanded in custody on preliminary charges of corruption and tax fraud.[23][24] He was held in \u00c9vora prison until 4 September 2015 when he left the prison for a relative's house in Lisbon, where he remained under house arrest until 16 October 2015.[25][26] That day, a judge released him from house arrest, allowing him to await the end of the investigation in freedom, although remaining forbidden of leaving the country and of contacting with other suspects of the case.[27][28] The police investigation, known as Operation Marquis continued until his indictment in October 2017. In 2018, S\u00f3crates abandoned the Socialist Party.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early years\n1.2 Education\n1.3 Political career\n1.4 Personal life\n\n1.4.1 Family and residence\n1.4.2 Health and well-being\n\n\n\n\n2 Prime Minister of Portugal\n\n2.1 S\u00f3crates government\n\n2.1.1 Membership\n2.1.2 Major policies\n\n2.1.2.1 Administrative reforms\n2.1.2.2 Technological plan\n2.1.2.3 Educational reforms\n2.1.2.4 Transportation developments\n2.1.2.5 Other\n\n\n2.1.3 Presidency of the Council of the European Union\n2.1.4 Economic crisis\n2.1.5 Fall of government\n\n\n\n\n3 Controversies\n\n3.1 S\u00f3crates\u2013Independente affair\n\n3.1.1 Investigation\n\n\n3.2 Magalh\u00e3es computer\n3.3 Freeport outlet controversy\n3.4 Face Oculta scandal\n3.5 Corruption investigation\n\n\n4 References and notes\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nEarly years[edit]\nJos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was born in Porto on 6 September 1957, and was registered as a newborn in Vilar de Ma\u00e7ada, Alij\u00f3 municipality, in northeastern Portugal, since the locality was his family ancestral homeland. However, the young Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates lived throughout his childhood and teen years with his father, a divorced building designer, in the city of Covilh\u00e3, Cova da Beira subregion, in central inland Portugal, in the Centro region. His parents are Fernando Pinto de Sousa (Vilar de Ma\u00e7ada, Alij\u00f3, 15 November 1926 \u2013 Oporto, 18 July 2011)[29] and wife and remote relative Maria Adelaide de Carvalho Monteiro (b. Vilar de Ma\u00e7ada, Alij\u00f3, 8 October 1931). He has two younger siblings, Ant\u00f3nio Carvalho Pinto de Sousa, born circa 1962, and Ana Maria Carvalho Pinto de Sousa, died in 1988. He is a descendant of the illegitimate daughter of Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Gir\u00e3o Teixeira Lobo Barbosa (Porto, S\u00e9, 9 January 1715 \u2013 Alij\u00f3, Vilar de Ma\u00e7ada), Fidalgo of the Royal Household and Knight of the Order of Christ.[30]\n\nEducation[edit]\nJos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates studied in Covilh\u00e3's basic and secondary schools, until the age of 18. Then, in 1975, he went to Coimbra in order to attend a higher education institution. He earned in 1979 his 4-year bacharelato[31] degree as a civil technical engineer from the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra (in 1988 incorporated into the Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Coimbra). From 1987 to 1993, he took law classes at Universidade Lus\u00edada, a private university in Lisbon, but failed to graduate.[32] In 1994/95, already a well-known politician, he briefly attended the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa where he completed some academic disciplines in order to get a CESE diploma (a complementary diploma to his bacharelato degree because until 1999 the polytechnic institutions did not offer licenciatura degrees), but instead, under circumstances which would provoke a controversy in 2007, he earned in 1996 the licenciatura (licentiate degree) in civil engineering from the Universidade Independente, a private university in Lisbon which was shut down by Portuguese authorities in 2007/2008.[33] He also has an MBA degree awarded in 2005 by ISCTE, a public university institute in Lisbon, that he obtained after had attended successfully the first year of a 2-year master's degree program of ISCTE that he did not complete.[34] After his tenure as Prime Minister of Portugal ended in 2011, S\u00f3crates and his elder son, moved to Paris where S\u00f3crates attended the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris (known as SciencesPo).[35] In 2013, SciencesPo awarded him his master's degree in political science.[36] His 2013 book Confian\u00e7a do Mundo - Sobre a Tortura Em Democracia[37] was based on his masters thesis there;[36] however, there was some dispute as to its authorship.[38][39]\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nJos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was one of the founders of JSD (the youth branch of PSD \u2013 Portuguese Social Democratic Party) before changing his political affiliation and applying for membership in the PS \u2013 Portuguese Socialist Party. He has been a member of the Socialist Party since 1981. Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates served as a technical engineer for the Covilh\u00e3 City Council, and has been elected a member of the Portuguese Parliament since 1987, representing the Castelo Branco electoral district. While serving as the chairperson of the Castelo Branco Federation of the Socialist Party (1983\u20131996), he was elected to the Party's National Secretariat in 1991. Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was ousted by the Board of the Guarda Municipality in 1990 and 1991, after being warned several times because of poor quality of construction projects and lack of monitoring of the construction works. S\u00f3crates was threatened with disciplinary action for wrongdoings in the technical direction of particular works of whose projects he was the author, but despite being ousted from this capacity, he was never penalized. In addition, as a Member of the Parliament, S\u00f3crates was not allowed by law to work as a technical engineer between 1987 and 1991.[40] From 1989 to 1996, he served as a member of the Covilh\u00e3 Municipal Assembly. He served as spokesperson on environmental affairs for the Socialist Party from 1991 to 1995. In 1995, he entered government as secretary of state for Environment in the first government of Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Two years later, S\u00f3crates became Minister for Youth and Sports and was one of the organizers of the EURO 2004 cup in Portugal. He became Minister for Environment in Guterres' second government in 1999. Following the elections of 2002 (won by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso), S\u00f3crates became a member of the opposition in the Portuguese Parliament. Meanwhile, he also had a program of political analysis, hosted jointly with Pedro Santana Lopes on RTP. After the resignation of Ferro Rodrigues as party leader in 2004, he won a bid for the post of secretary-general against Manuel Alegre and Jo\u00e3o Soares, winning the vote of nearly 80% of party members on 24 September 2004. After the victory of his party in the 2005 Portuguese election, S\u00f3crates was called on 24 February by president Jorge Sampaio to form a new government \u2013 the 17th Constitutional Government (after 1976). After the Portuguese legislative election of 2009, held on 27 September 2009, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was elected for a second term as Prime Minister of Portugal. He was also a Member of the Portuguese Council of State as the Prime-Minister.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nFamily and residence[edit]\nS\u00f3crates is divorced from Sofia Costa Pinto Fava,[41] an engineer, with whom he has two sons, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Fava Pinto de Sousa (b. 1993) and Eduardo Fava Pinto de Sousa (b. 1995). Sofia is a daughter of Jos\u00e9 Manuel Carvalho Fava, an architect, and Clotilde Mesquita (daughter of Armando Mesquita and Palmira da Costa Pinto), engineer and sister of Alexandre Mesquita Carvalho Fava and Mara Mesquita Carvalho Fava. S\u00f3crates lives in Lisbon, although he used to be a registered elector of the municipality of Covilh\u00e3, the place where he voted until the law was changed (since after the mid-2000s every person votes in one's residential area).\n\nHealth and well-being[edit]\nJos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates had photos of himself taken during his morning jog at places like the Red Square in Moscow, Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana, Luanda, and Lisbon. In January 2008, a smoking ban came into force in Portugal's public buildings and on public transport, but S\u00f3crates was reported to have been smoking in May during a private state flight to Venezuela where he met Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. He has since admitted it was a mistake, apologized and promised to quit smoking. In addition, he claimed he was not aware he was breaking the law when he did so.[42] However, by 2012, after he had left the spotlight, the Portuguese newspaper Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias reported he was no longer a non-smoker.[43]\n\nPrime Minister of Portugal[edit]\nAfter the Portuguese legislative election of 2005, S\u00f3crates was called on 24 February by president Jorge Sampaio to form a new government. S\u00f3crates and his first government (XVII Governo Constitucional) took office on 12 March 2005.\nAfter the Portuguese legislative election of 2009, held on 27 September 2009, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was elected for a second term as Prime Minister of Portugal. The new government was sworn into office on 26 October 2009.\nOn 5 June 2011, after the Portuguese legislative election of 2011, the victory of Social Democratic Party (Portuguese: Partido Social Democrata) led by Pedro Passos Coelho, forced his resignation as Secretary-General of the Socialist Party.\n\nS\u00f3crates government[edit]\nS\u00f3crates headed the government beginning on 12 March 2005, comprising the XVII and XVIII Governos Constitucionais (17th and 18th Constitutional Governments).\n\nMembership[edit]\n\n\nMinistry\n\nIncumbent\n\nTerm\n\n\nState and Internal Administration\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Costa\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 17 May 2007\n\n\nRui Pereira\n\n17 May 2007\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nState and Foreign Affairs\n\nDiogo Freitas do Amaral\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 3 July 2006\n\n\nLu\u00eds Amado\n\n3 July 2006\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nState and Finances\n\nLu\u00eds Campos e Cunha\n\n13 March\u00a0\u2013 21 July 2005\n\n\nFernando Teixeira dos Santos\n\n21 July 2005\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nPresidency\n\nPedro Silva Pereira\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nNational Defence\n\nLu\u00eds Amado\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 3 July 2006\n\n\nNuno Severiano Teixeira\n\n3 July 2006\u00a0\u2013 26 October 2009\n\n\nAugusto Santos Silva\n\n2 October 2009\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nJustice\n\nAlberto Costa\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 26 October 2009\n\n\nAlberto Martins\n\n26 October 2009\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nEnvironment\n\nFrancisco Nunes Correia\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 26 October 2009\n\n\nDulce \u00c1lvaro P\u00e1ssaro\n\n26 October 2009\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nEconomy, Innovation and Development\n\nManuel Pinho\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 2 July 2009\n\n\nFernando Teixeira dos Santos\n\n2 July\u00a0\u2013 26 October 2009\n\n\nJos\u00e9 Vieira da Silva\n\n26 October 2009\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nAgriculture\n\nJaime Silva\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 26 October 2009\n\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Soares Serrano\n\n26 October 2009\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nPublic Works and Communications\n\nM\u00e1rio Lino\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 26 October 2009\n\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Augusto Mendon\u00e7a\n\n26 October 2009\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nLabour and Social Solidarity\n\nJos\u00e9 Vieira da Silva\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 26 October 2009\n\n\nMaria Helena Andr\u00e9\n\n26 October 2009\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nHealth\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Correia de Campos\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 30 January 2008\n\n\nAna Jorge\n\n30 January 2008\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nEducation\n\nMaria de Lurdes Rodrigues\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 26 October 2009\n\n\nIsabel Al\u00e7ada\n\n26 October 2009\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nScience, Technology and High Education\n\nMariano Gago\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nCulture\n\nIsabel Pires de Lima\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 30 January 2008\n\n\nJos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio Pinto Ribeiro\n\n30 January 2008\u00a0\u2013 26 October 2009\n\n\nGabriela Canavilhas\n\n26 October 2009\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\n\nParliamentary Affairs\n\nAugusto Santos Silva\n\n13 March 2005\u00a0\u2013 26 October 2009\n\n\nJorge Lac\u00e3o\n\n26 October 2009\u00a0\u2013 21 June 2011\n\nMajor policies[edit]\nAdministrative reforms[edit]\n Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates and President Dilma Rousseff in 2011\nThe XVII Governo Constitucional government, headed by Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, tried to create new rules and implement reforms aiming at better efficiency and rationalized resource allocation in the public sector, fighting civil servant overcapacity (excedent\u00e1rios) and reducing bureaucracy for both citizens and companies (e.g.: empresa na hora,[44] PRACE \u2013 Programa de Reestrutura\u00e7\u00e3o da Administra\u00e7\u00e3o Central do Estado,[45] and SIMPLEX \u2013 Programa de Simplifica\u00e7\u00e3o Administrativa e Legislativa),[46] among others. Since the XVII Governo Constitucional government (with Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates as Prime Minister and Teixeira dos Santos as Minister of Finance) Portugal's fiscal policy improved with a steady increase of the number of taxpayers and the growth of the receipt amount from State taxation. However these policies had little effect, and the country's public debt and deficit were both out of control by 2010, along with a record high unemployment rate. Jo\u00e3o Bilhim directed in 2005 the committee responsible for the Programme for Restructuring the State's Central Administration (PRACE) but was said to be disappointed with the results.[47] Several reforms and measures implemented in 2006/2007 by the government (XVII Governo Constitucional \u2013 headed by Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates), resulted in improved welfare system financial sustainability but reduced income expectations of future pensioners up to 40%.[48] In addition, economically active people must work for more years before retirement than formerly.[49] A sustainability factor was also introduced, giving employees the option of working longer or receiving slightly lower pensions, as life expectancy forecasts increase. After the Portuguese regionalization referendum of 1998 where the \"No\" to regionalization of the mainland into eight administrative regions was victorious, the XVII Governo Constitucional government announced in January 2009[50] its firm intention of starting again a regionalization process for Portugal. According to this governmental project, mainland Portugal was to be regionalized into five regions with a wide range of administrative autonomy, using the already established NUTS II system: Alentejo, Algarve, Lisbon and Tagus Valley, Central Portugal and Northern Portugal. The transformation of the Portuguese public administration from a traditional one to an information technology-based multiplatform service, was praised by the European Commission through its European Union benchmark for the sector, that consecutively placed Portugal in the first position of the ranking in 2009 and 2010.[51]\n\nTechnological plan[edit]\n Chris Dedicoat, Helder Antunes, and S\u00f3crates at the 2008 Cisco Portugal Official Inauguration.\nOne of the government's main policies was the Plano Tecnol\u00f3gico (Technological Plan), aimed at increasing Portugal's competitivity through the modernization of its economy. The plan consisted of three key areas: knowledge, technology and innovation.[52] A low-cost Intel-based netbook for use by children announced by S\u00f3crates's government cabinet, named Magalh\u00e3es (after Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es) and packaged and assembled for the Portuguese school-age children and the low-to-middle income economy export market by the Portuguese company J.P. S\u00e1 Couto, headquartered in Matosinhos, Norte region, was among the government's innovations under the Technological Plan. Governmental efforts in the technological domain also included state support of a Portuguese factory that was owned by the German-based semiconductor company Qimonda AG, in Vila do Conde, Norte region, when the parent company filed a bankruptcy petition with the local court in Munich, Germany, in early 2009. Qimonda Portugal was at the time one of the top Portuguese net exporters of technology.[53]\nThe European Innovation Scoreboard of 2010 placed Portugal-based innovation in 15th position, as a result of an impressive increase in innovation expenditure and output.[54]\n\nEducational reforms[edit]\nThe government allocated more resources for education policy and reorganised the sector aiming more choice and better quality in vocational technical education. Enhanced and improved vocational technical education programs were implemented in 2007 in an effort to revitalize this sector which had been almost discontinued after the Carnation Revolution of 1974. Other education reforms included more financial support for students (in all educational levels), systematic teaching and school evaluation, the compulsory closing of some problematic and unreliable private higher education institutions (like the Independente University and Moderna University) by the Minister for Science, Technology and Higher Education, Mariano Gago, and a will to rank and benchmark the higher education institutions through a newly created state-run agency (the Ag\u00eancia de Acredita\u00e7\u00e3o e Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do Ensino Superior). During the XVII Governo Constitucional, the pan-European Bologna Process was fully implemented in Portugal.\nOn the other hand, the government created a policy of certification and equivalence of qualifications for adult people with low levels of formal education who want a 4th, 6th, 9th or 12th grade equivalence without returning to school (for example, through this process, called Novas Oportunidades,[55][56] adults\u201418 years old and older\u2014with the 9th grade might be granted an equivalence to the 12th grade after a process ranging from a part-time 3-month programme or a 1-day-per-week 8-month programme; those who have less than 9th grade have a similar programme to get the 9th grade certification and can then apply to the 12th grade programme). The curricula do not include any classical high school discipline or a traditional examination process. These diplomas are awarded based on vaguely construed life experience. Some critics alleged this policy was an effort to make up the poor national statistical indicators on education, with little impact on the quality of the work force's qualification of Portugal in the European Union context.[57][58][59]\nAccording to the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the average Portuguese 15-year-old student was for many years underrated and underachieving in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge in the OECD, nearly tied with the Italian and just above those from countries like Greece, Turkey and Mexico. However, since 2010, PISA results for Portuguese students improved dramatically. The PISA 2009 report states that the average Portuguese 15-year-old student, when rated in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge, is placed at the same level as those students from the United States, Sweden, Germany, Ireland, France, Denmark, United Kingdom, Hungary and Taipei, with 489 points (493 is the average).[60] However, a couple of weeks later, the Portuguese Ministry of Education announced a 2010 report published by its office for educational evaluation GAVE (Gabinete de Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o) which criticized the results of PISA 2009 report and claimed that the average Portuguese teenage student had profound handicaps in terms of expression, communication and logic, as well as a low performance when asked to solve problems.[61]\n\nTransportation developments[edit]\n S\u00f3crates speaking in the ceremonial opening of a new railway line, on 27 March 2010.\nPrime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates and his government team supported the decision of building new transportation infrastructure such as a new airport for Lisbon and a high speed rail network. For months the government of Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates insisted the country's only option for a new airport was in the Ota region north of Lisbon. But a powerful lobby, headed by local business honchos and given the imprimatur of the Portuguese president An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, forced S\u00f3crates's Government into reversal, by bringing an alternative site for the new airport \u2013 the Portuguese Air Force's shooting range in Alcochete east of Lisbon. A study commissioned by a group of businesspeople said the Alcochete site would save taxpayers as much as \u20ac3bn in construction costs, and would have less of an environmental impact. The government argued that Ota was a key piece of its overall transport strategy, which included highspeed rail lines to Spain, but even so recognized that the project wasn't finalized and that a debate on the pros and cons of both sites would be worthwhile. Then the government commissioned a technical study to the state-run civil engineering laboratory (Portuguese: Laborat\u00f3rio Nacional de Engenharia Civil) comparing both locations one to each other. Following the conclusions of that study, on 10 January 2008 the Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates announced the option Alcochete as the most rational choice for a new airport for Lisbon.\n\nOther[edit]\nIn 2007, the XVII Governo Constitucional, headed by Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, legalised abortion in Portugal after a referendum. Voters were being asked to decide whether to make abortion legal in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, if carried out at the woman's request in a registered clinic. Despite the turnout for a referendum being too low (40%; 50% needed) to be legally binding, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates said: \"Our interest is to fight clandestine abortion and we have to produce a law that respects the result of the referendum.\"[62] This socialist government cabinet also announced its intention to legalize same-sex marriage at some point during its mandate. Same-sex marriage in Portugal was legalized on 17 May 2010.\nAlso, in 2009, through the Decree-Law 91/2009, the rights of fathers and mothers were equalled under the law (see also Fathers' rights).\nAfter a sharp increase of the violent crime rate in Portugal during the XVII Governo Constitucional government (2005\u20132009), the Minister of Internal Administration Rui Pereira announced in February 2009 the expansion of the police force through the recruitment of 2,000 new police officers, 7,000 new state-of-the-art police weapons, 1,000 bulletproof vests, among other measures.[63]\nUntil 2010, for stock held for more than twelve months the capital gain was exempt. The capital gain of stock held for shorter periods of time was taxable on 10%. From 2010 onwards, for residents, all capital gain of stock and other assets above \u20ac500 is taxable on 20%. Investment funds, banks and corporations are in general exempted of capital gain tax over stock.\n\nPresidency of the Council of the European Union[edit]\n Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, Lula da Silva, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso and Janez Jansa during the EU-Brazil conference in Lisbon 2007\nJos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, as Prime Minister of Portugal, presided over the rotative Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the period July\u2013December 2007.[64] In this post, S\u00f3crates and his team focused on the EU-Brazil (1st EU-Brazil summit) and EU-African Union (2007 Africa-EU Summit) relations, as well as in the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Portuguese Parliament voted to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon on 23 April 2008. After the Irish referendum on 12 June 2008, Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates said he saw the Irish \"No\" to the treaty as a \"personal defeat\" after it was signed by EU leaders in the Portuguese capital.[65] A second referendum was held in Ireland in 2009, and the outcome was the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon by all EU member states, including Ireland.\n\nEconomic crisis[edit]\nMain article: Economic history of Portugal\nFrom 2005 to 2010, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates' cabinet faced increasing challenges due to economic and financial downturn. Portuguese economy was in crisis since 2002 owing to stagnation and high unemployment; in the late 2000s, Europe's sovereign debt crisis led to huge deficits and even higher rampant unemployment in Portugal. International financial markets compelled the Portuguese Government, like other European governments, to make radical changes in economic policy. Thus in September 2010, the Portuguese Government announced a fresh austerity package following other Eurozone partners, aiming to halve its budget deficit by 2011 with a series of tax hikes and salary cuts for public servants. In 2009, the deficit had been 9.4%, one of the highest in the Eurozone and way above the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact 3% limit. The Portuguese Government earlier targeted a 2011 shortfall of 5.1% but a growing crisis sparked by chronic budget expenditure, massive debt and deficit problems, forced Portugal to take even more difficult measures. In September, pressure from the International Monetary Fund, Ecofin, OECD and the main opposition party, forced S\u00f3crates' cabinet to adopt successive packages of radical austerity measures, contrary to what had been promised during the previous electoral campaigns.\nA report published in January 2011 by the Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias, a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated that in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010, the democratic Portuguese Republic governments have encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This has funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable slippage in state-managed public works, inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky credit, public debt creation and mismanaged European structural and cohesion funds for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister S\u00f3crates's cabinet was not able to forecast or prevent any of this when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and later was incapable of doing anything to ameliorate the situation when the country was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2011.[66]\nOn 6 April 2011, having already resigned as Prime Minister, S\u00f3crates went on television to announce that Portugal, facing bankruptcy, would request financial assistance from the IMF (at the time managed by Dominique Strauss-Kahn) and the European Financial Stability Facility, as Greece and the Republic of Ireland had already done. The announcement was made 48 hours after S\u00f3crates had categorically denied the move would be needed.\n\nFall of government[edit]\nOn 23 March 2011, S\u00f3crates resigned following passage of a no confidence motion sponsored by all five opposition parties in parliament over spending cuts and tax increases.[67] Before the vote, S\u00f3crates had stated that he would resign if the vote for further austerity measures didn't pass.[68] As a result, a general election was held on 5 June 2011.[68]\nThe Portuguese government fell a day before an EU summit was due to take place to finalise the EU's response to countries requiring a bailout in the future.[69]\nAfter losing the Portuguese legislative election of 2011, held on 5 June 2011, he resigned from Secretary-General of the Socialist Party.\n\nControversies[edit]\nS\u00f3crates\u2013Independente affair[edit]\nIn March 2007, Universidade Independente (UnI), a private university in Lisbon, was placed under investigation for alleged irregularities on several matters.\nIn that same month, S\u00f3crates' licenciatura degree in civil engineering by Universidade Independente was put under enormous public scrutiny.[33] Journalists found that qualifications awarded did not follow procedure and that four of the five academic disciplines were given in the private university by the same professor, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Moraes, a socialist government appointee. A fifth academic discipline, \"technical English\" was given by the Independente's rector. A strong case was built up related to possible false declarations by Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates regarding his university degree, and the way he was awarded this degree in civil engineering. Among other issues, the Independente degree in civil engineering was not an accredited degree, a civil engineering department was not yet established at that university, one examination was sent by fax and S\u00f3crates' diploma was issued on a Sunday, a day on which the university was always closed.\nSome Portuguese news media professionals stated that S\u00f3crates or members of his staff, through phone calls, threatened court action against journalists and tried to stop the reportings on his licenciatura degree awarded by UnI.[70] On 9 April 2007, Universidade Independente was closed by government officials after an investigation reported several serious irregularities in the running of this private university.\nUnder heavy pressure, S\u00f3crates provided his version of the facts on Wednesday 11 April 2007 in a live broadcast interview for the RTP 1 TV channel and RDP radio. The Prime Minister stated he was not favoured by the Universidade Independente to obtain the degree, declared he had been the target of \"catty accusations\", and defended the authenticity of the degree, though admitting he is not a fully chartered civil engineer.[71] In his official biography at the Portuguese Government's official website S\u00f3crates claimed to have already obtained the qualification of engineer. He later admitted that this was a \"lapse\", and the government website altered his CV, downgrading \"civil engineer\" to \"diploma in civil engineering\". In the interest of accuracy, he should have used \"licenciado em engenharia civil\" instead of \"engenheiro\". Before he had been granted the degree, he presented himself as an \"engineer\" when he was solely a \"technical engineer\". Portuguese Parliament documents with official information on S\u00f3crates personal data were found, proving such inconsistencies.[72] S\u00f3crates and his staff replied to this by stating that it was probably a misunderstanding in the parliamentary services. After having the licenciatura diploma he used the title \"engineer\" in several official documents, despite the fact that his unaccredited degree in civil engineering from Universidade Independente was not legally recognized to allow for the use of the title \"engineer\"; a profession which is regulated in Portugal by the Ordem dos Engenheiros.\nJos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was fiercely criticised by members of Portugal's democratic opposition in the Parliament regarding both proved and unproven issues related with this controversy. Nicolau Santos, a television journalist and a director of Expresso newspaper, criticised the controversial series of fait-divers published in P\u00fablico and claimed that despite the extensive coverage of details, P\u00fablico's investigation lead to \"no definitive conclusion\" and might be connected with other issues. In the same tone, several other media personalities, like SIC Not\u00edcias' journalist Ricardo Costa, also suggested controversially that SONAE corporation, the parent company of P\u00fablico newspaper, was behind the beginning of the controversy due to a failed takeover bid of SONAE's telecommunications operator over the largest Portuguese telecom \u2013 Portugal Telecom.[73] The complexity of the takeover bid involving the largest Portuguese telecom, prompted State intervention by the Autoridade da Concorr\u00eancia (The Portuguese Competition Authority).\nIt was found that a close friend of S\u00f3crates, Armando Vara, was also awarded a diploma by the Universidade Independente days before he was appointed to a high ranking banking administration position in the state-run Caixa Geral de Dep\u00f3sitos, which in turn was strictly opened to candidates holding at last one academic degree in any subject.\n\nInvestigation[edit]\nState authorities investigated the affair and archived the file on the grounds that the suspicions of falsification and irregularities allegedly attributed to Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates turned out to be formally impossible to prove.[citation needed] On the other hand, the Universidade Independente was investigated by education state authorities, which resulted in the compulsory closing of that private university in October 2007, due to lack of academic rigour and teaching quality, along with generalized managerial and financial chaos in the institution.[74]\n\nMagalh\u00e3es computer[edit]\nA low-cost Intel Classmate PC-based netbook for use by children, announced and sponsored by S\u00f3crates' cabinet, named Magalh\u00e3es (after Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es), assembled by the Portuguese company J.P. S\u00e1 Couto, was at the centre of a controversy on 7 October 2008, when the company was suspected of \u20ac5\u00a0million worth of tax evasion.[75] J.P. S\u00e1 Couto dismissed all the accusations regarding alleged fiscal fraud within the company.[76] Other major controversy regarding Magalh\u00e3es computer were the legal issues about public contracting procedure in the agreement involving the Government and the company J.P. S\u00e1 Couto. The case led to an investigation that raised other similar issues involving other governmental agreements and public contracts.[77]\n\nFreeport outlet controversy[edit]\nSince 2005, and, especially again in 2009, it was suggested by some Portuguese and British media that Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates allegedly waived environmental restrictions, following intervention by one of his uncles and a cousin, to grant the British company Freeport a licence to build the Alcochete mall, a gigantic emporium near the Tagus river, developed in part on protected land outside Lisbon in 2002, when he was Minister for Environment of the PM Ant\u00f3nio Guterres cabinet.[78][79]\nPortuguese authorities have meanwhile insisted Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was not under investigation, nor was he a suspect, while UK's Serious Fraud Office refused to confirm the veracity of reports emanating in Portugal. Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates also stated the Freeport project was in due compliance with all legal requirements at the time.[80] J\u00falio Eduardo Coelho Monteiro, a businessman who is an uncle of Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, told the Portuguese newspaper Sol how he established contact between his nephew and Freeport's representatives.\nIn a DVD held by the British police and released in March 2009 by the Portuguese media, Charles Smith, a consultant hired to handle the licensing of the Freeport of Alcochete, clearly stated that Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates \"was corrupt\" and that he received, through a cousin, money to give the green light to the project for the \"outlet\". The recording revealed by TVI is only part of a conversation of 20 minutes that alongside Charles Smith also included John Cabral, an official of the consultant, and Alan Perkins, director of Freeport. It was the latter who, without knowledge of the other two, has recorded the event, where Smith and Cabral were questioned about the money that left the company to be used for the payment of \"gloves\" to the current Prime Minister. Charles Smith is one of two defendants in the case Freeport, commercial space on the process of Freeport Alcochete, related to alleged suspicions of corruption in the amendment to the Special Protection Area of the Tagus estuary (ZPET) decided three days before the elections of 2002, through a decree-law, when Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was Minister of Environment.\nThe conversation now revealed took place in 2006 with the aim of explaining the large outgoing amounts of money from the company's headquarters in London at the time of approval of the project. According to some sources contacted in London by TVI, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates remains the main suspect of British police. The British police are now set to send to the Portuguese authorities the 25 volumes of all research done in this process in England. The Serious Fraud Office, which investigates major financial fraud in Britain, has seen its activity limited due to the lack cooperation of the Portuguese authorities in investigating the case. The first official meeting took place only on 17 November 2008 in The Hague, the headquarters of Eurojust, a body which is designed to facilitate judicial cooperation in the EU. The judge C\u00e2ndida Almeida, director of DCIAP (Central Department for investigation and prosecution), which coordinates the department's prosecutor who investigates the case, refused a joint research proposal by the English. Then have taken note of the DVD. The prosecutor dropped the evidence, arguing that it was not in Portuguese law.[81]\nThe Eurojust tried to distance itself from the scandal involving its head, Jos\u00e9 da Mota, a Portuguese, who allegedly put pressure on prosecutors in order to stop a corruption probe involving Portuguese Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates. Two magistrates dealing with the so-called Freeport affair accused Jos\u00e9 Mota of having tried to persuade them to side-line the investigation at the request of the Portuguese premier and the minister of justice. The premier and Mr Mota's relationship goes back to the late nineties, when they worked in the same government as state secretaries for environment and justice respectively. In 2002, when the new EU body was formed (Eurojust), Mr Mota was transferred to The Hague as Portugal's representative to Eurojust. He was elected head of the judicial co-operation body in 2007, at a time when the so-called Freeport case had already started in Portugal.[82]\nOn 22 May 2012, Alan Perkins, a Freeport manager between 2005 and 2006, said, under oath in court, that illegal payments had been made to the minister of the Environment. At the time, the minister of the Environment was Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates.\n\nFace Oculta scandal[edit]\nMain article: Face Oculta\nAnother corruption case involving S\u00f3crates was the Face Oculta scandal. On 28 October 2009 the police began investigating a business group headquartered in Ovar. Armando Vara, one of the suspects, was reported to have had \"talks\" with S\u00f3crates. S\u00f3crates denied any involvement, claiming that he was only talking to a friend.[83]\nIn February 2011 the company TMN, that belongs to Portugal Telecom, claimed that, because of an informatics-related problem, all the information and data about the case and related to Armando Vara (ex-vice-president of BCP), Rui Pedro Soares (ex-manager of PT), M\u00e1rio Lino (ex-minister) and Paulo Penedos (ex-assistant of PT) had disappeared.[84] David Dinis, editor of the Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias newspaper, quit his job because of pressure from the director, Jo\u00e3o Marcelino, to stop this information being spread by the press.[85]\nSocrates was not indicted as part of the Face Oculta probe,[86] but investigation of corruption charges continued under Operation Marquis.[87]\n\nCorruption investigation[edit]\nIn November 2014, Jos\u00e9 Socrates was arrested on suspicions of corruption and money-laundering,[88] it having become apparent that a close friend was holding millions of euros for his benefit.  Socrates claimed that he merely borrowed money from his friend, but there were no records of the amounts loaned, which admittedly funded a luxurious lifestyle in Paris after Socrates left the government.[89] This came to light during the government's Operation Marquis investigation.[90] He was originally held pending the conclusion of this investigation.[91][92] Socrates was imprisoned in the jail at \u00c9vora until September 2015 when he was remanded to house arrest at a relative's house in Lisbon.[93][94][95] He was freed from house arrest in October 2015, but was constrained to remain in Portugal and prohibited from contacting other suspects in the case, pending completion of the investigation.[96][97] In 2017, Socrates was formally indicted on corruption charges including bribery, money laundering and tax fraud.[98]\nThe charges of document forgery, tax evasion, money laundering and misuse of political office were based upon three transactions:[99]\n\nSonae's takeover bid for Portugal Telecom and its proposed merger with Brazilian telecom operator Oi,\nthe Vale do Lobo expansion project, and\nthe development of a high-speed railway line.\nReferences and notes[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Ant\u00f3nio Guterres admite que via S\u00f3crates como seu sucessor no Governo\" [Ant\u00f3nio Guterres stated that he saw S\u00f3crates as his successor in the government].
