{"name": "Moses Ensheim", "content": "Moses Ensheim (1750\u20139 April 1839), also known as Brisac and Moses Metz, was a French-Jewish mathematician and Hebrew poet.\n Destined for the rabbinate by his parents, Ensheim left his native Metz against his father's will, and for many years led a wandering life. From 1782 to 1785 he was tutor in the family of Moses Mendelssohn in Berlin, having special charge over the education of Abraham Mendelssohn.[1] On leaving Mendelssohn's house he returned to Metz, where he struggled hard to make a living by teaching mathematics. Being a Jew, he was rejected for the position of professor of mathematics at the newly founded \u00c9cole centrale de Metz.\n Ensheim was a prominent member of the movement instituted by the Me'assefim. In 178[clarification needed], he published a volume of Hebrew riddles. In 1790, Ensheim published Shalosh \u1e24idot, a satire against billiards card card games, and two hymns: Al-ha-Va'ad ha-Gadol asher bi-medinat \u1e92arefat, addressed to the National Assembly in Versailles, and the triumphal song La-Mena\u1e93e'a\u1e25 Shir, which was sung in 1793 in the synagogue at Metz to the tune of La Marseillaise.[2]\n He was an intimate friend of Abb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire, and helped him with the preparation of his 1788 essay in defense of the Jews.
