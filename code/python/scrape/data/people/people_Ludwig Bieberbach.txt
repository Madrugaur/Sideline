{"name": "Ludwig Bieberbach", "content": "Ludwig Georg Elias Moses Bieberbach (German: [\u02c8bi\u02d0b\u0250\u02ccba\u03c7]; 4 December 1886 \u2013 1 September 1982) was a German mathematician and Nazi.[1]\n Born in Goddelau, near Darmstadt, he studied at Heidelberg and under Felix Klein at G\u00f6ttingen, receiving his doctorate in 1910.[2] His dissertation was titled On the theory of automorphic functions (German: Theorie der automorphen Funktionen). He began working as a Privatdozent at K\u00f6nigsberg in 1910 and as Professor ordinarius at the University of Basel in 1913. He taught at the University of Frankfurt in 1915 and the University of Berlin from 1921\u201345.\n Bieberbach wrote a habilitation thesis in 1911 about groups of Euclidean motions \u2013 identifying conditions under which the group must have a translational subgroup whose vectors span the Euclidean space \u2013 that helped solve Hilbert's 18th problem. He worked on complex analysis and its applications to other areas in mathematics. He is known for his work on dynamics in several complex variables, where he obtained results similar to Fatou's.  In 1916 he formulated the Bieberbach conjecture, stating a necessary condition for a holomorphic function to map the open unit disc injectively into the complex plane in terms of the function's Taylor series. In 1984 Louis de Branges proved the conjecture (for this reason, the Bieberbach conjecture is sometimes called de Branges' theorem). There is also a Bieberbach theorem\u00a0[ru] on space groups. In 1928 Bieberbach wrote a book with Issai Schur titled \u00dcber die Minkowskische Reduktiontheorie der positiven quadratischen Formen.\n Bieberbach was a speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held at Zurich in 1932.\n Bieberbach joined the Sturmabteilung in 1933 and the NSDAP in 1937. He was enthusiastically involved in the efforts to dismiss  his Jewish colleagues, including Edmund Landau and his former coauthor Schur, from their posts. He also facilitated the Gestapo arrests of some close colleagues, such as Juliusz Schauder. Bieberbach was heavily influenced by Theodore Vahlen, another German mathematician and anti-Semite, who along with Bieberbach founded the \"Deutsche Mathematik\" (\"German mathematics\") movement and journal of the same name. The purpose of the movement was to encourage and promote a \"German\" (in this case meaning intuitionistic) style in mathematics. Bieberbach's and Vahlen's idea of having German mathematics was only part of a wider trend in the scientific community in Nazi Germany towards giving the sciences racial character; there were also pseudoscientific movements for \"Deutsche Physik\", \"German chemistry\", and \"German biology\".  In 1945, Bieberbach was dismissed from all his academic positions because of his support of Nazism, but in 1949 was invited to lecture at the University of Basel by Ostrowski, who considered Bieberbach's political views irrelevant to his contributions to the field of mathematics.[3]\n \"\u2026 the spatial imagination is a characteristic of the Germanic races, while pure logical reasoning has a richer development among Romanic and  Hebraic races. \u2026 In the intellectual sphere the race shows in the manner of creation, the evaluation of the results, and I guess also in the standpoint considering foundational questions. \u2026 Formalism wants to build a realm of mathematical truths which is independent of man, whereas Intuitionism is based on the idea that mathematical thinking is a human endeavor and thus cannot be separated from man.\" (in Stilarten mathematischen Schaffens, i.e. Styles of mathematical creation/endeavour, p.\u00a0357).\n ", "tags": ["1886 births", "1982 deaths", "People from Riedstadt", "People from the Grand Duchy of Hesse", "Nazi Party members", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Heidelberg University alumni", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "University of K\u00f6nigsberg faculty", "University of Basel faculty", "Goethe University Frankfurt faculty", "Humboldt University of Berlin faculty", "Members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences", "Mathematicians involved with Mathematische Annalen", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles lacking in-text citations from January 2015", "All articles lacking in-text citations", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing German-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\nThis article includes a list of general references, but it remains largely unverified because it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations.
