He was the first to suggest founding a Jewish National Fund for the purchase of land in Palestine.\n Zvi Hermann Schapira was born in a small Lithuanian town, Erswilken, not far from the larger town of Taurag\u0117,[2] part of the Russian Empire, but also close to the Prussian border.[3] After studying for the rabbinate, Schapira was first appointed rabbi at age twenty-four, but then decided to dedicate his life to the secular sciences.[2] He first moved to Odessa, and in 1868 to Berlin, where he enrolled for three years at the Gewerbeakademie\u00a0[de].[2] Schapira returned to Odessa, where he worked as a merchant for the next five years.[2]\n In 1878 he switched back to scientific studies, spending the next four years in the German university town of Heidelberg where he especially concentrated on mathematics and physics.[2] In 1880, he applied for a PhD examination, with mathematics as a main subject and mechanics and Hebrew Language and Literature as secondary subjects.[3] That same year, with Lazarus Fuchs as thesis advisor, he earned his doctorate with the dissertation Lineare homogene Cofunktionen, \"Linear homogeneous cofunctions\".[3] In 1883 he established himself as Privatdozent in mathematics at the University of Heidelberg, becoming assistant professor in 1887.[3] Schapira published his mathematical work in a number of specialised journals.[2]\n Throughout his life, Schapira remained a student of Hebrew literature, contributing an edition of the Mishnat ha-Middot (1880) based on a Munich manuscript.[2] He also wrote for the Hebrew periodicals Ha-Meli\u1e93, Ha-\u1e92efirah, and Mi-Mizra\u1e25 umi-Ma'arab.[2]\n In the aftermath of the Russian pogroms of 1881, Schapira lent his support to the proto-Zionist Hibbat Zion movement.[4] In 1884, Schapira proposed the establishment of an organization for the acquisition of land in Eretz Yisrael and came up with the idea of the \"Blue Box\" as means of collecting money.[5] He presented proposal for the creation of a Jewish national fund at the First Zionist Congress of 1897,[4] where he supported the Basel program, proving to be an enthusiastic Zionist from the very beginning of the movement.[2] Although the Jewish National Fund (JNF) came into being only in 1901, at the Fifth Congress, after Shapira's death, he is still considered to be the \"father\" of the JNF.[6][4]\n Also at the 1987 congress, Shapira brought up the idea of founding a Hebrew university in Jerusalem.[7]\n During a Zionist lecture tour he contracted pneumonia in Cologne, and died there on 8 May 1898.[2]\n \u00a0This article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Singer, Isidore;  et\u00a0al., eds.
