{"name": "Terence Conran", "content": "\n Sir Terence Orby Conran CH RDI FCSD (4 October 1931 \u2013 12 September 2020) was an English designer, restaurateur, retailer, and writer.[1] He founded the Design Museum in London. The British designer Thomas Heatherwick said that Conran \"moved Britain forward to make it an influence around the world.\"[2] Edward Barber, from the British design team Barber & Osgerby, described Conran as \"the most passionate man in Britain when it comes to design, and his central idea has always been 'Design is there to improve your life.'\"[3] The satirist Craig Brown once joked that before Conran \"there were no chairs and no France.\"[4]\n Conran was born in Kingston upon Thames, the son of Christina Mabel Joan Conran (n\u00e9e Halstead, d.1968) and South African-born Gerard Rupert Conran (d.1986), a businessman who owned a rubber importation company in East London.[5] Conran was educated at Highfield School in Liphook, Bryanston School in Dorset and the Central School of Art and Design (now incorporated into Central St Martin's, a part of the University of the Arts, London), where he studied textiles and other materials. \n Conran's first professional work came when he worked in the Festival of Britain (1951) on the main South Bank site. He left college to take up a job with Dennis Lennon's architectural company, which had been commissioned to make a 1/4-scale interior of a Princess Flying Boat.[6]\n Conran started his own design practice in 1956 with the Summa furniture range and designing a shop for Mary Quant.\n In 1964, he opened the first Habitat shop in Chelsea, London with his third wife Caroline Herbert, focusing on housewares and furniture in contemporary designs. Habitat grew into a large chain, the first retailer to bring such designs to a mass audience.[7]\n In the mid-1980s, Conran expanded Habitat into the Storehouse plc group of companies that included BhS, Mothercare and Heal's but in 1990 he lost control of the company.\n His later retail companies[8] included the Conran Shop[9] and FSC-certified (Forest Stewardship Council) wood furniture maker Benchmark Furniture,[10] which he co-founded with Sean Sutcliffe in 1983.\n He was also involved in architecture and interior design, including establishing the architecture and planning consultancy Conran Roche with Fred Roche in 1980. Their projects include Michelin House (which he turned into the restaurant Bibendum) and the Bluebird Garage, both in Chelsea.[11] Conran had a major role in the regeneration in the early 1990s of the Shad Thames area of London next to Tower Bridge that includes the Design Museum. His business, Conran and Partners, is a design company comprising product, brand and interior designers and architects, working on projects all over the world. Conran designed furniture for Marks & Spencer, J. C. Penney, Content by Conran, Benchmark, and The Conran Shop.\n Conran's architecture and design practice also worked on projects in North America and Asia.[12] In 2009, he licensed the Conran Shop to a partner in Japan. In September 2014, Cassina IXC Ltd acquired the entire business of The Conran Shop in Japan[13] where it still thrives with four stores.[14] In 2019, the Conran Shop opened in Seoul, South Korea.[15][16]\n In 1997 he appeared as himself in \u201cIn the Smoke\u201d,  S5:E7 of Pie in the Sky.\n Besides Bibendum, Conran created many other restaurants in London[17] and elsewhere. In 2005, he was named as the most influential restaurateur in the UK by CatererSearch, the website of Caterer and Hotelkeeper magazine. In 2007, 49 percent of the restaurant business was sold to two former managers, who rebranded it as D&D London.[18]\n In 2008, he returned to the restaurant business on a personal basis by opening Boundary, a restaurant, bar, caf\u00e9, and meeting room complex in Shoreditch, East London. This was followed in 2009 by Lutyens, a restaurant and private club within the former Reuters building in Fleet Street London.[19] In 2018, Lutyens, together with two other related restaurants, closed as Conran's hospitality venture with Peter Prescott went into administration.[20]\n He wrote over 50 books which broadly reflect his design philosophy, selling over 25 million copies worldwide.[citation needed] The majority of these books were published by Conran Octopus, a division of Octopus Publishing Group, a cross-platform illustrated-book publisher founded by Conran and Paul Hamlyn.\n Conran was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 1983 New Year Honours and Companion of Honour (CH) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to design.[21][22]\n He was a winner of the Chartered Society of Designers Minerva Medal, the society's highest award.\n Between 2003 and 2011, Conran was provost of the Royal College of Art.\n In 2003, he received the Prince Philip Designers Prize in recognition of his lifetime achievements in design.[23]\n In 2010, Conran was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry by the Royal Society of Arts.[24]\n He won the Lifetime Achievement Award at The Catey Awards in 2017.\n In 2019, Conran was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by The Furniture Makers\u2019 Company, the City of London livery company and charity for the furnishing industry.[25]\n In 2007, he received an honorary degree from London South Bank University and, in August 2012, an honorary doctorate from the University of Pretoria.[26]\n In May 2012, he received an honorary professorship from the University for the Creative Arts.[27]\n Conran married architect Brenda Davison in 1952 at the age of 19; the marriage lasted six months. Conran married his second wife, journalist Shirley Pearce, in 1955 with whom he had two sons \u2013 Sebastian and Jasper \u2013 before they divorced in 1962. Conran married his third wife, cookery writer Caroline Herbert, the following year. The marriage lasted for 33 years and produced three children \u2013 Tom, Sophie, and Edmund \u2013 before ending in divorce in 1996.[28] His youngest son Edmund, known as Ned, had problems with drug and alcohol abuse and was remanded to custody in a psychiatric unit in 2001 following a sexual assault on a tourist in London. He has since recovered and become a restaurateur. Conran married his fourth wife, Victoria Davis, in 2000.[29][30]\n Sir Terence Conran died on 12 September 2020, at the age of 88.[31]\n ", "tags": ["1931 births", "2020 deaths", "20th-century British artists", "20th-century British businesspeople", "20th-century English non-fiction writers", "21st-century British artists", "21st-century British businesspeople", "21st-century English writers", "Alumni of the Central School of Art and Design", "Businesspeople from London", "Chartered designers", "Conran family", "English businesspeople in retailing", "English company founders", "English industrial designers", "English interior designers", "English male non-fiction writers", "English non-fiction writers", "English restaurateurs", "Fellows of Chartered Society of Designers", "Knights Bachelor", "Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour", "People associated with the Royal College of Art", "People educated at Bryanston School", "People from Chelsea, London", "People from Esher", "People from Kingston upon Thames", "People from Kintbury", "Product designers", "Restaurant founders", "Retail company founders", "Writers from London", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 Japanese-language sources (ja)", "Pages containing London Gazette template with parameter supp set to y", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from July 2015", "All articles needing additional references", "Use British English from July 2015", "Use dmy dates from August 2014", "Marriage template deprecations", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from July 2015", "National Portrait Gallery (London) person ID same as Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NGV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "British restaurateur and designer\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
