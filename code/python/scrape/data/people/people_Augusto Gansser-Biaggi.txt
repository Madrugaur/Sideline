{"name": "Augusto Gansser-Biaggi", "content": "Augusto Gansser-Biaggi (28 October 1910 \u2013 9 January 2012[1]) was a Swiss geologist who specialised in the geology of the Himalayas. He was born in Milan.\n His geological researches were global in scope:\n He got the Tibetan variant of malaria at the First Swiss Himalaya Expedition, and thereafter a lifelong resistance. He circumambulated Mount Kailash disguised as a pilgrim, discovering at the foot of the mountain the origin of one rock seen in the Indian part of the Himalayas and a sensation: seafloor rocks on its South side (ophiolites). Later on, he interpreted this Indus-Yarlung-Tsangpo Suture Zone (ISZ) as the border between the Indian and the Eurasian Plate.\n Iran: using his field notes and relief pictures taken by the Iranian Air Force, he chose a 50x 12\u00a0km area. Four drillings were not able to go through a huge salt and gypsum layer. Only Number 5 was successful, the largest known 'wildcat' oil gusher, North of Qom (Iran) on 26 August 1956 (3,000\u00a0m deep, 80,000\u00a0tons oil/day). The gas got lighted up on 13 September, sometime later the well closed itself.[2][3]\n From 1958 until 1977, he was professor of Geology at the University and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, from where he carried out several researches in the Himalayas (Nepal, India and Bhutan). There were five expeditions between 1963 and 1977 to Bhutan. In 1980 and 1985 he was invited by Deng Xiao Ping to Tibet.\n Notes: the Greenland expedition included Professor Eugen Wegmann (University of Neuch\u00e2tel), Swiss geologists Ren\u00e9 Masson and Eduard Wenk. The Bhutan expeditions were possible with the help of Jigme Dorje Wangchuks, King of Bhutan and his adviser Fritz von Schulthess.\n After the first Himalayan expedition he married Linda Biaggi (Toti) from Lugano. The family has two sons and four daughters: Ursula (1941), Mario (1943), Luca (1945), Manuela (1949), Francesca (1956), Rosanna (1959). He named Pico Toti, Sierra Nevada del Cocuy (Colombia) after his wife following their joint first ascent. She died in 2000 (Alzheimer's disease). Gansser-Biaggi turned 100 on 28 October 2010.[4]\n ", "tags": ["1910 births", "2012 deaths", "Wollaston Medal winners", "Swiss geologists", "Swiss centenarians", "Gustav-Steinmann-Medaille winners", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from October 2016", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Augusto Gansser-Biaggi9 July 1936, Augusto Gansser is back to India, disguised as a pilgrim.Born28 October 1910Milan, ItalyDied9 January 2012(2012-01-09) (aged\u00a0101)Massagno TI, SwitzerlandNationalitySwissAlma\u00a0materETH ZurichKnown\u00a0forGeology of the Himalayas (1964), Geology of Bhutan Himalaya (1983)AwardsGustav-Steinmann-Medaille (1982)Scientific careerFieldsgeology, petroleum geologyInstitutionsShell, National Iranian Oil CompanyProfessor of Geology, ETH Zurich (1958\u20131977)\n\nAugusto Gansser-Biaggi (28 October 1910 \u2013 9 January 2012[1]) was a Swiss geologist who specialised in the geology of the Himalayas.
