{"name": "Juan Carlos Wasmosy", "content": "\n Juan Carlos Wasmosy Monti (born December 15, 1938) was the president of Paraguay from August 15, 1993 until August 15, 1998. He was a member of the Colorado Party, and the country's first freely elected president, as well as the first civilian president in 39 years.\n Born in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, Wasmosy trained as a civil engineer and became head of the Paraguayan consortium working on the Itaipu Dam. During this project, he amassed a large amount of wealth. He served as minister of integration under President Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez.\n His ancestors D\u00e1niel V\u00e1mosy and J\u00f3zsef V\u00e1mosy, who changed his name into Wamosy, immigrated to South America from Debrecen, Hungary in 1828. At that time, the surname of the family was V\u00e1mosy. His relative, Alceu Wamosy (1895\u20131923), a famous Brazilian writer, is also from this ancestry. Juan Carlos Wasmosy went to see the home town of his ancestors in 1995 during his official visit to Hungary.\n Rodr\u00edguez endorsed Wasmosy as his successor in the 1993 elections. He won with approximately 40 percent of the vote in what is generally acknowledged to be the first honest election in the country's history (the country had gained independence in 1811), with Domingo Laino finishing a close second. Although there were confirmed cases of fraud, a team of international observers led by Jimmy Carter concluded that Wasmosy's margin of victory was large enough to offset any wrongdoing. Carter also noted that opposition candidates took 60 percent of the vote between them.[1] This was a remarkable figure given Paraguay's long history of autocratic rule. For most of the country's history, particularly during Alfredo Stroessner's 35-year dictatorship, the opposition was barely tolerated when it was even permitted at all. At the time of Stroessner's ouster in 1989, the country had only known two years of true democracy in its entire history.\n However, he became very unpopular when he appointed many of Stroessner's supporters to government posts. He also failed to continue the limited reforms of Rodr\u00edguez.\n Lino Oviedo, head of the Paraguayan army, allegedly attempted a coup in April 1996. Wasmosy countered by offering Oviedo a ministerial position, but soon imprisoned him. \n Wasmosy was barred from running again in 1998; in response to Stroessner's authoritarian excesses, the 1992 constitution barred any sort of reelection for the president. Ra\u00fal Cubas stood for the Colorado Party presidential nomination and won.\n In 2002, Wasmosy was convicted of defrauding the Paraguayan state and was himself sentenced to four years in prison.[2] The sentence was later appealed.\n ", "tags": ["1938 births", "Living people", "People from Asunci\u00f3n", "Presidents of Paraguay", "Civil engineers", "Paraguayan engineers", "Paraguayan people of Hungarian descent", "Prisoners and detainees of Paraguay", "Paraguayan prisoners and detainees", "Colorado Party (Paraguay) politicians", "Government ministers of Paraguay", "Paraguayan politicians convicted of crimes", "Grand Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Recipients of the Medal of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay", "Use mdy dates from April 2018", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Wasmosy and the second or maternal family name is  Monti.\nHis ExcellencyJuan Carlos Wasmosy44th President of ParaguayIn officeAugust 15, 1993\u00a0\u2013 August 15, 1998Vice President\u00c1ngel Roberto SeifartPreceded byAndr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguezSucceeded byRa\u00fal Cubas Grau\nPersonal detailsBorn (1938-12-15) December 15, 1938 (age\u00a082)Asuncion, ParaguayPolitical partyColorado Party\nJuan Carlos Wasmosy Monti (born December 15, 1938) was the president of Paraguay from August 15, 1993 until August 15, 1998.
