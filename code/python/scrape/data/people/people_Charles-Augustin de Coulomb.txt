{"name": "Charles-Augustin de Coulomb", "content": "Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (/\u02c8ku\u02d0l\u0252m, -lo\u028am, ku\u02d0\u02c8l\u0252m, -\u02c8lo\u028am/;[1] French:\u00a0[kul\u0254\u0303]; 14 June  1736 \u2013 23 August 1806) was a French military engineer and physicist. He is best known as the eponymous discoverer of what is now called Coulomb's law, the description of the electrostatic force of attraction and repulsion, though he also did important work on friction. \n The SI unit of electric charge, the coulomb, was named in his honor in 1880.[2]\n Charles-Augustin de Coulomb was born in Angoul\u00eame, Angoumois county, France, to Henry Coulomb, an inspector of the royal demesne originally from Montpellier, and Catherine Bajet. He was baptised at the parish church of St. Andr\u00e9. \nThe family moved to Paris early in his childhood, and he studied at Coll\u00e8ge Mazarin.\nHis studies included philosophy, language and literature. He also received a good education in mathematics, astronomy, chemistry and botany.\nWhen his father suffered a financial setback, he was forced to leave Paris, and went to Montpellier. Coulomb submitted his first publication to the Society of Sciences in Montpellier during this time. He went back to Paris and passed the exams for the \u00c9cole royale du g\u00e9nie de M\u00e9zi\u00e8res in 1760.\n He graduated in 1761 and joined the French army as an engineer in the rank of lieutenant.\nOver the next twenty years, he was posted to a variety of locations where he was involved in engineering: structural, fortifications, soil mechanics, as well as other fields of engineering. His first posting was to Brest but in February 1764 he was sent to Martinique, in the West Indies, where he was put in charge of building the new Fort Bourbon and this task occupied him until June 1772. His health suffered setbacks during the three years he spent in Martinique that would affect him for the rest of his life.\n On his return to France, Coulomb was sent to Bouchain. However, he now began to write important works on applied mechanics and he presented his first work to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in Paris in 1773. In 1779 Coulomb was sent to Rochefort to collaborate with the Marquis de Montalembert in constructing a fort made entirely from wood near \u00cele-d'Aix. During his period at Rochefort, Coulomb carried on his research into mechanics, in particular using the shipyards in Rochefort as laboratories for his experiments.\n Upon his return to France, with the rank of Captain, he was employed at La Rochelle, the Isle of Aix and Cherbourg. He discovered first an inverse relationship of the force between electric charges and the square of its distance and then the same relationship between magnetic poles. Later these relationships were named after him as Coulomb's law.\n In 1781, he was stationed at Paris. In 1787 with Tenon he visited the Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse and they were impressed by the revolutionary \"pavilion\" design and recommended it to the French government. On the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, he resigned his appointment as intendant des eaux et fontaines and retired to a small estate which he possessed at Blois. \n He was recalled to Paris for a time in order to take part in the new determination of weights and measures, which had been decreed by the Revolutionary government. He became one of the first members of the French National Institute and was appointed inspector of public instruction in 1802. His health was already very feeble and four years later he died in Paris.\n Coulomb leaves a legacy as a pioneer in the field of geotechnical engineering for his contribution to retaining wall design. His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.\n In 1784, his memoir Recherches th\u00e9oriques et exp\u00e9rimentales sur la force de torsion et sur l'\u00e9lasticit\u00e9 des fils de metal[3] (Theoretical research and experimentation on torsion and the elasticity of metal wire) appeared. This memoir contained the results of Coulomb's experiments on the torsional force for metal wires, specifically within a torsion balance. His general result is:\n the moment of the torque is, for wires of the same metal, proportional to the torsional angle, the fourth power of the diameter and the inverse of the length of the wire. In 1785, Coulomb presented his first three reports on electricity and magnetism:\n Il r\u00e9sulte donc de ces trois essais, que l'action r\u00e9pulsive que les deux balles \u00e9lectrif\u00e9es de la m\u00eame nature d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 exercent l'une sur l'autre, suit la raison inverse du carr\u00e9 des distances.\nTranslation:  It follows therefore from these three tests, that the repulsive force that the two balls \u2014 [which were] electrified with the same kind of electricity \u2014 exert on each other, follows the inverse proportion of the square of the distance. Four subsequent reports were published in the following years:\n Coulomb explained the laws of attraction and repulsion between electric charges and magnetic poles, although he did not find any relationship between the two phenomena. He thought that the attraction and repulsion were due to different kinds of fluids.\n Coulomb also made a significant contribution to the field of tribology. He completed the most comprehensive study of friction undertaken in the eighteenth century and was named as one of the 23 \"Men of Tribology\" by Duncan Dowson.[11]\n ", "tags": ["1736 births", "1806 deaths", "People from Angoul\u00eame", "French physicists", "Geotechnical engineers", "French civil engineers", "French Roman Catholics", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Metrologists", "Tribologists", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Articles with LibriVox links", "Articles containing French-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French physicist\nCharles-Augustin de CoulombPortrait by Louis Hierle in 1894Born(1736-06-14)14 June 1736Angoul\u00eame, Angoumois, FranceDied23 August 1806(1806-08-23) (aged\u00a070)Paris, FranceNationalityFrenchAlma\u00a0mater\u00c9cole royale du g\u00e9nie de M\u00e9zi\u00e8resKnown\u00a0forTorsion balanceCoulomb's lawCoulomb frictionCoulomb dampingMohr-Coulomb theory\nCharles-Augustin de Coulomb (/\u02c8ku\u02d0l\u0252m, -lo\u028am, ku\u02d0\u02c8l\u0252m, -\u02c8lo\u028am/;[1] French:\u00a0[kul\u0254\u0303]; 14 June  1736 \u2013 23 August 1806) was a French military engineer and physicist.
