{"name": "Manjul Bhargava", "content": "\n Manjul Bhargava FRS (born 8 August 1974)[2] is a Canadian-American mathematician. He is the Brandon Fradd, Class of 1983, Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University, the Stieltjes Professor of Number Theory[3] at Leiden University, and also holds Adjunct Professorships at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, and the University of Hyderabad. He is known primarily for his contributions to number theory.\n Bhargava was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014. According to the International Mathematical Union citation, he was awarded the prize \"for developing powerful new methods in the geometry of numbers, which he applied to count rings of small rank and to bound the average rank of elliptic curves\".[4][5][6]\n Bhargava was born to an Indian family in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, but grew up and attended school primarily in Long Island, New York. His mother Mira Bhargava, a mathematician at Hofstra University, was his first mathematics teacher.[7][8] He completed all of his high school math and computer science courses by age 14.[9] He attended Plainedge High School in North Massapequa, and graduated in 1992 as the class valedictorian. He obtained his B.A. from Harvard University in 1996. For his research as an undergraduate, he was awarded the 1996 Morgan Prize. Bhargava went on to pursue graduate studies at Princeton University, where he completed a doctoral dissertation titled \"Higher composition laws\" under the supervision of Andrew Wiles and received his Ph.D. in 2001, with the support of a Hertz Fellowship.[10] He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 2001\u201302,[11] and at Harvard University in 2002\u201303. Princeton appointed him as a tenured Full Professor in 2003. He was appointed to the Stieltjes Chair in Leiden University in 2010.\n Bhargava is also an accomplished tabla player, having studied under gurus such as Zakir Hussain.[12] He also studied Sanskrit from his grandfather Purushottam Lal Bhargava, a well-known scholar of Sanskrit and ancient Indian history.[13][14] He is an admirer of Sanskrit poetry.[15]\n His PhD thesis generalized Gauss's classical law for composition of binary quadratic forms to many other situations. One major use of his results is the parametrization of quartic and quintic orders in number fields, thus allowing the study of asymptotic behavior of arithmetic properties of these orders and fields.\n His research also includes fundamental contributions to the representation theory of quadratic forms, to interpolation problems and p-adic analysis, to the study of ideal class groups of algebraic number fields, and to the arithmetic theory of elliptic curves.[16] A short list of his specific mathematical contributions are:\n In 2015 Manjul Bhargava and Arul Shankar proved the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for a positive proportion of elliptic curves.[17]\n Bhargava has won several awards for his research, the most prestigious being the Fields Medal, the highest award in the field of mathematics, which he won in 2014.\n Bhargava was conferred a Fellowship at the Royal Society in 2019.[18]\n Bhargava is the third-youngest[19] full professor in Princeton University's history, after Charles Fefferman and John Pardon.\n In addition, he won the Morgan Prize[20] and Hertz Fellowship[21] in 1996, a Clay 5-year Research Fellowship, the Merten M. Hasse Prize from the MAA in 2003,[22] the Clay Research Award in 2005, and the Leonard M. and Eleanor B. Blumenthal Award for the Advancement of Research in Pure Mathematics in 2005.\n Peter Sarnak of Princeton University has said of Bhargava:[23]\n At mathematics he's at the very top end. For a guy so young I can't remember anybody so decorated at his age. He certainly started out with a bang and has not let it get to his head, which is unusual. Of course he couldn't do what he does if he wasn't brilliant. It's his exceptional talent that's so striking He was named one of Popular Science magazine's \"Brilliant 10\" in November 2002. He won the $10,000 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize, shared with Kannan Soundararajan, awarded by SASTRA in 2005 at Thanjavur, India, for his outstanding contributions to number theory.\n In 2008, Bhargava was awarded the American Mathematical Society's Cole Prize.[24] The citation reads:\n Bhargava's original and surprising contribution is the discovery of laws of composition on forms of higher degree. His techniques and insights into this question are dazzling; even in the case considered by Gauss, they lead to a new and clearer presentation of that theory In 2009, he was awarded the Face of the Future award at the India Abroad Person of the Year ceremony in New York City.[25] In 2014, the same publication, the most prestigious and most widely read of the diaspora publications, gave him a second prize, India Abroad Publisher's Prize for Special Excellence.[26]\n In 2011, he was awarded the Fermat Prize for \"various generalizations of the Davenport-Heilbronn estimates and for his startling recent results (with Arul Shankar) on the average rank of elliptic curves\".[27]\n In 2011, he delivered the Hedrick lectures of the MAA in Lexington, Kentucky.[28] He was also the 2011 Simons Lecturer at MIT.[29]\n In 2012, Bhargava was named an inaugural recipient of the Simons Investigator Award,[30] and became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society in its inaugural class of fellows.[31]\n He was awarded the 2012 Infosys Prize in mathematics for his \"extraordinarily original work in algebraic number theory, which has revolutionized the way in which number fields and elliptic curves are counted\".[32]\n In 2013, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[33]\n In 2014, Bhargava was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Seoul[14] for \"developing powerful new methods in the geometry of numbers, which he applied to count rings of small rank and to bound the average rank of elliptic curves\".[34]\n In 2015, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian award of India.[35]\n In 2017, Bhargava was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[36]\n In 2018 Bhargava was named as the inaugural occupant of The Distinguished Chair for the Public Dissemination of Mathematics at The National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath). This is the first visiting professorship in the United States dedicated exclusively to raising public awareness of mathematics.[37]\n ", "tags": ["1974 births", "Living people", "21st-century Indian mathematicians", "Canadian mathematicians", "Canadian people of Indian descent", "Clay Research Award recipients", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Foreign Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy", "Indian number theorists", "Fields Medalists", "Harvard University alumni", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Leiden University faculty", "Princeton University alumni", "Princeton University faculty", "Recipients of the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize", "People from Hamilton, Ontario", "People from North Massapequa, New York", "American academics of Indian descent", "Recipients of the Padma Bhushan in science & engineering", "Simons Investigator", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from August 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Canadian-American mathematician\n\n\nManjul BhargavaFRSManjul Bhargava in 2014Born (1974-08-08) 8 August 1974 (age\u00a046)Hamilton, Ontario, CanadaNationalityCanadaUnited StatesEducationHarvard University (AB)Princeton University (PhD)Known\u00a0forBhargava cube Bhargava factorial15 and 290 theoremsaverage rank of elliptic curvesAwardsFellow of the Royal Society (2019)Padma Bhushan (2015) Fields Medal (2014) Infosys Prize (2012)Fermat Prize (2011)Cole Prize (2008)Clay Research Award (2005)SASTRA Ramanujan Prize (2005)Blumenthal Award (2005) Hasse Prize (2003)Morgan Prize (1996)Hoopes Prize (1996)Hertz Fellowship (1996)Scientific careerInstitutionsPrinceton UniversityLeiden UniversityUniversity of HyderabadDoctoral advisorAndrew Wiles[1]Doctoral students\nWei Ho\nAlison Miller\nEvan O'Dorney\nMelanie Wood\n\nWebsitewww.math.princeton.edu/people/manjul-bhargava\nManjul Bhargava FRS (born 8 August 1974)[2] is a Canadian-American mathematician.
