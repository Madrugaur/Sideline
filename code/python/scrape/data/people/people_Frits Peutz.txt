Peutz (7 April 1896 \u2013 24 October 1974) was a Dutch (Limburgian) architect.\n Peutz was born in a Catholic family in Uithuizen in Groningen, a mostly Protestant province in the north of the Netherlands.

These playful features can be seen as a precursor to postmodernism, which is also visible in his Heerlen and Tegelen town halls.\n\n^ See also: Retraitehuis \u2013 Peutz Archived 2004-06-14 at the Wayback Machine\n\n^ See also: Historische foto's-Historical images of Heerlen \u2013 Parkstad1998 Archived 2005-02-19 at the Wayback Machine\n\n^ Historische foto's-Historical images of Heerlen \u2013 Parkstad1998 Archived 2005-02-19 at the Wayback Machine\n\n\nExternal links[edit]\nShort biography and pictures of Peutz' buildings\nMonseigneur Schrijnen Retreat House (in Dutch)\nSchunck Fashions' Building (the 'Glass Palace') (in Dutch)\nGallery[edit]\n\nSecular buildings in Heerlen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChurches in Limburg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouses in Limburg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Frits Peutz.\n\n\u2039\u00a0The template below (ACArt) is being considered for deletion.
