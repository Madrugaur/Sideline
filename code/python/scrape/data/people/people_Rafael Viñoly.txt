{"name": "Rafael Vi\u00f1oly", "content": "\n Rafael Vi\u00f1oly Beceiro (born 1944) is a Uruguayan architect.[1] He is the principal of Rafael Vi\u00f1oly Architects, which he founded in 1983, and has offices in New York City, Palo Alto, London, Manchester, Abu Dhabi and Buenos Aires.[2]\n Vi\u00f1oly was born in Montevideo, Uruguay to Rom\u00e1n Vi\u00f1oly Barreto (a film and theater director) and Maria Beceiro (a mathematics teacher).   He attended the University of Buenos Aires, receiving a Diploma in Architecture in 1968 and a Master of Architecture from the School of Architecture and Urbanism in 1969.\n In 1964, he formed the \"Estudio de Arquitectura Manteola-Petchersky-S\u00e1nchez G\u00f3mez-Santos-Solsona-Vi\u00f1oly\" architectural firm with six associates. This practice would eventually become one of the largest architectural practices in South America, completing many significant commissions in a very short time.\n In 1978, Vi\u00f1oly and his family relocated to the United States. For a brief period he served as a guest lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, settling permanently in New York City in 1979. He founded the firm Rafael Vi\u00f1oly Architects PC in 1983. His first major project in New York was the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, which was completed in 1988. In 1989, he won an international competition to design the Tokyo International Forum, which was completed in 1996. His firm's design was one of the finalists in the World Trade Center design competition.[3]\n During the course of his forty-plus year career, Vi\u00f1oly has practiced in the United States, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.[4]\n Vi\u00f1oly is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, an International Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and a member of the Japan Institute of Architects as well as the Sociedad Central de Arquitectos.[5]\n Major works by Vi\u00f1oly include 432 Park Avenue, 20 Fenchurch Street and the Curve Theatre.\n The building 20 Fenchurch Street in London won the 2015 Carbuncle Cup for its ugliness.[8]\n Two of the skyscrapers designed by Vi\u00f1oly, the Vdara in Las Vegas and 20 Fenchurch Street in London, have experienced unusual sun reflectivity problems due to their concave curved glass exteriors acting as respectively cylindrical and spherical reflectors for sunlight.  In 2010, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported that sunlight reflecting off the Vdara's south-facing tower could make swimmers in the hotel pool uncomfortably warm, as well as melt plastic cups and shopping bags; employees of the hotel referred to the phenomenon as the \"Vdara death ray\".[9] In London during the summer of 2013, sunlight reflecting off 20 Fenchurch Street melted parts on a parked automobile and also scorched the carpet of a nearby barber shop.[10]\n Notes\n Bibliography\n ", "tags": ["Rafael Vi\u00f1oly buildings", "American architects", "Argentine architects", "Uruguayan architects", "University of Buenos Aires alumni", "1944 births", "Living people", "Uruguayan emigrants to the United States", "Harvard University staff", "American people of Uruguayan descent", "People from Montevideo", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Use dmy dates from March 2020", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with autores.uy identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Vi\u00f1oly and the second or maternal family name is  Beceiro.\nUruguayan architect\nRafael Vi\u00f1oly BeceiroRafael Vi\u00f1olyBorn1944 (age\u00a076\u201377)Montevideo, UruguayAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Buenos AiresOccupationArchitectAwardsInternational Fellow, The Royal Institute of British Architects (2007), Medal of Honor, American Institute of Architects, New York Chapter (1995), National Academician, The National Academy (1994)PracticeRafael Vi\u00f1oly Architects PCBuildingsBrooklyn Children's MuseumTokyo International ForumThe Kimmel Center for the Performing ArtsDavid L.
