{"name": "Heinz Isler", "content": "Heinz Isler (July 26, 1926 \u2013 June 20, 2009) was a Swiss structural engineer. He is famous for his thin concrete shells.\n Heinz Isler was born in the municipality of Zollikon.[1] He showed talent as an artist as a student, but his father advised him to seek a career in engineering first. Isler studied thin concrete shells at the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich.\n Upon graduating from the ETH in 1950 with a degree in civil engineering, Isler worked as a teaching assistant with Pierre Lardy, a professor at the ETH, from 1951 to 1953. He opened his own office in 1954 in Burgdorf, Switzerland. His first project as a shellbuilder was a concert hall roof for the Hotel Kreuz in Langenthal which was completed between 1954 and 1955. The form of the shell was loosely inspired by the shape of a plumped-up pillow on his bed.[1]\n Isler died from a stroke on June 20, 2009 at the age of 82.[1]\n \n ", "tags": ["1926 births", "2009 deaths", "ETH Zurich alumni", "Swiss civil engineers", "Structural engineers", "People from Meilen District", "Articles needing additional references from April 2013", "All articles needing additional references", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For the Swiss cyclist, see Heinz Isler (cyclist).\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
