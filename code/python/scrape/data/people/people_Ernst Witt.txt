{"name": "Ernst Witt", "content": "Ernst Witt (26 June 1911 \u2013 3 July 1991) was a German mathematician, one of the leading algebraists of his time.\n Witt was born on the island of Alsen, then a part of the German Empire. Shortly after his birth, his parents moved the family to China, and he did not return to Europe until he was nine.\n After his schooling, Witt went to the University of Freiburg and the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He joined the NSDAP (Nazi Party) and was an active party member.[1] Witt completed his Ph.D. at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1934 with Emmy Noether and later became a lecturer. He was then a member of a team led by Helmut Hasse. During World War II he joined a group of five mathematicians, recruited by Wilhelm Fenner, and which included Georg Aumann, Alexander Aigner, Oswald Teichm\u00fcller, Johann Friedrich Schultze and their leader professor Wolfgang Franz, to form the backbone of the new mathematical research department in the late 1930s, which would eventually be called: Section IVc of Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht (abbr. OKW/Chi).[2][3]\n From 1937 until 1979, he taught at the University of Hamburg. He died in Hamburg in 1991, shortly after his 80th birthday.\n Witt's work has been highly influential. His invention of the Witt vectors clarifies and generalizes the structure of the p-adic numbers. It has become fundamental to p-adic Hodge theory.\n Witt was the founder of the theory of quadratic forms over an arbitrary field. He proved several of the key results, including the Witt cancellation theorem. He defined the Witt ring of all quadratic forms over a field, now a central object in the theory.\n The Poincar\u00e9\u2013Birkhoff\u2013Witt theorem is basic to the study of Lie algebras. In algebraic geometry, the Hasse\u2013Witt matrix of an algebraic curve over a finite field determines the cyclic \u00e9tale coverings of degree p of a curve in characteristic p.\n In the 1970s, Witt claimed that in 1940 he had discovered what would eventually be named the \"Leech lattice\" many years before John Leech discovered it in 1965, but Witt did not publish his discovery and the details of exactly what he did are unclear; see his collected works (Witt 1998, pp.\u00a0328\u2013329).\n ", "tags": ["20th-century German mathematicians", "Algebraists", "1911 births", "1991 deaths", "German cryptographers", "Articles needing additional references from November 2017", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.
