{"name": "Marie Gernet", "content": "\nMarie Gernet (1 October 1865 \u2013 1924) was a German mathematician who in 1895 became the second woman to obtain a doctorate at Heidelberg University. The first was K\u00e4the Windscheid, who earned a doctorate for her work on English pastoral poetry in the previous year.[1][2][3] Gernet was also the first native German woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics, 13 years earlier than Emmy Noether.[4] She was the only German among the first eight women to earn a mathematics Ph.D. in Germany.[5]\n Gernet was born in Ettlingen; her father was an army surgeon.\nShe earned a teaching qualification in 1883, and continued to study mathematics privately. In 1888, the Karlsruhe Gro\u00dfherzogliche Technische Hochschule accepted her as a special student, and she studied science there until 1891.[4] In that year, both she and Ruth Gentry applied for graduate study at Heidelberg, but were rejected.  The mathematics and science faculty of the university proposed a rule change to allow women to take individual study programs, but the university senate again rejected this change.[2] However, the Baden Ministry of Education overruled the senate and approved the change, allowing Gernet to study at Heidelberg.[2][4] There, she performed research on hyperelliptic integrals with Leo K\u00f6nigsberger. She failed her first oral examination for the doctorate in November 1894, but continued her studies and passed on the second attempt in July 1895.[4]\n After earning her doctorate, Gernet returned to the H\u00f6here T\u00f6chterschule in Karlsruhe, where she had studied as a girl. It soon became upgraded to a gymnasium, and continues to exist (rebuilt after World War II, and co-educational since 1973) as the Lessing-Gymnasium Karlsruhe\u00a0[de]. She remained there as a teacher and academic administrator until her retirement.[4]\n ", "tags": ["1865 births", "1924 deaths", "20th-century German mathematicians", "German women mathematicians", "Heidelberg University alumni", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from August 2019", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\n\nMarie Gernet (1 October 1865 \u2013 1924) was a German mathematician who in 1895 became the second woman to obtain a doctorate at Heidelberg University.
