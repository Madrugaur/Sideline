{"name": "Kengo Kuma", "content": "Kengo Kuma (\u9688 \u7814\u543e, Kuma Kengo, born 1954) is a Japanese architect and professor in the Department of Architecture (Graduate School of Engineering) at the University of Tokyo. Frequently compared to contemporaries Shigeru Ban and Kazuyo Sejima, Kuma is also noted for his prolific writings. He is the designer of the Japan National Stadium in Tokyo which has been built for 2020 Summer Olympics.[1]\n Kuma was born in Kanagawa, and attended Eiko Gakuen junior and senior high schools. After graduating in Architecture from the University of Tokyo in 1979, he worked for a time at Nihon Sekkei and Toda Corporation. He then moved to New York City for further studies at Columbia University as a visiting researcher from 1985 to 1986.[citation needed]\n In 1987, Kuma founded the Spatial Design Studio, and in 1990, he established his own firm, Kengo Kuma & Associates. He has taught at Columbia University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Keio University, where in 2008, Kuma was awarded a Ph.D. in architecture.[2] As a professor at the Graduate School of Architecture at the University of Tokyo, he runs a variety of research projects concerning architecture, urbanism and design within his laboratory, Kuma Lab.[3] Kengo Kuma & Associates employs over 150 architects in Tokyo and Paris, designing projects of diverse type and scale throughout the world.\n Kuma's stated goal is to recover the tradition of Japanese buildings and to reinterpret these traditions for the 21st century. In 1997, he won the Architectural Institute of Japan Award and in 2009 was made an Officier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France. Kuma lectures extensively and is the author of numerous books and articles discussing and criticizing approaches in contemporary architecture. His seminal text Anti-Object: The Dissolution and Disintegration of Architecture written in 2008, calls for an architecture of relations, respecting its surroundings instead of dominating them. Kuma's projects maintain a keen interest in the manipulation of light with nature through materiality.\n Although remaining in continuity with Japanese traditions with the clarity of structural solutions, implied tectonics, and importance of light and transparency, Kuma does not restrain himself to the banal and superficial use of \u2018light\u2019 materials. Instead, he goes much deeper, extending to the mechanisms of composition to expand the possibilities of materiality.  He utilizes technological advancements which can challenge unexpected materials, such as stone, into providing the same sense of lightness and softness as glass or wood. Kuma attempts to attain a sense of spatial immateriality as a consequence of the \u2018particulate nature\u2019 of the light and establishing a relationship between a  space and the natural round[clarification needed] around it.[4]\n Describing his practice, Kuma said \u201cYou could say that my aim is \u2018to recover the place\u2019. The place is a result of nature and time; this is the most important aspect. I think my architecture is some kind of frame of nature. With it, we can experience nature more deeply and more intimately. Transparency is a characteristic of Japanese architecture; I try to use light and natural materials to get a new kind of transparency.\u201d [5]\n In many of Kuma\u2019s projects, attention is focused on the connection spaces; on the segments between inside and outside, and one room to the next. The choice of materials stems not so much from an intention to guide the design of the forms, but to conform to the existing surroundings from a desire to compare similar materials, yet show the technical advances that have made possible new uses.\n When dealing with stone work, for example, Kuma displays a different character from the preexisting buildings of solid, heavy, traditional masonry construction. Instead his work surprises the eye by slimming down and dissolving the walls in an effort to express a certain \u201clightness\u201d and immateriality, suggesting an illusion of ambiguity and weakness not common to the solidity of stone construction.[5]\n In parallel, Kuma showed material innovation to support local traditional craftsmanship through his works. Collaborating with Japanese craftsmen specialized in wood, earth or paper, he helped maintaining the associated building techniques while modernizing them, bringing his know-how in modularity. This work led Kuma to win a Global Award for Sustainable Architecture in 2016.[6]\n Key projects include the Suntory Museum of Art in Tokyo, Bamboo Wall House in China, LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy) Group's Japan headquarters, Besan\u00e7on Art Center in France, and one of the largest spas in the Caribbean for Mandarin Oriental Dellis Cay.[7]\n Stone Roof, a private residence in Nagano, Japan, built in 2010, consists of a roof which is meant to spring from the ground, providing a complete enclosure to the home. A local stone was chosen to intimately relate itself to the preexisting natural environment of the mountain side. The exterior stone work is made light and airy by cutting each stone into thin slices and bracing each slice as a pivoting panel. In this way, the heavy quality of stone is diluted and provides the eye with an illusion of lightness, allowing light and air directly into the space within. With this choice of material and construction, a new kind of transparency emerges; one that not only frames nature the way a glass curtain wall would, but also deeply relates itself to the mountain side.[8]\n In 2016, Kuma also delved into designing pre-fabricated pavilions in partnership with Revolution Precrafted. He designed the mobile multifunctional pavilion named The Aluminum Cloud Pavilion. The structure, composed of aluminum panels joined using Kangou technique, can be used as a teahouse or a space of meditation.[9]\n As a part of the TIME-SPACE-EXISTENCE video interview series Kengo Kuma collaborated with the European Cultural Centre to create a video documentation discussing the topics Time Space and Existence.\n Kuma Lab is a Research Laboratory headed by Kuma based in the Department of Architecture, Faculty of Engineering at the University of Tokyo's Hongo Campus that was started in 2009.[3]  In 2012, Kuma Lab published the book Patterns and Layering, Japanese Spatial Culture, Nature and Architecture, including the research from various Doctoral Candidate Lab members.[10]\n Its research topics consist of a comprehensive survey of architectural, urban, community, landscape, and product designs; survey of structural, material, and mechanical designs; and methodology for bridging sustainable, physical, and information designs. Its activities include participation in architectural design competitions, organization and management of regional and international design workshop, joint research with other departments at the University of Tokyo, and research and proposal to aid the recovery from the Great East Japan earthquake.\n Doric building, Minato-ku, Tokyo\n LVMH Group Japan headquarters, Osaka\n Asakusa Culture Tourism Center, Taito-ku, Tokyo\n Garden Terrace Hotel, Nagasaki\n Sunny Hills by Kengo Kuma\n Cit\u00e9 des Arts et de la Culture, Besan\u00e7on\n ", "tags": ["Kengo Kuma buildings", "Japanese architects", "People from Yokohama", "University of Tokyo alumni", "University of Tokyo faculty", "Keio University alumni", "Keio University faculty", "Columbia University alumni", "Officiers of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres", "1954 births", "Living people", "Prix Versailles-winning architects and designers", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "CS1 errors: missing title", "CS1 errors: bare URL", "CS1 Japanese-language sources (ja)", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Japanese-language text", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from December 2015", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from March 2017", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Japanese architect\nKengo Kuma\u9688 \u7814\u543eKengo Kuma in 2014Born1954 (age\u00a066\u201367)Yokohama, JapanAlma\u00a0mater\nUniversity of Tokyo\nColumbia University\nOccupationArchitect\nKengo Kuma (\u9688 \u7814\u543e, Kuma Kengo, born 1954) is a Japanese architect and professor in the Department of Architecture (Graduate School of Engineering) at the University of Tokyo.
