{"name": "Margaret Hutchinson Rousseau", "content": "\n Margaret Hutchinson Rousseau (27 October 1910 \u2013 12 January 2000) was an American chemical engineer who designed the first commercial penicillin production plant.[1][2] She was the first female member of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.[3]\n Hutchinson was born in 1910 in Houston, Texas, the daughter of a clothing store owner. She received her Bachelor of Science degree from Rice Institute in 1932 and her Doctor of Science degree in chemical engineering from MIT in 1937, the first woman to earn a doctorate in the subject in the USA.[4] Her thesis topic was The effect of solute on the liquid film resistance in gas absorption.[2]\n On 1 May 1939, she married William Caubu Rousseau, a co-worker at E.B. Badger & Sons, who was later a chemical engineering lecturer at MIT. They had one son, William.[citation needed]\n She died 12 January 2000, aged 89, at her home in Weston, Massachusetts.[4]\n Hutchinson started her professional career with E. B. Badger in Boston.  During the Second World War, she oversaw the design of production plants for the strategically important materials of penicillin and synthetic rubber.[5] Her development of deep-tank fermentation of penicillium mold enabled large-scale production of penicillin.[2][6] She worked on the development of high-octane gasoline for aviation fuel.[2] Her later work included improved distillation column design and plants for the production of ethylene glycol and glacial acetic acid.[5]\n Hutchinson retired in 1961, and later became an overseer of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.[7]\n In 1945, Hutchinson became the first woman to be accepted as a member of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.[8][3] In 1955 she received the Achievement Award of the Society of Women Engineers.[7][9] In 1983 she was the first female recipient of the prestigious Founders Award of the AIChE.[3]\n ", "tags": ["1910 births", "2000 deaths", "Disease-related deaths in Massachusetts", "Rice University alumni", "MIT School of Engineering alumni", "People from Houston", "American chemical engineers", "American women engineers", "Fellows of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers", "20th-century American engineers", "People from Weston, Massachusetts", "CS1: long volume value", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from March 2020", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from January 2017", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "American chemical engineer\n\n\n Margaret Hutchinson Rousseau\nMargaret Hutchinson Rousseau (27 October 1910 \u2013 12 January 2000) was an American chemical engineer who designed the first commercial penicillin production plant.[1][2] She was the first female member of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Career\n3 Honors\n4 References\n5 Images\n\n\nLife[edit]\nHutchinson was born in 1910 in Houston, Texas, the daughter of a clothing store owner.
