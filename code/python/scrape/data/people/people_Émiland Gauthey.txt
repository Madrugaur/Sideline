{"name": "\u00c9miland Gauthey", "content": "\u00c9miland Marie Gauthey ((1732-12-03)3 December 1732 in Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne \u2013 (1806-07-14)14 July 1806 in Paris[1]) was a French mathematician, civil engineer and architect. As an engineer for the \u00c9tats de Bourgogne (English: States of Burgundy), he was the creator of a great deal of the region's civil infrastructure, such as the Canal du Centre between Digoin and Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne (1784\u20131793), bridges including those at Navilly (1782\u20131790) and Gueugnon (1784\u20131787), and buildings such as the Eglise Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul (\"Church of St Peter and St Paul\") at Givry (Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire) (1772\u00a0\u2013 1791) and the theatre at Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne.\n Gauthey became Chief Engineer of the \u00c9tats de Bourgogne in 1782, on the death of his predecessor and close collaborator, Thomas Dumorey. After the French Revolution, he held several important posts in the Haute administration des Ponts-et Chauss\u00e9es (\"High Commission for Bridges and [High]ways\") in Paris. He was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1804 on its creation by Napoleon Bonaparte. From 1805 until his death, he was the highest-ranked engineer in France.\n \u00c9miland Marie Gauthey was born at Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne on 3 December 1732 into a provincial petty bourgeois family. His father, Pierre Gauthey, was the local doctor: and his mother, Louise (or Louyse) n\u00e9e was born at Chagny on 27 August 1700 as the dauter of Emiland Lafouge, a company lawyer and Official Receiver for the salt store in Toulon-sur-Arroux.\n From 1740 to 1748, he studied with brilliance at the Jesuit college in Chalon. At the age of sixteen, after his father died, he continued his studies at Versailles under the auspices of an uncle who was Professor of Mathematics at the \u00c9cole des pages du roi (English: School for Royal Pages).\n He continued his education under the architect Gabriel Dumont before entering the \u00c9cole royale des ponts et chauss\u00e9es (which became the \u00c9cole nationale des ponts et chauss\u00e9es, literally \"National School of Bridges and [High]Ways\"), which had been newly created and was under the direction of the notable engineer Jean-Rodolphe Perronet. He met with the Dumont[clarification needed] architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot, and started a lifelong friendship. He consulted Soufflot on the construction of the dome of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve, which became the Panth\u00e9on.\n Graduating in 1758, he was awarded the post of deputy engineer at Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, under Thomas Dumorey. He would wait twenty-four years, until Dumorey's death in 1782, to become the Chief Engineer of the \u00c9tats de Bourgogne (States of Burgundy) and to makeDijon his home. Shortly after, he was named Director.General of Burgundy Canals (French: Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des canaux de Bourgogne) in 1783.\n A brilliant technician, he was an exponent of the spirit of the Age of Enlightenment and of the Encyclop\u00e9die ou Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers (\"Encyclopaedia or Rational Dictionary of Sciences, Arts and Crafts\"), as evidenced by his investigative Essay on Philosophical Language (French: Essai sur la langue philosophique) of 1774 \u2013 in which he envisages a kind of language of universal graphical signs like stenography \u2013; and in his use of scientific advances in the building trade. His monumental works on building, M\u00e9moire sur l\u2019application de principes de m\u00e9canique de la construction des vo\u00fbtes et des D\u00f4mes (\"On the application of mechanical principles in the construction of vaults and domes\") and M\u00e9moire sur les canaux de navigation (\"On Navigation Canals\") posthumously published by his nephew, became standard reference works.\n His civil engineering works, such as the bridges of Gueugnon, Navilly and Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, helped to transform transportation methods and accelerated the Industrial Revolution in 19th-century Burgundy. It was in this forward-looking spirit that he participated in improving river navigation and building canals. He collaborated in the project to build a canal in Burgundy between the River Yonne and River Sa\u00f4ne (completed much later, in 1832) and he puis se consacre au canal de Franche-Comt\u00e9 de Saint-Jean-de-Losne/Saint-Symphorien-sur-Sa\u00f4ne \u00e0 Dole (also known as the French: Liaison Sa\u00f4ne-Doubs): this part of the project to connect the River Rhine with the River Rh\u00f4ne, built between 1783 and 1803, is also known as the French: canal de Monsieur because it was opened by Louis V Joseph de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9, lately Prince and Governor of Burgundy.[2]\n But his master work, \"The greatest public work of the 18th Century\",[3] was the Canal du Centre (or \"Canal du Charolais\"), (built 1783\u20131793) between Digoin and Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. Over 112\u00a0km (70\u00a0mi) with 62 locks, it connected the River Loire to the River Sa\u00f4ne, thus creating the primary route for boats from the English Channel to the Mediterranean Sea (the River Loire having been connected to the River Seine by the Canal de Briare).\n Gauthey remained interested in development in Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, his home town, where he rebuilt the quayside and built a theatre. These constructions are among many examples of neoclassical style in the area, including the dome of the pharmacy in the town, the churches at Givry and Louhans, the town hall at Tournus and the Ch\u00e2teau de Clermont-Montoison at Chagny.\n Changes after the French Revolution brought \u00c9miland Gauthey honours and high office: he was named the first Inspecteur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es in 1791. At the age of 60 he moved to Paris, married his cousin and adopted his nephew Claude-Louis Navier, one of the most brilliant mathematicians and engineers of the early 19th century. in 1801 he became a member of the Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des ponts et chauss\u00e9es en 1801 and in 1805 its vice-president. He worked on Somme-Escaut link and several developments in Paris, such as a new water supply which would become the Canal de l'Ourcq), and projects on the Seine bridges and the Passerelle des Arts, built by Jacques Dillon.\n The French Consulate awarded him the civil L\u00e9gion d'honneur on its first issue on 1804, and he was to be promoted to Commander but died suddenly, in Paris, on (1806-07-14)14 July 1806. Perhaps surprisingly, his place of death is unknown, but it is likely to be in a Parisian cemetery.\n ", "tags": ["18th-century French mathematicians", "French civil engineers", "18th-century French architects", "1732 births", "1806 deaths", "\u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech alumni", "Corps des ponts", "People from Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne", "French bridge engineers", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing French-language text", "Articles containing explicitly cited English-language text", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from October 2015", "Articles needing additional references from October 2015", "All articles needing additional references", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with suppressed authority control identifiers"], "raw": "\u00c9miland Marie GautheyNew alphabet devised by GautheyBorn(1732-12-03)3 December 1732Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, Burgundy, FranceDied14 July 1806(1806-07-14) (aged\u00a073)Paris, FranceNationalityFrenchEducation\u00c9cole des pages du Roi\u00c9cole nationale des ponts et chauss\u00e9esOccupationEngineerEngineering careerDisciplineCivil engineeringEmployer(s)\u00c9tats de BourgogneProjectsCanal du CentreAwardsLegion d'Honneur (1804)\n\n\u00c9miland Marie Gauthey ((1732-12-03)3 December 1732 in Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne \u2013 (1806-07-14)14 July 1806 in Paris[1]) was a French mathematician, civil engineer and architect.
