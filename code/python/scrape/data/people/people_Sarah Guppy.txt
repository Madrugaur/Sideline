{"name": "Sarah Guppy", "content": "\n Sarah Guppy, n\u00e9e Beach (5 November 1770 \u2013 24 August 1852) was an English inventor and the first woman to patent a bridge, in 1811. She developed a range of other domestic and marine products.[1]\n Following the publication of an erroneous entry in the ONDB in 2016, now corrected[2] Guppy has in recent times been incorrectly credited with the design of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge. She patented her ideas for a chain bridge in 1811 (before the announcement of the first competition for a bridge across the Avon Gorge) but this design was never realised. [3] Brunel\u2019s winning design for a bridge across the Avon Gorge differed from Guppy's patent in several significant ways: it had a deck suspended from flat wrought iron bar links rather than resting on top of chains like Guppy's; and it did not feature riverbed foundations (a key component of Guppy's design) as it was constructed on rock, 75 metres above high tide where the piers were not at risk of damage from water erosion. [4]\n Sarah Maria Beach was born in Birmingham, England, and baptised in November 1770 as a daughter of Richard and Mary Beach.[5]  She married Samuel Guppy in 1795. In 1811 she patented the first of her inventions, a method of making safe piling for bridges. Thomas Telford asked her for permission to use her patented design for suspension bridge foundations, and she granted it to him free of charge.[6] As a friend of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his family she became involved in the Great Western Railway, writing to the directors with ideas and giving her support. In 1841 she wrote a letter recommending planting willows and poplars to stabilise embankments. She continued to offer technical advice despite the fact that, as she wrote, \"it is unpleasant to speak of oneself\u2014it may seem boastful particularly in a woman.\"[7]\n The family took out 10 patents in the first half of the nineteenth century, including a method of keeping ships free of barnacles that led to a government contract worth \u00a340,000. Other inventions included a bed with built-in exercise equipment, a device for a tea or coffee urn which would cook eggs in the steam as well as having a small dish to keep toast warm, and a device for \"improvements in caulking ships, boats and other vessels.\" In later life she wrote The Cottagers and Labourers Friend and Dialogues for Children, invented the fire hood or Cook's Comforter, and patented a new type of candlestick that enabled candles to burn longer.[8][9]\n After marrying Bristol merchant Samuel Guppy they lived in Queen Square and Prince Street,[10] a leading light of the Bristol and Clifton social scene. The couple had six children, including Thomas Richard, who with older brother Samuel operated the Friars Sugar Refinery in Bristol (1826\u201342) before becoming an engineer and associate of Brunel, contributing significantly to the design of SS Great Western and SS Great Britain. Brunel painted a portrait of the younger Sarah Guppy c. 1836.[11]\n In 1837 the widowed Sarah, now 67, married Richard Eyre Coote, 28 years her junior. For a while they lived at Arnos Court, Brislington, but Richard ran through his rich wife's money at a rapid rate, spending on horses and neglecting her. Sarah moved into 7 Richmond Hill, Clifton, in 1842. She bought the land opposite the house for the benefit of Clifton residents and it still remains green space.[12]\n ", "tags": ["English civil engineers", "British bridge engineers", "Structural engineers", "People of the Industrial Revolution", "British railway civil engineers", "English inventors", "Women inventors", "British women engineers", "1770 births", "1852 deaths", "People from Birmingham, West Midlands", "19th-century inventors", "19th-century English businesspeople", "People from Clifton, Bristol", "Engineers from the West Midlands (county)", "19th-century English businesswomen", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the ODNB", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "EngvarB from December 2017", "Use dmy dates from December 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "English inventor\n\n\nSarah GuppyStencil by Stewy from a portrait by Isambard Kingdom BrunelBornSarah Maria Beach5.
