He is best known for his popular works on North American birds. He authored more than fifty works, usually writing as John K. Terres.\n He was born in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and spent his early years in New Jersey. He was educated at State Teachers College (Indiana, Pennsylvania), Cornell University and New York University. In 1986, he received an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of North Carolina. He received the John Burroughs Medal (1971) for From Laurel Hill to Siler's Bog, which detailed his explorations of Mason Farm Biological Reserve, part of the North Carolina Botanical Garden. Terres served as Editor of Audubon Magazine for twelve years (1948-1960).\n He died shortly before his 101st birthday in 2006.[1]\n He was a contributing editor of Birder's World magazine, culminating with an article about American Crow behavior observations of his own, plus his own watercolors of crows performing the behaviors in the text. He died with the wish of revising his 1980 Audubon Encyclopedia of North American Birds, about which Roger Tory Peterson said never left his desk side. Birder's World published, before the crow article, a story about him, with a photograph of him at the University of North Carolina\u2014Chapel Hill biological station, with much concentration examining a specimen.\n ", "tags": ["1905 births", "2006 deaths", "American ornithologists", "American naturalists", "John Burroughs Medal recipients", "American centenarians", "Writers from Philadelphia", "Writers from New Jersey", "Indiana University of Pennsylvania alumni", "American nature writers", "20th-century zoologists", "20th-century naturalists", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "John Kenneth Terres (December 17, 1905 \u2013 December 8, 2006), was an American naturalist and author.
