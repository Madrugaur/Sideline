{"name": "Friedrich B\u00f6hm", "content": "\n Friedrich B\u00f6hm (* 15 August 1885 in Harburg (Swabia) near Donauw\u00f6rth, died 25 August 1965 in Munich) was a German actuarial and insurance mathematician and university lecturer.[1] During World War II, B\u00f6hm was conscripted into Group IV of Inspectorate 7 (German: Horchleistelle), an early cipher bureau and Signals intelligence agency of the German Army (Wehrmacht) (German: Heer), working to decode foreign Ciphers. He would later work in the successor organization: General der Nachrichtenaufkl\u00e4rung, in a similar role.\n Friedrich B\u00f6hm studied mathematics at the Gymnasium St. Anna in Augsburg, Munich.  In 1908 he undertook his promotion to Dr Phil with a thesis titled: Parabolic metric in the hyperbolic space. Lindemann, who had already given lectures on Actuarial mathematics in Munich, drew his attention to questions of mortality and disability. In 1911, he enabled B\u00f6hm's Habilitation in this discipline. B\u00f6hm became a private lecturer and, following the example of the University of G\u00f6ttingen ( Georg Bohlmann ), founded a seminar on statistics and the insurance industry.[1] During the 1911-12 winter term, he began delivering lectures on insurance mathematics. He had also taken the state exams as a teacher and was a student councillor. In 1920 he became an extraordinary professor of insurance mathematics at the University of Munich, which he taught up to his retirement in 1955. He also taught other applications of mathematics in business.[2]\n He remained for a long time the only actuarial science mathematician at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and was only temporarily supported by the former director of Hamburger Feuerkasse, Paul Riebesell, who was appointed honorary professor in 1938 at the university. The successor of B\u00f6hm in Munich was Hans Richter, who in 1955 received an ordinariat (German: Lehrstuhl) for mathematical statistics and economic mathematics.\n B\u00f6hm's two-volume textbook on insurance (actuarial science) mathematics was widely disseminated .\n ", "tags": ["1885 births", "1965 deaths", "German cryptographers", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Actuaries", "History of insurance", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Use dmy dates from February 2017", "Use British English from February 2017", "Articles containing German-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\nFriedrich B\u00f6hm (* 15 August 1885 in Harburg (Swabia) near Donauw\u00f6rth, died 25 August 1965 in Munich) was a German actuarial and insurance mathematician and university lecturer.[1] During World War II, B\u00f6hm was conscripted into Group IV of Inspectorate 7 (German: Horchleistelle), an early cipher bureau and Signals intelligence agency of the German Army (Wehrmacht) (German: Heer), working to decode foreign Ciphers.
