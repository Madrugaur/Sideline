The travelling salesman problem can involve either fixed or random points distributed over a certain region.\u00a0The Theorem established that the shortest length between random points is asymptotically equal to a non-random function of\u00a0n.\u00a0For large\u00a0n\u00a0the distinction between the random and the non-random versions of the problem effectively vanishes.
