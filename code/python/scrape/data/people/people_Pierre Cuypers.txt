{"name": "Pierre Cuypers", "content": "Petrus Josephus Hubertus \"Pierre\" Cuypers (16 May 1827 \u2013 3 March 1921) was a Dutch architect. His name is most frequently associated with the Amsterdam Central Station (1881\u20131889) and the Rijksmuseum (1876\u20131885), both in Amsterdam. More representative for his oeuvre, however, are numerous churches, of which he designed more than 100.[citation needed] Moreover, he restored many monuments.\n Cuypers was born in Roermond, the son of a church painter, and grew up in surroundings in which interest for art was encouraged. After he studied at the urban college in Roermond, he moved to Antwerp in 1844 to study architecture at the Royal art academy. He was taught by Frans Andries Durlet, Frans Stoop and Ferdinand Berckmans, all pioneers of the neo-Gothic architecture in Belgium. Cuypers was a good student; in 1849, he gained the Prix d'Excellence of the academy.\n After a tour in the German Rheinland, he returned to Roermond, where he was appointed a town architect in 1851. In 1852, he opened a workshop where ecclesiastical art was manufactured.\n Cuypers' ecclesiastical work was initially strongly influenced by 13th century French architecture and by the writings of his friends Eugene Viollet-le-Duc and J.

Highlights from these first period are the Lambert's Church in Veghel and the Catharina Church (Eindhoven)\u00a0[nl] in Eindhoven, among others. From 1870 onwards Cuypers' style became more influenced by the native Gothic styles of the Netherlands as well as Gothic styles from other countries like Norway and Italy. He also experimented with centralizing ground-plans and other non-conventional layouts. In this second part of his career he built some of his best work. After 1883 he was assisted by his son Joseph Cuypers in much of his work.\n Cuypers led many restorations. His conceptions concerning restorations has been frequently criticized; restoration often implied that the building was awfully damaged, but Cuypers tried to satisfy an idealized image of the style or the idea how the original builders had intended a building to be rather than to preserve the architectural evolution of the building. An early example of this is the extensive restoration of the Munster Church in Roermond, where Cuypers replaced original towers with new ones. From 1875 he led the restoration of the eastern front of the Mainz Cathedral, which he executed according to his own plans in Romanesque style.

The result is similar to the H\u00f4tel de Ville in Paris in what is considered to be  \"French Neo-Renaissance\" style.  However, at the  Rijksmuseum the Gothic elements seem to outweigh the Renaissance and the building, despite the English Renaissance quoins, and chateauesque roofs, is sometimes considered to be Neo-Gothic.[2]\nPetrus Josephus Hubertus \"Pierre\" Cuypers (16 May 1827 \u2013 3 March 1921) was a Dutch architect.
