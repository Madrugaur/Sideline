{"name": "Bruno von Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff", "content": "\n Bruno Baron von Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff (born June 11, 1912 in Bilderlingshof near Riga \u2013 died February 28, 1996 in T\u00fcbingen) was a German philosopher, mathematician and epistemologist.[1] He was also a university lecturer at the University of T\u00fcbingen. During World War II, Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff worked as a mathematician in the In 7/VI, that was the signals intelligence agency of the Wehrmacht and worked with  Fritz Menzer on the testing of cryptographic devices and procedures. Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff worked specifically on the testing of the m-40 cipher machine. His most important contributions to the history of logic and mathematics was his studies and descriptions from 1957, of the calculating machine, built by Wilhelm Schickard.[2]\n Bruno von Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff was an aristocrat and a member of the noble house of Frydag. \n After attending lectures in mathematics, physics, musicology and philosophy at the Universities of Greifswald and Munich, Freytag earned his doctorate in Philosophy in Greifswald in 1936 and habilitated in 1944 in Freiburg im Breisgau and 1947 in T\u00fcbingen after taking part in the war. From 1955, Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff was Professor of Philosophy at the University of T\u00fcbingen. In 1957 he reconstructed the first calculating machine of 1623, which was handed down only in scanty sketches, of the T\u00fcbingen astronomy professor Wilhelm Schickard. He also built the data sticks from Schickard. After his retirement in 1977 Freytag studied the structures of the still new PCs.\n During the Third German Congress of Philosophy in October 1950, Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff presented a series of theses to the Symposium, where he argued that the various logical systems were not pure but that each of them includes a pure kernel that could be identified, and separated out. The kernel could be considered pure philosophical logic, i.e. logic tout court which is characterized by its properties, that is identity, contradiction and their interweaving (German: Verflechtung). Although there were many logical calculi, he considered pure logic to be unique and that diverse logical systems are mathematical systems that must be interpreted with the aid of pure logic. For Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff:\n Logical calculi begin from elements which require analysis through pure logic. He considered the most fundamental element in logistic is judgment (German: Urteil), the most fundamental element in logic is concept, (German: Begriff). Pure philosophical logic is a closed, self-contained, system, without fundamental flaws and of great beauty and wide applicability, and attacks against classical logic are largely unjustified. Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff was a staunch proponent of Aristotelian logic.[2] His views were challenged by J\u00f3zef Maria Boche\u0144ski, Paul Bernays and B\u00e9la Juhos, who were also at the Symposium. Haskell Curry constructed a logical model that he used to contest Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff theses.[2]\n His most important contribution to logic was the study, that started in 1979, of the calculating machine of Wilhelm Schickard. During his lifetime, he constructed several models, one of which he kept at his home.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1912 births", "1996 deaths", "University of T\u00fcbingen faculty", "German philosophers", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Epistemologists", "20th-century philosophers", "Use dmy dates from November 2017", "Use British English from November 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing German-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nBruno Baron von Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoffImage of Bruno von Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff in contemplation.BornJune 11, 1912\u00a0(1912-06-11)Bilderlingshof, RigaDiedFebruary 28, 1996(1996-02-28) (aged\u00a083)T\u00fcbingen, GermanyCitizenshipGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of GreifswaldLudwig Maximilian University of MunichUniversity of T\u00fcbingenScientific careerFieldsphilosophyMathematicsEpistemologyInstitutionsUniversity of T\u00fcbingen\n\nBruno Baron von Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff (born June 11, 1912 in Bilderlingshof near Riga \u2013 died February 28, 1996 in T\u00fcbingen) was a German philosopher, mathematician and epistemologist.[1] He was also a university lecturer at the University of T\u00fcbingen.
