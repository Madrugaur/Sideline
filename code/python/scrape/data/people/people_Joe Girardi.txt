{"name": "Joe Girardi", "content": "\n Joseph Elliott Girardi (born October 14, 1964) is an American retired professional baseball player and current manager for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). \n Girardi played the catcher position for the Chicago Cubs, Colorado Rockies, New York Yankees, and St. Louis Cardinals during a big league playing career that spanned from 1989 to 2003. He won three World Series championships with the Yankees in the 1990s and served as the catcher for both Dwight Gooden's no-hitter and David Cone's perfect game.\n Girardi became the Yankees\u2019 bench coach in 2005. In 2006, he managed the Florida Marlins and was named the National League (NL) Manager of the Year. Girardi managed the Yankees from 2008 to 2017, winning the 2009 World Series over the Phillies. He has served as an analyst for MLB Network and Fox Sports, and he was named manager of the Phillies in October 2019.\n Girardi, the fourth son of Jerry, a former blue collar worker and United States Air Force veteran,[1] and Angela Girardi, was born in Peoria, Illinois, and grew up in East Peoria, Illinois and attended high school at the Spalding Institure.[2][3]\n Girardi enrolled at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he attended from 1983 through 1986. He played for the Northwestern Wildcats baseball team, where he was a two-time All Big Ten selection and a three-time Academic All-American.[4] In 1984, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League.[5] In 1986, he earned a bachelor of science degree in industrial engineering and was awarded the Big Ten Medal of Honor, which recognizes one male and one female student from the graduating class of each Big Ten member school for demonstrating joint athletic and academic excellence throughout their college career.[6][7] He was the first freshman to be elected president of a fraternity (Alpha Tau Omega) at Northwestern.[8]\n The Chicago Cubs drafted Girardi in the fifth round of the 1986 MLB draft. He spent four seasons in the Cubs minor leagues system before making his major league debut. In 1986, Girardi batted .309 in 68 games with the Peoria Chiefs of the Midwest League. In 1989, he also played for the \u00c1guilas del Zulia in the Venezuelan Winter League.[9]\n Girardi made his Major League debut for the Cubs on April 4, 1989. During his rookie year with the Cubs, Girardi batted .248 with a home run and 14 runs batted in (RBIs) in 59 games played. In 1990, he played in 133 games, batting .270 with a home run and 38 RBIs. In 1991, he played in only 21 games, batting .191 with 6 RBIs. In 1992, he played in 91 games, batting .270 with a home run and 12 RBIs.[citation needed]\n The Cubs left Girardi unprotected in the 1992 MLB expansion draft and the Colorado Rockies chose him. During his first year with the Rockies in 1993, he played in 86 games batting .290 with five triples, three home runs, and 31 RBIs. In 1994, he played in 93 games batting .276 with four triples, four home runs, and 34 RBIs. In 1995, he played in 125 games batting .262 with a career-high 8 home runs and 55 RBIs.[citation needed]\n After the 1995 season, the New York Yankees acquired Girardi from the Rockies in exchange for pitcher Mike DeJean. Girardi took the place of Mike Stanley.[10]\n On May 14, 1996, Girardi caught Dwight Gooden's no-hitter. Girardi played in 124 games during the 1996 season, batting .294 with two home runs and 45 RBIs. In Game 6 of the 1996 World Series against the Atlanta Braves, Girardi hit an RBI triple against Greg Maddux that helped the Yankees win that game and ultimately the World Series.[11] When the Yankees made 25-year-old prospect Jorge Posada the backup catcher, Girardi became his mentor.[12] The two catchers split time for the Yankees through 1999.[13] In 1997, Girardi played in 112 games batting .264 with one home run and 50 RBIs. During the World Series-winning 1998 season, he played in 78 games batting .276 with three home runs and 31 RBIs. On July 18, 1999, Girardi caught David Cone's perfect game.[14] During the World Series-winning 1999 season, Girardi played in 65 games batting .239 with two home runs and 27 RBIs.[citation needed]\n In 2000, Girardi left the Yankees and returned to the Cubs, where he was named to that year's All-Star team, as an injury replacement for Mike Piazza.[15] During the 2000 season, Girardi played in 106 games batting .278 with six home runs and 40 RBIs. In 2001, he played in 78 games batting .253 with three home runs and 25 RBIs.[16]\n On June 22, 2002, Girardi was asked to speak to the hometown crowd after the Cubs' nationally televised matchup with the St. Louis Cardinals was cancelled by Commissioner Bud Selig, after Cardinals pitcher Darryl Kile was found dead earlier that day. Taking to the field microphone behind home plate, an emotional Girardi fought back tears as he said that \"due to a tragedy in the Cardinal family\" there would be no game that day. He never specified what had happened, instead asking fans to be respectful of the matter as they found out about it on their own and to pray.[17][18] Overall, during 2002, Girardi batted .226 with a home run and 26 RBIs in 90 games played.[citation needed]\n In 2003, Girardi played for the Cardinals. He appeared in just 16 games, accumulating 23 at bats in which he batted .130 with one RBI and a .361 on-base plus slugging percentage. Girardi retired at the end of the season.[citation needed]\n After a spring training stint with the Yankees in 2004, Girardi retired and became a commentator for the YES Network. He hosted the youth-oriented Yankees on Deck, received good reviews and was offered a larger role on 2005 Yankee broadcasts. But he rejected that offer, as well as an offer by Florida Marlins to become the bench coach with a guarantee to become the team's manager in 2006, although he subsequently got that job. Instead, he became the Yankees' bench coach. He managed a game during a Joe Torre suspension, a loss to the Kansas City Royals. Girardi remained the host of Kids on Deck in 2005, having shot his shows before spring training. During games, YES promoted Kids on Deck by showing Girardi sitting in the dugout during breaks in the game.[19]\n Girardi was a broadcaster for the third, fourth, and fifth games of the 2006 World Series for Fox as part of the network's pregame and postgame team, along with host Jeanne Zelasko and regular analyst Kevin Kennedy.[citation needed]\n After fielding managerial offers for the 2007 season, Girardi instead came to terms with the YES network to return to the broadcast booth for 60-plus games as a Yankees analyst and co-host a new show on the network, Behind The Plate, with John Flaherty, also a former Yankee catcher.[20] Girardi also served as color commentator for the No.2 booth (usually with Thom Brennaman) on Major League Baseball on Fox.[citation needed]\n In 2018, he joined MLB Network as an analyst.[citation needed]\n After the 2005 regular season, Girardi was named the manager of the Marlins, replacing manager Jack McKeon. His first notable action as manager was to prohibit facial hair, a policy similar to that of Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.[21]\n The team had a 78\u201384 record with Girardi as manager,[22] and was in wild-card contention even though the team had the lowest payroll in Major League Baseball.[23] At $15\u00a0million, the Marlins' 2006 payroll was lower than the salaries of several MLB players. However, Girardi was nearly fired on August 6[24] when he got into an argument with Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria during a game. According to witnesses and video footage, the Marlins owner was heckling home plate umpire Larry Vanover. When the umpire warned Girardi about the harassment, Girardi and his bench coach Gary Tuck then turned to Loria and told him to stop. Team executives had to talk Loria out of his stated desire to fire Girardi immediately after that game.[25]\n On October 3, 2006 the Marlins announced that they had fired Girardi, despite him winning 2006 Manager of the Year. Girardi said only that he appreciated the opportunity to manage the club. Girardi was thought to be among the leading candidates to replace New York Yankees manager Joe Torre after they lost in the 2006 American League Division Series, but Torre remained with the team. Girardi was also a candidate for the Cubs' manager position, to succeed Dusty Baker; he interviewed for the job just days after leaving the Marlins. With his playing experience in Chicago, he was considered a front-runner for the position.[26] However, the Cubs chose to go with veteran manager Lou Piniella. Girardi took himself out of the running for the Washington Nationals' managerial job shortly thereafter and returned to the broadcast booth for the YES Network in 2007. He said taking another managerial job would have meant a third move in as many years for his family.[27] Despite Girardi's firing, he was rewarded for his achievements with the Marlins in 2006 with the National League Manager of the Year Award[28] and the Sporting News Manager of the Year Award for the National League.[29]\n In June 2007 after the Baltimore Orioles fired manager Sam Perlozzo, Girardi interviewed for and was offered the position with the Orioles but turned it down.[30]\n When the Yankees' managerial position became vacant after the 2007 season, the Yankees interviewed Girardi, Tony Pe\u00f1a, and Don Mattingly. On October 29, 2007, Girardi was reported to be the Yankees' choice[31] and the next day he signed a three-year contract, reportedly worth about $7.5\u00a0million.[32] Girardi chose to wear number 27 to signify his wish to lead the Yankees to their 27th world championship.[33] Girardi is a health enthusiast and banned sweets such as ice cream and soda in the clubhouse.[34]\n On August 2, 2008, Girardi participated in his first Old Timers' Day, the last such game played at the original Yankee Stadium. Girardi participated in the next Old Timer's Day on July 19, 2009, the first in the new Yankee Stadium, as well as every one since then. Girardi's first year as a Yankees manager was unsuccessful as the team was eliminated from postseason contention for the first time since 1993, finishing 2008 with an 89\u201373 record, 3rd in the AL East.[citation needed]\n In 2009, his second year as manager, the Yankees were a much improved team. He led the Yankees to their 40th AL pennant and their 27th World Series title (defeating the Philadelphia Phillies), his first World Series title as manager and the Yankees' first since 2000.[35]\n Before the 2010 season, Girardi changed his number to 28. Newly acquired center-fielder Curtis Granderson had worn 28, but agreed to change his number to 14.[36]\n Following the 2010 season, Girardi and the Yankees agreed to a three-year deal to keep him as the Yankees' manager.[37]\n The Yankees' 2011 season was plagued by injuries that caused disabled list stints for several key players. Despite the setbacks, Girardi managed to lead the team to the AL East title. Rob Parker of ESPN commended Girardi's performance and felt his efforts were deserving of American League Manager of the Year, but felt he would not get the award due to the Yankees high payroll and what Parker alleges is an anti-Yankee bias.[38] The Yankees were defeated by the Detroit Tigers 3\u20132 in the divisional round.[39]\n On June 15, 2012, Girardi won his 500th game as a manager.[40] The Yankees reached the playoffs and defeated the Baltimore Orioles 3\u20132 in the ALDS, but were swept by the Detroit Tigers in the ALCS on October 18, 2012. Girardi's 2013 season was marred by numerous player injuries and controversies, resulting in the Yankees finishing 85-77 (tied 3rd in AL East) and missing the postseason for the first time since 2008.[citation needed]\n On October 10, 2013 Girardi signed a four-year deal worth $16 million to remain as manager of the New York Yankees.[41]\n In 2014 the Yankees finished 84\u201378, (2nd place in AL East) and did not qualify for the postseason for the second straight year. In 2015, the Yankees finished 87\u201375, (2nd place again in AL East), clinching the top wild card spot which marked the team's first playoff appearance since 2012, but they lost to the Houston Astros in the 2015 American League Wild Card Game. On May 21, 2016, Girardi managed his 1,500th game.[42]\n After missing the playoffs again in 2016, the Yankees finished 91\u201371 in 2017, second place in the AL East, and qualified for the postseason as the first Wild Card team in the AL. In 2017 he was successful on a higher percentage of replay challenges than any other MLB manager with 10 or more challenges, at 75.0%.[43] The Yankees beat the Twins, 8\u20134, in the wild card game and advanced to the ALDS, where they played the Cleveland Indians. After falling behind 0\u20132, amidst a controversial decision to not challenge a potential hit-by-pitch, Girardi's Yankees rallied back to win three games in a row and faced the Houston Astros in the ALCS. The series began in Houston, and after again falling behind 0\u20132, the team won all three games at Yankee Stadium, but the season ended after losing Games 6 and 7 back in Houston. Afterward, Girardi's contract expired and on October 26, the Yankees announced he would not return as manager, being replaced by Aaron Boone.[44][45][46]\n On August 7, 2019, he became the United States national baseball team manager at the 2019 WBSC Premier12.\n[47] But, on October 16, 2019, he canceled so that he could seek managerial opportunities in Major League Baseball.[48]\n On October 24, 2019, the Philadelphia Phillies hired Girardi as their manager, replacing Gabe Kapler.[49]\n Girardi and his wife Kim Innocenzi-Girardi live in Purchase, New York, and have three children.[50] Girardi is of Italian descent and is a devout Christian.[51]\n While driving home after winning the 2009 World Series, Girardi stopped to help a car crash victim on a dangerous blind curve of the Cross County Parkway in Eastchester, New York. Police said Girardi put his own life at risk while trying to help the driver who had just crashed into a wall. The driver said she had no idea who Girardi was until the responding officers identified him. The next day, Girardi said, \"I think the most important thing is that, obviously, there's a lot of joy in what we do, but we can't forget to be human beings when we help others out.\"[52][53]\n On October 6, 2012, during the 2012 ALDS against the Baltimore Orioles, Girardi's father Jerry Girardi died at the age of 81. He had Alzheimer's disease and spent the past several years in an assisted care facility.[54] His mother had died from cancer while Joe was a student-athlete at Northwestern University.[55]\n ", "tags": ["1964 births", "Living people", "American sportspeople of Italian descent", "Baseball coaches from Illinois", "Baseball players from Illinois", "Christians from Illinois", "Chicago Cubs players", "Colorado Rockies players", "Colorado Springs Sky Sox players", "Cotuit Kettleers players", "Florida Marlins managers", "Iowa Cubs players", "Major League Baseball broadcasters", "Major League Baseball bench coaches", "Major League Baseball catchers", "Manager of the Year Award winners", "Memphis Redbirds players", "National League All-Stars", "New York Yankees announcers", "New York Yankees coaches", "New York Yankees managers", "New York Yankees players", "Northwestern Wildcats baseball players", "People from East Peoria, Illinois", "Peoria Chiefs players", "Philadelphia Phillies managers", "Pittsfield Cubs players", "Sportspeople from Peoria, Illinois", "St. Louis Cardinals players", "Tennessee Smokies players", "YES Network", "Winston-Salem Spirits players", "World Series-winning managers", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from May 2017", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from December 2020", "Articles with unsourced statements from October 2017", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American baseball player and manager\nFor the American football coach, see Joe Girardi (American football).\n\n\nJoe GirardiGirardi in 2020Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 No. 25Catcher / ManagerBorn:  (1964-10-14) October 14, 1964 (age\u00a056)Peoria, Illinois\nBatted: Right\nThrew: Right\nMLB debutApril 4,\u00a01989,\u00a0for the\u00a0Chicago CubsLast MLB appearanceSeptember 28,\u00a02003,\u00a0for the\u00a0St. Louis CardinalsMLB statisticsBatting average.267Home runs36Runs batted in422Managerial record1,016 \u2013 826Winning\u00a0%.552\nTeams\nAs player\nChicago Cubs (1989\u20131992)\nColorado Rockies (1993\u20131995)\nNew York Yankees (1996\u20131999)\nChicago Cubs (2000\u20132002)\nSt. Louis Cardinals (2003)\nAs manager\nFlorida Marlins (2006)\nNew York Yankees (2008\u20132017)\nPhiladelphia Phillies (2020\u2013present)\nAs coach\nNew York Yankees (2005)\nCareer highlights and awards\nAll-Star (2000)\n4\u00d7 World Series champion (1996, 1998, 1999, 2009)\nNL Manager of the Year (2006)\n\nJoseph Elliott Girardi (born October 14, 1964) is an American retired professional baseball player and current manager for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). \nGirardi played the catcher position for the Chicago Cubs, Colorado Rockies, New York Yankees, and St. Louis Cardinals during a big league playing career that spanned from 1989 to 2003.

Newly acquired center-fielder Curtis Granderson had worn 28, but agreed to change his number to 14.[36]\n\n Girardi as manager of the Yankees\nFollowing the 2010 season, Girardi and the Yankees agreed to a three-year deal to keep him as the Yankees' manager.[37]\nThe Yankees' 2011 season was plagued by injuries that caused disabled list stints for several key players. Despite the setbacks, Girardi managed to lead the team to the AL East title. Rob Parker of ESPN commended Girardi's performance and felt his efforts were deserving of American League Manager of the Year, but felt he would not get the award due to the Yankees high payroll and what Parker alleges is an anti-Yankee bias.[38] The Yankees were defeated by the Detroit Tigers 3\u20132 in the divisional round.[39]\n\n Girardi managing the Yankees in 2011\nOn June 15, 2012, Girardi won his 500th game as a manager.[40] The Yankees reached the playoffs and defeated the Baltimore Orioles 3\u20132 in the ALDS, but were swept by the Detroit Tigers in the ALCS on October 18, 2012. Girardi's 2013 season was marred by numerous player injuries and controversies, resulting in the Yankees finishing 85-77 (tied 3rd in AL East) and missing the postseason for the first time since 2008.[citation needed]\nOn October 10, 2013 Girardi signed a four-year deal worth $16 million to remain as manager of the New York Yankees.[41]\nIn 2014 the Yankees finished 84\u201378, (2nd place in AL East) and did not qualify for the postseason for the second straight year. In 2015, the Yankees finished 87\u201375, (2nd place again in AL East), clinching the top wild card spot which marked the team's first playoff appearance since 2012, but they lost to the Houston Astros in the 2015 American League Wild Card Game. On May 21, 2016, Girardi managed his 1,500th game.[42]\n\n Joe Girardi presents President Barack Obama with a New York Yankees signed team jersey during the Yankees trip to the White House.\nAfter missing the playoffs again in 2016, the Yankees finished 91\u201371 in 2017, second place in the AL East, and qualified for the postseason as the first Wild Card team in the AL. In 2017 he was successful on a higher percentage of replay challenges than any other MLB manager with 10 or more challenges, at 75.0%.[43] The Yankees beat the Twins, 8\u20134, in the wild card game and advanced to the ALDS, where they played the Cleveland Indians. After falling behind 0\u20132, amidst a controversial decision to not challenge a potential hit-by-pitch, Girardi's Yankees rallied back to win three games in a row and faced the Houston Astros in the ALCS. The series began in Houston, and after again falling behind 0\u20132, the team won all three games at Yankee Stadium, but the season ended after losing Games 6 and 7 back in Houston. Afterward, Girardi's contract expired and on October 26, the Yankees announced he would not return as manager, being replaced by Aaron Boone.[44][45][46]\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies (2019\u2013present)[edit]\nOn August 7, 2019, he became the United States national baseball team manager at the 2019 WBSC Premier12.\n[47] But, on October 16, 2019, he canceled so that he could seek managerial opportunities in Major League Baseball.[48]\nOn October 24, 2019, the Philadelphia Phillies hired Girardi as their manager, replacing Gabe Kapler.[49]\n\nManagerial record[edit]\nAs of games played on September 27, 2020\n\n\nTeam\nYear\nRegular season\nPostseason\n\n\nGames\nWon\nLost\nWin\u00a0%\nFinish\nWon\nLost\nWin\u00a0%\nResult\n\n\nFLA\n2006\n\n162\n78\n84\n.481\n4th in NL East\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\n\nFLA total\n162\n78\n84\n.481\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\n\nNYY\n2008\n\n162\n89\n73\n.549\n3rd in AL East\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\n\nNYY\n2009\n\n162\n103\n59\n.636\n1st in AL East\n11\n4\n.733\nWon World Series\n\n\nNYY\n2010\n\n162\n95\n67\n.586\n2nd in AL East\n5\n4\n.556\nLost ALCS\n\n\nNYY\n2011\n\n162\n97\n65\n.599\n1st in AL East\n2\n3\n.400\nLost ALDS\n\n\nNYY\n2012\n\n162\n95\n67\n.586\n1st in AL East\n3\n6\n.333\nLost ALCS\n\n\nNYY\n2013\n\n162\n85\n77\n.525\n3rd in AL East\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\n\nNYY\n2014\n\n162\n84\n78\n.519\n2nd in AL East\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\n\nNYY\n2015\n\n162\n87\n75\n.537\n2nd in AL East\n0\n1\n.000\nLost ALWC\n\n\nNYY\n2016\n\n162\n84\n78\n.519\n4th in AL East\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\n\nNYY\n2017\n\n162\n91\n71\n.562\n2nd in AL East\n7\n6\n.538\nLost ALCS\n\n\nNYY total\n1620\n910\n710\n.562\n\n28\n24\n.538\n\n\n\nPHI\n2020\n\n60\n28\n32\n.467\n3rd in NL East\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\n\nPHI total\n60\n28\n32\n.467\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\n\nTotal [22]\n1842\n1016\n826\n.552\n\n28\n24\n.538\n\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nGirardi and his wife Kim Innocenzi-Girardi live in Purchase, New York, and have three children.[50] Girardi is of Italian descent and is a devout Christian.[51]\nWhile driving home after winning the 2009 World Series, Girardi stopped to help a car crash victim on a dangerous blind curve of the Cross County Parkway in Eastchester, New York. Police said Girardi put his own life at risk while trying to help the driver who had just crashed into a wall. The driver said she had no idea who Girardi was until the responding officers identified him. The next day, Girardi said, \"I think the most important thing is that, obviously, there's a lot of joy in what we do, but we can't forget to be human beings when we help others out.\"[52][53]\nOn October 6, 2012, during the 2012 ALDS against the Baltimore Orioles, Girardi's father Jerry Girardi died at the age of 81. He had Alzheimer's disease and spent the past several years in an assisted care facility.[54] His mother had died from cancer while Joe was a student-athlete at Northwestern University.[55]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"2012 ALCS - Joe Girardi, New York Yankees manager, attends father's funeral\".
