According to Moritz Steinschneider (\"Hebr. Uebers.\" p.\u00a0777), the original Latin has been printed under the title \"Gentilis de Fulgineo\".\nThe \"Medicationis Parabol\u00e6\" of Arnau de Vilanova (1378).\nUnder the title, \"Sefer Mebo ha Ne'arim\" (Introduction for the Young), the elementary treatise on fevers, by Gerard de Solo (1379).\n\"Megillah,\" the treatise of Arnau de Vilanova on \"Digestive and Purgative Medicines\" (1381).\n\"Almanzuri,\" the abridged commentary of Gerard de Solo on the ninth book of Razi's \"Ad Almansorem.\" The translation is greatly abbreviated, but remarks of his own, derived from personal experience, are added.\n\"Tratato\" or \"Higgayon,\" from the \"Tractatus Summularum,\" a treatise on logic, by Pierre d'Espagne.\nExplanations of the middle commentary of Averroes (Ibn Roshd) on the first three parts of the \"Organon\": the \"Isagoge\", the \"Categories\", and \"De Interpretatione\". This is derived not only from Arabic but also from Latin sources.\nIn 1399 Abigdor assisted his son Solomon Abigdor, then only 15 years of age, in the translation of the Latin treatise, \"De Judiciis Astronomi\u00e6,\" or \"Capitula Astrologi\u00e6,\" of Arnau de Vilanova into Hebrew, under the title \"Panim ba-Mishpa\u1e6d\".\n\nReferences[edit]\nLes \u00c9crivains Juifs Fran\u00e7ais, pp.\u00a0717\u2013721;\nHenri Gross, Gallia Judaica, pp.\u00a0333, 334.\nExternal links[edit]\nSource\n\u00a0This article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Singer, Isidore;  et\u00a0al., eds.
