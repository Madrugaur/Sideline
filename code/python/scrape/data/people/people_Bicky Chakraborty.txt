{"name": "Bicky Chakraborty", "content": "\n Barun Bicky Chakraborty (born 28 August 1943) is an Indian-born Swedish businessman. He is the president and founder of Elite Hotels of Sweden & The Bishop's Arms.[1] He is counted as one of the richest men in Scandinavia.[2]\n Chakraborty came to Sweden from Kolkata, India in 1966 to study Sociology at the University of Stockholm.[citation needed] He saw that student dormitories were empty over the summer and began pushing the dorm Domus as a discount hotel to rent out those who were located near Stureplan in Stockholm. Chakraborty managed to acquire these properties from the student association in private hands and they became due plate in his hotel empire. Later he went on to buy the rundown city hotel and rehabilitate it. In 1980, he bought Hotel in London, a historic city hotel from 1858. At this time there were several run down city hotels around the country. Swedish hospitality was most focused on motels near urban areas. Chakraborty saw this opportunity to revive the ancient city hotel tradition, but in a more modern form. Bicky Chakraborty now owns and operates the hotel chain Elite, which covers several historically important city hotels in the country, including Hotel Knaust in Sundsvall, Hotel Mollberg in Helsingborg, Hotel Savoy in Malm\u00f6 and the City Hotel in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s.
