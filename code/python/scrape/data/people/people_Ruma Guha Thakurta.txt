{"name": "Ruma Guha Thakurta", "content": "\n Ruma Guha Thakurta (born 3 November 1934 \u2013 3 June 2019) was an Indian actress and singer primarily associated with Bengali language films.[1][2] She founded Calcutta Youth Choir in 1958.\n Guha Thakurta  was born on 3 November 1934[3] to Satyen Ghosh (Monty Ghosh) and singer Sati Devi. Guha Thakurta 's family was culturally inclined to Brahmo Samaj, a societal component of Brahmoism. Sati was a trained vocalist and elder sister to Bijoya Ray, wife of Satyajit Ray. Guha Thakurta began as a dancer. Later, she went to Almora Academy of Uday Shankar at Lahore to study dance. She started training in music at Swarabitan in Kolkata, which had been established by her parents. In later years, she studied under Abdul Rehman Khan of Patiala gharana, the Ustad of Nirmla Devi and Lakshmi Shankar in Bombay.\n She married Kishore Kumar in 1951 and had a son Amit Kumar by this marriage. The couple divorced in 1958 and she married Arup Guha Thakurta in 1960.[4] The couple had two children, Ayan and Sromona. Sromona is also a singer.\n Guha Thakurta  made her acting debut in Amiya Chakravarty's Jwar Bhata (1944)[5] at age ten. This was the debut film of Dilip Kumar. Her next film as Ruma Ghosh was Nitin Bose's Mashaal (1950) in Hindi, which had a Bengali version called Samar, adapted from Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel Rajani.[6] She portrayed a blind girl, Sarla.\n After her divorce, Ruma moved to Calcutta to act in Rajen Tarafdar\u2019s Ganga based on Samaresh Bose\u2019s eponymous cult novel. She acted as one of two leading ladies, with Sandhya Roy.[7] Ganga won the National award for Best Feature Film that year and Ruma's portrayal of Himi received critical acclamation. In the same year, she acted in Personal Assistant opposite to Bhanu Bandopadhayay and in Khaniker Atithi by Tapan Sinha.\n Her film career revived in 1962 with Benarasi, produced by her and directed by her husband. It was the tale of a courtesan who tries to lead a life of dignity and respect, when her childhood sweetheart, Ratan, takes her away from her terrible environment. It flopped, but won the BFJA Award for Best Feature Film the following year.\n ", "tags": ["2019 deaths", "Bengali actresses", "Actresses in Bengali cinema", "Bengali singers", "Brahmos", "People associated with Santiniketan", "Indian film actresses", "Actresses from Kolkata", "20th-century Indian actresses", "20th-century Indian singers", "21st-century Indian women singers", "Women musicians from West Bengal", "Actresses in Hindi cinema", "Indian female film singers", "Bengali playback singers", "Singers from Kolkata", "20th-century Indian women singers", "21st-century Indian singers", "21st-century Indian actresses", "1934 births", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with possible conflicts of interest from July 2019", "Use Indian English from October 2017", "All Wikipedia articles written in Indian English", "Use dmy dates from January 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using Template:Infobox musical artist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Indian actress\n A major contributor to this article appears to have a close connection with its subject.
