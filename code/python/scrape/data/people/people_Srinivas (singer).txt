He was offered the opportunity to work with Ilaiyaraaja, but things did not work out, as he was suffering from severe throat infection that day.\n In 1992, the soundtrack of Mani Ratnam's Tamil film Roja reignited his dreams of playback singing. Mani Ratnam introduced composer A. R. Rahman with this movie, who then went on to change the music scene in the whole Indian film industry.

Rahman took a liking to his rendition of Mehdi Hassan's ghazals and offered him work at Chennai.\n In 1994, Srinivas shifted base to madras and started lending his voice to advertisement jingles and devotional albums.\n His first foray into playback singing began with the song \"Sorgam Enbathu Namakku\" with Swarnalatha from the movie Nammavar, acted by Kamal Haasan.

His other hits in Hindi include \"Kaisi Hai Yeh\" from Dil Chahta Hai and \"Zindagi\" from the film Yuvvraaj.\n Srinivas is a close associate to A. R. Rahman from the very first day they got introduced. On working with Rahman, he says,\n \"There can be only one Rahman. Two years ago, he called me out of the blue to supervise his recordings. I consider it an honour. Earlier, he would be there to monitor every single take. I sometimes wonder if I can match his perfection standards,\" and adds, \"He's at lightning speed when it comes to creativity and innovations. There are times when he compliments me and nothing feels as good as that. For me, it's like an award.\"[2] He was a judge on Airtel Super Singer, aired in Vijay TV along with Sujatha and P.
