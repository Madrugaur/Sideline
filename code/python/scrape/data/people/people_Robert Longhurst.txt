{"name": "Robert Longhurst", "content": "Robert Longhurst is an American sculptor who was born in Schenectady, New York in 1949. At an early age he was fascinated by his father\u2019s small figurative woodcarvings.[1]\n Longhurst received a Bachelor of Architecture from Kent State University in 1975.  He began his artistic career in 1976 in Cincinnati, Ohio.  His first commissioned works were three figurative sculptures in black walnut for Cincinnati businessman Joe David who owned Midwest Woodworking company.[2]  In 1978 Longhurst completed a life size figure in pine of an Adirondack hermit, Noah John Rondeau for the Adirondack Museum in Blue Mountain Lake, New York.[3]\n Although Longhurst's career began with figurative works, it soon evolved into non-representational abstraction in exotic woods, marble and granite that draws on his background in Architecture.  Many of his pieces are defined as being at the intersection of where the fields of art and math overlap, and they have been discussed by Mathematicians such as Nathaniel Friedman, Reuben Hersh, and Ivars Peterson.[4][5][6][7]  Some of his sculptures portray minimal surfaces, which were named after German geometer Alfred Enneper.[6]  Nathaniel Friedman writes, \"The surfaces [of Longhurst's sculptures] generally have appealing sections with negative curvature (saddle surfaces).

Two of his sculptures representing minimal surfaces were enlarged and carved from blocks of snow measuring 12' high x 10' wide x 10' deep.[8][9]  In the 2000 championships, the team received second place, Artists' Choice Award, and People's Choice Award.[7]\n Robert Longhurst lives in Chestertown, New York.\n ", "tags": ["1949 births", "Living people", "Mathematical artists", "20th-century American sculptors", "20th-century male artists", "21st-century American sculptors", "21st-century male artists", "American male sculptors", "American woodcarvers", "Kent State University alumni", "People from Schenectady, New York"], "raw": " Arabesque XXXI carved in bubinga wood by Robert Longhurst, c.\u00a02007, University of Michigan\nRobert Longhurst is an American sculptor who was born in Schenectady, New York in 1949.
