Its existence was outside Soviet authority and it was investigated by the KGB. Subbotovskaya herself was interrogated a number of times by the KGB and shortly thereafter was hit by a truck and died, in what has been speculated was an assassination.[4]\n Prior to founding the Jewish People's University, Subbotovskaya published papers in mathematical logic.
