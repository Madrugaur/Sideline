{"name": "Victor Vacquier", "content": "Victor Vacquier, Sr. (October 13, 1907 \u2013 January 11, 2009) was a professor of geophysics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.[1][2]\n Vacquier was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. In 1920, Vacquier escaped the Russian Civil War with his family, taking a horse-drawn sleigh across the ice of the Gulf of Finland to Helsinki, then moving to France and (in 1923) to the United States.[1][2] He received a B.S. in electrical engineering in 1927 from the University of Wisconsin, and a master's degree in physics in 1929, but never earned a Ph.D.[1][2] He worked for Gulf Research Laboratories, the research arm of Gulf Oil, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and then during World War II he moved to the Airborne Instruments Laboratory at Columbia University, where he applied the fluxgate magnetometer, an instrument he had invented at Gulf, to submarine detection.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] Following the war, he worked at Sperry Gyroscope Inc. developing gyrocompasses; then in 1953 he moved to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, where he worked on groundwater detection.[1][2][3] At Scripps, where he moved in 1957, he directed a program that used his war-surplus flux magnetometers to measure the patterns formed by the Earth's magnetic field on the sea floor; his discovery of large shifts in the patterns in the Mendocino Fracture Zone was a major impetus behind the theory of plate tectonics,[1][2][3][8] which his later measurements of heat flow on the sea floor also strongly supported.[1][2]\n For his researches, Vacquier was awarded the John Price Wetherill Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1960, the Albatross Award of the American Miscellaneous Society in 1963, the John Adam Fleming Medal of the American Geophysical Union in 1973, the Reginald Fessenden Award of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists in 1976,[3] and the Alexander Agassiz Medal of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1995 \u201cfor his discovery of the flux-gate magnetometer, and for the marine magnetic anomaly surveys that led to the acceptance of the theory of sea-floor spreading.\u201d[2][9] He died in La Jolla, California on January 11, 2009.[2]\n Vacquier's son, Victor D. Vacquier, is also a professor at Scripps, where he studies marine reproductive biology.[1][2][10]\n ", "tags": ["American geophysicists", "Russian centenarians", "American oceanographers", "University of California, San Diego faculty", "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College of Engineering alumni", "New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology faculty", "Columbia University staff", "People from Saint Petersburg", "1907 births", "2009 deaths", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American geophysicist\nVictor Vacquier, Sr. (October 13, 1907 \u2013 January 11, 2009) was a professor of geophysics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.[1][2]\nVacquier was born in St. Petersburg, Russia.
