{"name": "Horst Schubert", "content": "Horst Schubert (11 June 1919 \u2013 2001)[1] was a German mathematician.\n Schubert was born in Chemnitz and studied mathematics and physics at the Universities of Frankfurt am Main, Z\u00fcrich and Heidelberg, where in 1948 he received his PhD under Herbert Seifert with thesis Die eindeutige Zerlegbarkeit eines Knotens in Primknoten.[2][3] From 1948 to 1956 Schubert was an assistant in Heidelberg, where he received in 1952 his habilitation qualification.
