{"name": "Barry Simon", "content": "Barry Martin Simon  (born 16 April 1946)  is an American mathematical physicist and the IBM Professor of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Caltech,[1] known for his prolific contributions in spectral theory, functional analysis, and nonrelativistic quantum mechanics (particularly Schr\u00f6dinger operators), including the connections to atomic and molecular physics. He has authored more than 400 publications on mathematics and physics.\n His work has focused on broad areas of mathematical physics and analysis covering: quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, Brownian motion, random matrix theory, general nonrelativistic quantum mechanics (including N-body systems and resonances), nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in electric and magnetic fields, the semi-classical limit, the singular continuous spectrum, random and ergodic Schr\u00f6dinger operators, orthogonal polynomials, and non-selfadjoint spectral theory.[2]\n Barry Simon's mother was a school teacher, his father was an accountant. Simon attended James Madison High School in Brooklyn.[3][4]\n During his high school years, Simon started attending college courses for highly gifted pupils at Columbia University. In 1962, Simon won a MAA mathematics competition. The New York Times reported that in order to receive full credits for a faultless test result he had to make a submission with MAA. In this submission he proved that one of the problems posed in the test was ambiguous.[4][2]\n In 1962, Simon entered Harvard with a stipend. He became a Putnam Fellow in 1965 at 19 years old. He received his A.B. in 1966 from Harvard College and his Ph.D. in Physics at Princeton University in 1970, supervised by Arthur Strong Wightman. His dissertation dealt with Quantum mechanics for Hamiltonians defined as quadratic forms.[2]\n Following his doctoral studies, Simon took a professorship at Princeton for several years, often working with colleague Elliott H. Lieb on the Thomas-Fermi Theory and Hartree-Fock Theory of atoms in addition to phase transitions and mentoring many of the same students as Lieb. He eventually was persuaded to take a post at Caltech, from which he retired in the summer of 2016.[2][5]\n His status is legendary in mathematical physics and he is renowned for his ability to write scientific manuscripts \"in five percent of the time ordinary mortals need to write such papers.\"[6]\n A former graduate student of Simon's, in a tale revealing of his brilliance, once stated: \n Barry has always been remarkable for his vast knowledge of mathematics, so it was many years before I can recall ever telling him a published theorem he didn't already know. One day I saw Barry in Princeton shortly after a meeting and told him about an old inequality for PDEs, which, as I could tell from his intent look, was new to him. I said, \"It seems to be useful. Do you want to see the proof?\" His response \"No, that's OK.\" Then he went to the board and wrote down a flawless proof on the spot.[7] [8]\n ", "tags": ["1946 births", "Living people", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American physicists", "Jewish American physicists", "American Jews", "Harvard University alumni", "Princeton University alumni", "Princeton University faculty", "California Institute of Technology faculty", "Putnam Fellows", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Mathematical physicists", "Operator theorists", "James Madison High School (Brooklyn) alumni", "Mathematicians from New York (state)", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Fellows of the American Physical Society", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nFor the Australian politician, see Barry Simon (politician).\nBarry SimonBorn16 April 1946\u00a0(1946-04-16) (age\u00a074)New York CityEducationA.B., Harvard University Ph.D., Princeton UniversityEmployerCaltechTitleProfessorSpouse(s)Martha SimonAwardsHenri Poincar\u00e9 Prize (2012)Bolyai Prize (2015)  Steele Prize (2016)\nJames Madison Wall of Distinction (2016)\nBarry Martin Simon  (born 16 April 1946)  is an American mathematical physicist and the IBM Professor of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Caltech,[1] known for his prolific contributions in spectral theory, functional analysis, and nonrelativistic quantum mechanics (particularly Schr\u00f6dinger operators), including the connections to atomic and molecular physics.
