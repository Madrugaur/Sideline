She earned a second master's degree in mathematics at the University of Arizona in 1994, and completed Ph.D. in educational mathematics at the University of Northern Colorado in 1996.[5]\n Soto worked at the University of Southern Colorado from 1989 to 1992 as director of the Mathematics Learning Center. In 1995, she became an assistant professor of mathematics at the university, earning tenure there as an associate professor in 2001; the university became known as Colorado State University\u2013Pueblo in 2003. In 2005 she moved to the University of Northern Colorado, taking a step down to become an assistant professor again. She was promoted to associate professor in 2008 and to full professor in 2014,[5] before moving to Colorado State University as a professor of mathematics.[6]\n At the University of Northern Colorado, Soto founded and directed a summer program for high school girls, Las Chicas de Matem\u00e1ticas: UNC Math Camp for Young Women, from 2008 to 2014,[2][3][7] and returned to rural Nebraska to participate in a teacher education program there, Math in the Middle.[3] She is a fellow of Project NExT, and has been governor of the Rocky Mountain Section of the Mathematical Association of America.[2] She is also a principal investigator of the Embodied Mathematical Imagination & Cognition project.[8]\n In 2001, Chadron State College gave Soto their Distinguished Young Alumni Award.[4]\n In 2012, the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) gave Soto their Meritorious Service Award.[2][5] She was the 2016 winner of the Burton W.
