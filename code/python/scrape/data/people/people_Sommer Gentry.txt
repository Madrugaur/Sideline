{"name": "Sommer Gentry", "content": "Sommer Elizabeth Gentry is an American mathematician who works as a professor of mathematics at the United States Naval Academy and as a research associate in surgery at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Her research concerns operations research and its applications to the optimization of organ transplants,[1] and has led to the discovery of geographic inequities in organ allocation.[2] She is also interested in dancing, teaches swing dancing at the Naval Academy,[3] and wrote her doctoral dissertation on the mathematics and robotics of dance.[4]\n Gentry is originally from California.[5] As a girl, she was inspired to continue in mathematics by the recreational mathematics columns of Martin Gardner and Ivars Peterson.[6] In 1993, as a senior at Thousand Oaks High School, Gentry had the highest individual score at the Ventura County, California county-level Academic Decathlon.[7]\nShe graduated from Stanford University in 1998, with both a bachelor's degree in mathematical and computational sciences and a master's degree in engineering-economic systems and operations research.\n She completed her Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2005.[1] Her dissertation, Dancing cheek to cheek: haptic communication between partner dancers and swing as a finite state machine, was supervised by Eric Feron.[4] In her doctoral research, she modeled the language and notation of dance mathematically using finite state machines, programmed a robot to dance,[8] and used her model to improve haptic communications between humans and robots, with the goal of eventually producing human-machine surgical collaborations that could be more effective than human or robotic surgeons working alone.[9][10]\n Gentry is married to Israeli surgeon Dorry Segev.
