{"name": "Charles Loewner", "content": "Charles Loewner (29 May 1893 \u2013 8 January 1968) was an American mathematician. His name was Karel L\u00f6wner in Czech and Karl L\u00f6wner in German.\n Karl Loewner was born into a Jewish family in Lany, about 30\u00a0km from Prague, where his father Sigmund L\u00f6wner was a store owner.[1][2]\n Loewner received his Ph.D. from the University of Prague in 1917 under supervision of Georg Pick.\nOne of his central mathematical contributions is the proof of the Bieberbach conjecture in the first highly nontrivial case of the third coefficient. The technique he introduced, the Loewner differential equation, has had far-reaching implications in geometric function theory; it was used in the final solution of the Bieberbach conjecture by Louis de Branges in 1985. Loewner worked at the University of Berlin, University of Prague, University of Louisville, Brown University, Syracuse University and eventually at Stanford University. His students include Lipman Bers, Roger Horn, Adriano Garsia, and P. M. Pu.\n In 1949 Loewner proved his torus inequality, to the effect that every metric on the 2-torus satisfies the optimal inequality\n where sys is its systole. The boundary case of equality is attained if and only if the metric is flat and homothetic to the so-called equilateral torus, i.e. torus whose group of deck transformations is precisely the hexagonal lattice spanned by the cube roots of unity in \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} }\n\n.\n The Loewner matrix (in linear algebra) is a square matrix or, more specifically, a linear operator (of real \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C^{1}}\n\n functions) associated with 2 input parameters consisting of (1) a real continuously differentiable function on a subinterval of the real numbers and (2) an \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-dimensional vector with elements chosen from the subinterval; the 2 input parameters are assigned an output parameter consisting of an \n\n\n\nn\n\u00d7\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n\\times n}\n\n matrix.[3]\n Let \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n be a real-valued function that is continuously differentiable on the open interval \n\n\n\n(\na\n,\nb\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (a,b)}\n\n.\n For any \n\n\n\ns\n,\nt\n\u2208\n(\na\n,\nb\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s,t\\in (a,b)}\n\n define the divided difference of \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n at \n\n\n\ns\n,\nt\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s,t}\n\n as\n Given \n\n\n\n\nt\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nt\n\nn\n\n\n\u2208\n(\na\n,\nb\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t_{1},\\ldots ,t_{n}\\in (a,b)}\n\n, the Loewner matrix \n\n\n\n\nL\n\nf\n\n\n(\n\nt\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nt\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{f}(t_{1},\\ldots ,t_{n})}\n\n associated with \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n for \n\n\n\n(\n\nt\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nt\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (t_{1},\\ldots ,t_{n})}\n\n is defined as the \n\n\n\nn\n\u00d7\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n\\times n}\n\n matrix whose \n\n\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (i,j)}\n\n-entry is \n\n\n\n\nf\n\n[\n1\n]\n\n\n(\n\nt\n\ni\n\n\n,\n\nt\n\nj\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f^{[1]}(t_{i},t_{j})}\n\n.\n In his fundamental 1934 paper, Loewner proved that for each positive integer \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n, \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n is \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-monotone on \n\n\n\n(\na\n,\nb\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (a,b)}\n\n if and only if \n\n\n\n\nL\n\nf\n\n\n(\n\nt\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nt\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{f}(t_{1},\\ldots ,t_{n})}\n\n is positive semidefinite for any choice of \n\n\n\n\nt\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nt\n\nn\n\n\n\u2208\n(\na\n,\nb\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t_{1},\\ldots ,t_{n}\\in (a,b)}\n\n.[3][4][5]  Most significantly, using this equivalence, he proved that \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n is \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-monotone on \n\n\n\n(\na\n,\nb\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (a,b)}\n\n for all \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n if and only if \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n is real analytic with an analytic continuation to the upper half plane that has a positive imaginary part on the upper plane.\n \"During [Loewner's] 1955 visit to Berkeley he gave a course on continuous groups, and his lectures were reproduced in the form of duplicated notes.
