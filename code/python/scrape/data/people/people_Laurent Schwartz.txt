{"name": "Laurent Schwartz", "content": "Laurent-Mo\u00efse Schwartz (French:\u00a0[\u0283va\u0281ts]; 5 March 1915 \u2013 4 July 2002) was a French mathematician. He pioneered the theory of distributions, which gives a well-defined meaning to objects such as the Dirac delta function. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1950 for his work on the theory of distributions. For several years he taught at the \u00c9cole polytechnique.\n Laurent Schwartz came from a Jewish family of Alsatian origin, with a strong scientific background: his father was a well-known surgeon, his uncle Robert Debr\u00e9 (who contributed to the creation of UNICEF) was a famous pediatrician, and his great-uncle-in-law, Jacques Hadamard, was a famous mathematician.\n During his training at Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand to enter the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, he fell in love with Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne L\u00e9vy, daughter of the probabilist Paul L\u00e9vy who was then teaching at the \u00c9cole polytechnique. Later they would have two children, Marc-Andr\u00e9 and Claudine. Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was gifted in mathematics as well, as she contributed to the geometry of singular analytic spaces and taught at the University of Lille.\n Angelo Guerraggio describes \"Mathematics, politics and butterflies\" as his \"three great loves\".[1]\n According to his teachers, Schwartz was an exceptional student. He was particularly gifted in Latin, Greek and mathematics. One of his teachers told his parents: \"Beware, some will say your son has a gift for languages, but he is only interested in the scientific and mathematical aspect of languages: he should become a mathematician.\"\n In 1934, he was admitted at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and in 1937 he obtained the agr\u00e9gation (with rank 2).\n As a man of Trotskyist affinities and Jewish descent, life was difficult for Schwartz during World War II. He had to hide and change his identity to avoid being deported after Nazi Germany overran France. He worked for the University of Strasbourg (which had been relocated in Clermont-Ferrand because of the war) under the name of Laurent-Marie S\u00e9limartin, while Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne used the name Leng\u00e9 instead of L\u00e9vy. Unlike other mathematicians at Clermont-Ferrand such as Feldbau, the couple managed to escape the Nazis.\n Schwartz taught mainly at \u00c9cole Polytechnique, from 1958 to 1980. At the end of the war, he spent one year in Grenoble (1944), then in 1945 joined the University of Nancy on the advice of Jean Delsarte and Jean Dieudonn\u00e9, where he spent seven years. He was both an influential researcher and teacher, with students such as Bernard Malgrange, Jacques-Louis Lions, Fran\u00e7ois Bruhat and Alexander Grothendieck. He joined the science faculty of the University of Paris in 1952. In 1958 he became a teacher at the \u00c9cole polytechnique after having at first refused this position. From 1961 to 1963 the \u00c9cole polytechnique suspended his right to teach, because of his having signed the Manifesto of the 121 about the Algerian war, a gesture not appreciated by Polytechnique's military administration. However, Schwartz had a lasting influence on mathematics at the \u00c9cole polytechnique, having reorganized both teaching and research there. In 1965 he established the Centre de math\u00e9matiques Laurent-Schwartz (CMLS) as its first director.\n In 1973 he was elected corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences, and was promoted to full membership in 1975.\n In 1950 at the ICM, Schwartz was a plenary speaker[2] and was awarded the Fields Medal  for his work on distributions. He was the first French mathematician to receive the Fields medal. Because of his sympathy for Trotskyism, Schwartz encountered serious problems trying to enter the United States to receive the medal; however, he was ultimately successful.\n The theory of distributions clarified the (then) mysteries of the Dirac delta function and Heaviside step function. It helps to extend the theory of Fourier transforms and is now of critical importance to the theory of partial differential equations.\n Throughout his life, Schwartz actively worked to promote science and bring it closer to the general audience. Schwartz said: \"What are mathematics helpful for? Mathematics are helpful for physics. Physics helps us make fridges. Fridges are made to contain spiny lobsters, and spiny lobsters help mathematicians who eat them and have hence better abilities to do mathematics, which are helpful for physics, which helps us make fridges which...\"[3]\n His mother, who was passionate about natural science, passed on her taste for entomology to Laurent. His \npersonal collection of 20,000 Lepidoptera specimens, collected during his various travels was bequeathed to the\nMus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle), the Science Museum of Lyon, the Museum of Toulouse and the Museo de Historia Natural Alcide d\u2019Orbigny in Cochabamba (Bolivia). Several species discovered by Schwartz bear his name.\n Apart from his scientific work, Schwartz was a well-known outspoken intellectual. As a young socialist influenced by Leon Trotsky, Schwartz opposed the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union, particularly under Joseph Stalin. Schwartz ultimately rejected Trotskyism for democratic socialism.\n On his religious views, Schwartz called himself an atheist.[4]\n Research articles\n Technical books\n Seminar notes\n Popular books\n ", "tags": ["1915 births", "2002 deaths", "20th-century French mathematicians", "20th-century zoologists", "21st-century French mathematicians", "People from Paris", "French atheists", "French entomologists", "French Jews", "Fields Medalists", "Jewish atheists", "Nicolas Bourbaki", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni", "Grenoble Alpes University faculty", "University of Paris faculty", "University of Lorraine faculty", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "CS1: long volume value", "Webarchive template archiveis links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "French mathematician (1915\u20132002)\nNot to be confused with Hermann Schwarz.\nThis article is about the mathematician.
