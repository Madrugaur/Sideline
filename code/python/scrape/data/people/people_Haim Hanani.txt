He emigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine, later to become Israel, in 1935 and in 1938 received the first Ph.D. in Mathematics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n In 1955 he was appointed to the faculty at Technion Institute of Technology and from 1969 to 1973 he served as the rector of Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba.
