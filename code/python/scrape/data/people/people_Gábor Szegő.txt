{"name": "G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151", "content": "G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151 (Hungarian:\u00a0[\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0bor \u02c8s\u025b\u0261\u00f8\u02d0]) (January 20, 1895 \u2013 August 7, 1985) was a Hungarian-American mathematician. He was one of the foremost mathematical analysts of his generation and made fundamental contributions to the theory of orthogonal polynomials and Toeplitz matrices building on the work of his contemporary Otto Toeplitz.\n Szeg\u0151 was born in Kunhegyes, Austria-Hungary (today Hungary), into a Jewish family as the son of Adolf Szeg\u0151 and Hermina Neuman.[1] He married the chemist Anna Elisabeth Nem\u00e9nyi in 1919, with whom he had two children.\n In 1912 he started studies in mathematical physics at the University of Budapest, with summer visits to the University of Berlin and the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he attended lectures by Frobenius and Hilbert, amongst others. In Budapest he was taught mainly by Fej\u00e9r, Beke, K\u00fcrsch\u00e1k and Bauer[2] and made the acquaintance of his future collaborators George P\u00f3lya and Michael Fekete. His studies were interrupted in 1915 by World War I, in which he served in the infantry, artillery and air corps.\nIn 1918 while stationed in Vienna, he was awarded a doctorate by the University of Vienna for his work on Toeplitz determinants.[3][4] He received his Privat-Dozent from the University of Berlin in 1921, where he stayed until being appointed as successor to Knopp at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg in 1926.  Intolerable working conditions during the Nazi regime resulted in a temporary position at the Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri in 1936, before his appointment as chairman of the mathematics department at Stanford University in 1938, where he helped build up the department until his retirement in 1966.  He died in Palo Alto, California. His doctoral students include Paul Rosenbloom and Joseph Ullman.\n Szeg\u0151's most important work was in analysis. He was one of the foremost analysts of his generation and made fundamental contributions to the theory of Toeplitz matrices and orthogonal polynomials. He wrote over 130 papers in several languages. Each of his four books, several written in collaboration with others, has become a classic in its field. The monograph Orthogonal polynomials, published in 1939, contains much of his research and has had a profound influence in many areas of applied mathematics, including theoretical physics, stochastic processes and numerical analysis.\n At the age of 15, the young John von Neumann, recognised as a mathematical prodigy, was sent to study advanced calculus under Szeg\u0151. On their first meeting, Szeg\u0151 was so astounded by von Neumann's mathematical talent and speed that he was brought to tears.[5]  Szeg\u0151 subsequently visited the von Neumann house twice a week to tutor the child prodigy. Some of von Neumann's instant solutions to the problems in calculus posed by Szeg\u0151, sketched out on his father's stationery, are now on display at the von Neumann archive at Budapest.[6]\n Amongst the many honours received during his lifetime were:\n ", "tags": ["1895 births", "1985 deaths", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Hungarian emigrants to the United States", "Hungarian Jews", "Mathematical analysts", "People from Kunhegyes", "Stanford University Department of Mathematics faculty", "Washington University in St. Louis faculty", "Washington University in St. Louis mathematicians", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151 (Hungarian:\u00a0[\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0bor \u02c8s\u025b\u0261\u00f8\u02d0]) (January 20, 1895 \u2013 August 7, 1985) was a Hungarian-American mathematician.
