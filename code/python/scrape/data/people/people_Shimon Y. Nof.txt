He has held visiting positions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at universities in Chile, the European Union, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Philippines, Taiwan, and UK. He is the Director of the Production, Robotics and Integration Software for the Manufacturing & Management (PRISM) Center at Purdue.[1]\n Nof received his B.Sc. in 1969 and M.Sc. in 1972 in Industrial Engineering & Management (Human-machine systems) from the Technion in Haifa, Israel, and his Ph.D. in Industrial & Operations Engineering (Production Analytics) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1976.\n Nof has conducted research on collaborative e-Work and e-Service in multi-enterprise networks, integrated production and service systems, and decision support \u2014 as well as design of cyber-physical systems for managing distributed activities by collaborative multi-agent teams. His research pioneered the development of knowledge-based, computer-integrated facility design and robotics control models. His current research focus is on computer-supported integration \nand collaboration of distributed e-work, robotics, and cyber-physical work. Nof has developed and teaches the courses \"Industrial Robotics and Flexible Assembly\", \"Cyber Methods in Production \nControl\", \"Integrated Production Systems I and II\", \"I.E. Computing\", and \"Design of E-work, E-service, and CPS\".\n In 1999, Nof was listed in the inaugural group of Purdue's Book of Great Teachers.
