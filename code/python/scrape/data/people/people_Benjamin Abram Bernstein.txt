{"name": "Benjamin Abram Bernstein", "content": "Benjamin Abram Bernstein (20 May 1881, Pasvalys, Lithuania \u2013 25 September 1964, Berkeley, California) was an American mathematician, specializing in mathematical logic.[1]\n With his Jewish[2] family, Bernstein immigrated as a child to the United States. After completing public primary education in 1897 in Baltimore, he completed in 1902 his secondary education at Baltimore City College, and then received in 1905 his A.B. degree from Johns Hopkins University. After completing two years of graduate study at Johns Hopkins University, he became in 1907 an instructor and continuing graduate student in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. There he received in 1913, with supervisor Mellen W. Haskell, his Ph.D.[3] At Berkeley, Bernstein became in 1918 an assistant professor, in 1923 an associate professor, and in 1928 a full professor of mathematics, retiring in 1951 as professor emeritus.[1]\n When Professor Bernstein began his studies in mathematics, the subject of algebra of logic, or mathematical logic, was just beginning to receive intensive scholarly study, mainly from philosophers. Along with E. V. Huntington of Harvard, Professor Bernstein was a pioneer in this field from the mathematical point of view. ... During this early period in the history of mathematical logic, a notable event for the subject was the publication of Principia Mathematica, by Whitehead and Russell. Professor Bernstein was an intensive and critical student of this Principia and discussed it in many papers.[1] He was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in 1924 in Toronto.[4] His doctoral students include Robert Levit[3][5] and J.C.C. McKinsey.\n In June 1920 in New York City, Professor Bernstein married Rose Davidson; her brother was the famous sculptor Jo Davidson. Bernstein was predeceased by his wife and upon his death was survived by a daughter and a granddaughter.[1]\n ", "tags": ["1881 births", "1964 deaths", "Mathematical logicians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Baltimore City College alumni", "Johns Hopkins University alumni", "University of California, Berkeley alumni", "University of California, Berkeley College of Letters and Science faculty", "American people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nBenjamin Abram Bernstein (20 May 1881, Pasvalys, Lithuania \u2013 25 September 1964, Berkeley, California) was an American mathematician, specializing in mathematical logic.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Selected publications\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nWith his Jewish[2] family, Bernstein immigrated as a child to the United States.
