{"name": "Kate Okikiolu", "content": "Kate Adebola Okikiolu (born 1965) is a British mathematician.[2] She is known for her work with elliptic differential operators as well as her work with inner-city children.\n Okikiolu was born in 1965 in England. Her father was George Olatokunbo Okikiolu, a renowned Nigerian mathematician and the most published black mathematician on record.[3] Her British mother was a high school mathematics teacher. Okikiolu received a B.A. in mathematics from Cambridge University in 1987. In 1991 she earned her Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California at Los Angeles, for her thesis The Analogue of the Strong Szego Limit Theorem on the Torus and the 3-Sphere.[3][4][5]\n Based on her PhD work, Okikiolu resolved a conjecture of Peter Wilcox Jones concerning a continuous version of the travelling salesman problem, in her paper Characterization of subsets of rectifiable curves in Rn.[6]\nOkikiolu was an instructor and later assistant professor at Princeton University from 1993 to 1995. She then worked as a visiting assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and joined the faculty at the University of California at San Diego in 1995.[4] In 2011 she joined the Mathematics Department at Johns Hopkins University.\n She was an invited speaker at the 1996 meeting of the Association of Women in Mathematics. She also delivered the Claytor-Woodard lecture at the 2002 meeting of the National Association of Mathematicians, an organization for African-American mathematicians.[4]\n In 1997 won a Sloan Research Fellowship,[7] becoming the first black recipient of this fellowship. In 1997 she also was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for both her mathematical research and her development of mathematics curricula for inner-city school children. This award is given to only 60 scientists and engineers each year and has a prize of $500,000.[4]\n ", "tags": ["1965 births", "Living people", "Black British academics", "20th-century British mathematicians", "21st-century British mathematicians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Alumni of the University of Cambridge", "English people of Nigerian descent", "English people of Yoruba descent", "Yoruba women scientists", "Yoruba women academics", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty", "University of California, San Diego faculty", "British emigrants to the United States", "American people of Nigerian descent", "American people of Yoruba descent", "African-American academics", "Johns Hopkins University faculty", "Princeton University faculty", "Nigerian women academics", "British women academics", "American women mathematicians", "African-American mathematicians", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "University of California, Los Angeles alumni", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers"], "raw": "Kate Adebola OkikioluBorn1965 (age\u00a055\u201356)NationalityBritishAlma\u00a0materUniversity of CambridgeUCLAAwardsPresidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers[1]Scientific careerFieldsMathematical analysisElliptic operatorsInstitutionsPrinceton UniversityUCSDJohns Hopkins UniversityThesisThe Analogue of the Strong Szego Limit Theorem on the Torus and the 3-Sphere\u00a0(1991)Doctoral advisorsSun-Yung Alice ChangJohn B.
