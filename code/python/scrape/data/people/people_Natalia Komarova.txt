{"name": "Natalia Komarova", "content": "\n Natalia L. Komarova (born 1971) is a Russian-American applied mathematician whose research concerns the mathematical modeling of cancer,[1] the evolution of language,[2] gun control,[3] pop music,[4][5] and other complex systems. She is a Chancellor's Professor of Mathematics at the University of California, Irvine.[6]\n Komarova studied physics at Moscow State University, earning a master's degree there in 1993.[7] She completed her Ph.D. in 1998 at the University of Arizona. Her dissertation, Essays on Nonlinear Waves: Patterns under Water; Pulse Propagation through Random Media, was supervised by Alan C. Newell.[8]\n After postdoctoral research at the University of Warwick, the Institute for Advanced Study, and the University of Chicago, Komarova became a lecturer at the University of Leeds in 2000. She moved to Rutgers University in 2003 and to the University of California, Irvine in 2004. At UC Irvine, she was named a Chancellor's Professor in 2017.[7]\n Komarova won a Sloan Research Fellowship in 2005.[9]\n Komarova is married to UC Irvine evolutionary biologist Dominik Wodarz.[3] She has written three books with Wodarz:\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "Russian mathematicians", "Moscow State University alumni", "University of Arizona alumni", "Academics of the University of Leeds", "Rutgers University faculty", "University of California, Irvine faculty", "Sloan Research Fellows", "1971 births", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from January 2021", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers"], "raw": "Russian-American applied mathematician\nThis article is about the mathematician.
