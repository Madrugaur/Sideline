De Morgan came to know of Ramchundra when, in 1850, he was sent by a friend to work on maxima and minima by the 29-year-old self-taught mathematician. Ramchundra had published his book at his own expense in Calcutta in that year. De Morgan arranged for the book to be republished in London under his own supervision.\n De Morgan was so impressed that he undertook to bring Ramchundra's work to the notice of scientific men of Europe.\n Charles Muses, in an article in the Mathematical Intelligencer (1998) called Ramchundra \"De Morgan's Ramanujan\".
