{"name": "Stanis\u0142aw Zaremba (mathematician)", "content": "Stanis\u0142aw Zaremba (3 October 1863 \u2013 23 November 1942) was a Polish mathematician and engineer.[1] His research in partial differential equations, applied mathematics and classical analysis, particularly on harmonic functions, gained him a wide recognition. He was one of the mathematicians who contributed to the success of the Polish School of Mathematics through his teaching and organizational skills as well as through his research. Apart from his research works, Zaremba wrote many university textbooks and monographies.\n He was a professor of the Jagiellonian University (since 1900), member of Academy of Learning (since 1903), co-founder and president of the Polish Mathematical Society (1919).\n He should not be confused with his son Stanis\u0142aw Zaremba junior, also a mathematician.\n Zaremba was born on 3 October 1863 in Roman\u00f3wka, present-day Ukraine. The son of an engineer,[1] he was educated at a grammar school in Saint Petersburg and studied at the Institute of Technology of the same city obtaining is diploma in engineering in 1886.[1] The same year he left Saint Petersburg and went to Paris to study mathematics: he received his degree from the Sorbonne in 1889.[1] He stayed in France until 1900, when he joined the faculty at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w. His years in France enabled him to establish a strong bridge between Polish mathematicians and those in France.\n He died on 23 November 1942 in Krak\u00f3w, during the German occupation of Poland.\n Zaremba's magneficent discoveries found a broad response and deep appreciation in the world. Stanis\u0142aw Zaremba is the pride of Polish science. At the same time, by his pioneering activity in such an important field as mathematical analysis, he became one of the creators of modern Polish mathematics.
