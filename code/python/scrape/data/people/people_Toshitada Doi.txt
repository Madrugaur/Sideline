He received a degree in electrical engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1964, and a PhD from Tohoku University in 1972.\n He joined Sony Japan in 1964 and started the first digital audio project within Sony. He was the driving force behind the PCM adaptor, and was a prominent member of the Sony/Philips taskforce responsible for the design of the Compact Disc.[1] He created, among others, the CIRC error correction system.[2] He, with Kees Immink, refutes the myth that the Compact Disc's playing time was determined by Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.[3]\n He was the lead engineer of the DASH multi-track digital audio tape recorder.[4] In the 1990s, he headed Sony's Digital Creatures Laboratory, where he was responsible for the Aibo,[5] Sony's robotic dog. In 2003, Doi created the Qrio, a running humanoid robot.\n ", "tags": ["Japanese engineers", "Japanese inventors", "Living people", "1943 births", "Tokyo Institute of Technology alumni", "Tohoku University alumni", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "Articles with short description", "Articles with short description added by PearBOT 5", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Japanese-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Japanese electrical engineer\nToshitada DoiBorn (1943-02-02) February 2, 1943 (age\u00a078)JapanAlma\u00a0materTokyo Institute of TechnologyTohoku UniversityOccupationEngineer\nToshitada Doi (\u571f\u4e95 \u5229\u5fe0, Doi Toshitada, born February 2, 1943) is a Japanese electrical engineer, who played a significant role in the digital audio revolution.
