{"name": "Amos E. Joel Jr.", "content": "Amos Edward Joel Jr. (March 12, 1918 \u2013 October 25, 2008)[1] was an American electrical engineer, known for several contributions and over seventy patents related to telecommunications switching systems.\n Joel was born in Philadelphia, and spent portions of his youth living in New York City, where he graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx.[2]\n He earned his B.Sc. (1940) and M.Sc. (1942) in electrical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he worked on the Rockefeller Differential Analyzer (project headed by Vannevar Bush), and a thesis on functional design of relays and switch circuits, advised by Samuel H. Caldwell.\nJoel worked at Bell Labs (1940\u201383) where he first undertook cryptology studies (collaboration with Claude Shannon), followed by studies on electronic switching system that resulted in the 1ESS switch (1948\u201360). He then headed the development of advanced telephone services (1961\u201368), which led to several patents, including one on Traffic Service Position System[3] and a mechanism for handoff in cellular communication (1972).[4] The latter invention made mobile telephony widely available by allowing a multitude of callers to use the limited number of available frequencies simultaneously and by allowing the seamless switching of calls from tower to tower as callers traveled.  After 1983, he worked as a consultant to AT&T, developing mechanisms for optical switching.[5]\n Joel died in his home in Maplewood, New Jersey, on October 25, 2008, at age 90.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1918 births", "2008 deaths", "American electrical engineers", "Fellow Members of the IEEE", "IEEE Medal of Honor recipients", "Kyoto laureates in Advanced Technology", "MIT School of Engineering alumni", "National Medal of Technology recipients", "People from Maplewood, New Jersey", "Scientists from Philadelphia", "Scientists at Bell Labs", "People from the Bronx", "Jewish American scientists", "Jewish inventors", "DeWitt Clinton High School alumni", "Articles needing additional references from October 2008", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.
