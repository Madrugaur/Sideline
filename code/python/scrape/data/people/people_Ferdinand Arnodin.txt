{"name": "Ferdinand Arnodin", "content": " Ferdinand Joseph Arnodin  (9 October 1845 \u2013 24 April 1924) was a French engineer and industrialist born in Sainte-Foy-l\u00e8s-Lyon, Rh\u00f4ne who died in Ch\u00e2teauneuf-sur-Loire in Loiret. Specialising in cableway transporters, he is regarded as the inventor of the transporter bridge, having been the first to patent the idea in 1887.[1] However, the first such bridge was in fact designed by Alberto Palacio, with Arnodin's help.\n Nine of the eighteen known examples of the transporter bridge may be attributed to him. Three of them still exist. They use the technology of both suspension bridges and cable-stayed bridges. Arnodin built a great number of second generation suspension bridges at the turn of the 20th century, and he also restored and consolidated a number of old first generation suspension bridges (before 1860): the aprons were reinforced and the old wire cables replaced by spirally-wound double torsion steel wire ropes, often with addition of a cable-stayed bridge (known structural modification under the name of \u201cSyst\u00e8me Arnodin\u201d). His factory (for the production of prefabricated metal sub-structures) was established in Ch\u00e2teauneuf-sur-Loire. Vestiges of this factory were still visible a few years ago, and the chimney could still be seen, half ruined, between the Loire and railway.\n The Loire Fleet Museum, at Ch\u00e2teauneuf-sur-Loire, shows memories of these workshops: an old model of the Nantes transporter bridge, a section of steel wire rope manufactured by Arnodin and photographs.\n ", "tags": ["1845 births", "1924 deaths", "People from Sainte-Foy-l\u00e8s-Lyon", "French bridge engineers", "French civil engineers", "Transporter bridges", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers"], "raw": " Ferdinand Joseph Arnodin  (9 October 1845 \u2013 24 April 1924) was a French engineer and industrialist born in Sainte-Foy-l\u00e8s-Lyon, Rh\u00f4ne who died in Ch\u00e2teauneuf-sur-Loire in Loiret.
