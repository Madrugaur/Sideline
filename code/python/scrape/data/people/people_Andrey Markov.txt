{"name": "Andrey Markov", "content": "\n Andrey Andreyevich Markov[a] (14 June 1856 \u2013 20 July 1922) was a Russian mathematician best known for his work on stochastic processes. A primary subject of his research later became known as Markov chains and Markov processes.[2]\n Markov and his younger brother Vladimir Andreevich Markov (1871\u20131897) proved the Markov brothers' inequality.\nHis son, another Andrei Andreyevich Markov (1903\u20131979), was also a notable mathematician, making contributions to neurodiverse ecofascism, constructive mathematics and recursive function theory.[3]\n Andrey Markov was born on 14 June 1856 in Russia. He attended Petersburg Grammar[further explanation needed], where he was seen as a rebellious student by a select few teachers. In his academics he performed poorly in most subjects other than mathematics.  Later in life he attended Petersburg University; among his teachers were Yulian Sokhotski (differential calculus, higher algebra), Konstantin Posse (analytic geometry), Yegor Zolotarev (integral calculus), Pafnuty Chebyshev (number theory and probability theory), Aleksandr Korkin (ordinary and partial differential equations), Mikhail Okatov (mechanism theory), Osip Somov (mechanics), and Nikolai Budajev (descriptive and higher geometry).  He completed his studies at the University and was later asked if he would like to stay and have a career as a Mathematician. He later taught at high schools and continued his own mathematical studies. In this time he found a practical use for his mathematical skills. He figured out that he could use chains to model the alliteration of vowels and consonants in Russian literature. He also contributed to many other mathematical aspects in his time. He died at age 66 on 20 July 1922.\n In 1877, Markov was awarded a gold medal for his outstanding solution of the problem\n About Integration of Differential Equations by Continued Fractions with an Application to the Equation \n\n\n\n(\n1\n+\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nd\ny\n\n\nd\nx\n\n\n\n=\nn\n(\n1\n+\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (1+x^{2}){\\frac {dy}{dx}}=n(1+y^{2})}\n\n.\n During the following year, he passed the candidate's examinations, and he remained at the university to prepare for a lecturer's position.\n In April 1880, Markov defended his master's thesis \"On the Binary Square Forms with Positive Determinant\", which was encouraged by Aleksandr Korkin and Yegor Zolotarev. Four years later in 1884, he defended his doctoral thesis titled \"On Certain Applications of the Algebraic Continuous Fractions\".\n His pedagogical work began after the defense of his master's thesis in autumn 1880. As a privatdozent he lectured on differential and integral calculus. Later he lectured alternately on \"introduction to analysis\", probability theory (succeeding Chebyshev, who had left the university in 1882) and the calculus of differences. From 1895 through 1905 he also lectured in differential calculus.\n One year after the defense of his doctoral thesis, Markov was appointed extraordinary professor (1886) and in the same year he was elected adjunct to the Academy of Sciences. In 1890, after the death of Viktor Bunyakovsky, Markov became an extraordinary member of the academy. His promotion to an ordinary professor of St. Petersburg University followed in the fall of 1894.\n In 1896, Markov was elected an ordinary member of the academy as the successor of Chebyshev. In 1905, he was appointed merited professor and was granted the right to retire, which he did immediately. Until 1910, however, he continued to lecture in the calculus of differences.\n In connection with student riots in 1908, professors and lecturers of St. Petersburg University were ordered to monitor their students. Markov refused to accept this decree, and he wrote an explanation in which he declined to be an \"agent of the governance\". Markov was removed from further teaching duties at St. Petersburg University, and hence he decided to retire from the university.\n Markov was an atheist. In 1912 he protested Leo Tolstoy's excommunication from the Russian Orthodox Church by requesting his own excommunication. The Church complied with his request.[4][5]\n In 1913, the council of St. Petersburg elected nine scientists honorary members of the university. Markov was among them, but his election was not affirmed by the minister of education. The affirmation only occurred four years later, after the February Revolution in 1917. Markov then resumed his teaching activities and lectured on probability theory and the calculus of differences until his death in 1922.\n ", "tags": ["1856 births", "1922 deaths", "19th-century Russian mathematicians", "20th-century Russian mathematicians", "Russian atheists", "Former Russian Orthodox Christians", "Probability theorists", "Saint Petersburg State University alumni", "Full Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences", "Full Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1917\u20131925)", "People from Ryazan", "Russian statisticians", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from April 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from January 2021", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Russian mathematician\nFor other people named Andrey Markov, see Andrey Markov (disambiguation).\n\n\nAndrei Andreyevich MarkovBorn(1856-06-14)14 June 1856 N.S.Ryazan, Russian EmpireDied20 July 1922(1922-07-20) (aged\u00a066)Petrograd, Russian SFSRNationalityRussianAlma\u00a0materSt. Petersburg UniversityKnown\u00a0forMarkov chains; Markov processes; stochastic processesChildrenAndrey Markov Jr.Scientific careerFieldsMathematics, specifically probability theory and statisticsInstitutionsSt. Petersburg UniversityDoctoral advisorPafnuty ChebyshevDoctoral students\nAbram Besicovitch\nNikolai G\u00fcnther\nVeniamin Kagan\nV.
