He made several fundamental contributions to mathematics:\n\nA fundamental issue in algebraic geometry is intersection theory. The Chow ring has many advantages and is widely used.\nThe Chow associated forms give a description of the moduli space of the algebraic varieties in projective space. It gives a beautiful solution of an important problem.\nHis theorem that a compact analytic variety in a projective space is algebraic is justly famous. The theorem shows the close analogy between algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory.\nGeneralizing a result of Caratheodory on thermodynamics, he formulated a theorem on accessibility of differential spaces. The theorem plays a fundamental role in control theory.\nA lesser-known paper of his on homogeneous spaces gives a beautiful treatment of the geometry known as the projective geometry of matrices and treated by elaborate calculations. His discussions are valid in a more general context.\"[2]\nSee also[edit]\nChow ring\nChow's theorem\nChow's moving lemma\nChow's lemma\nChow\u2013Rashevskii theorem\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Chern, S.
