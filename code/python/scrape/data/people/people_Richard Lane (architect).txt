{"name": "Richard Lane (architect)", "content": "\n Richard Lane (3 April 1795\u00a0\u2013 25 May 1880)[1] was an English architect of the early and mid-19th century. Born in London and based in Manchester, he was known in great part for his restrained and austere Greek-inspired classicism. He also designed a few buildings\u00a0\u2013 mainly churches\u00a0\u2013 in the Gothic style.[2] He was also known for masterplanning and designing many of the houses in the exclusive Victoria Park estate.\n Not much is known about Lane's early life, but he was born and educated in London, was a Quaker[3] and in 1817, he began studying at the famous \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and was a pupil of the French architect, Achille Lecl\u00e8re,[4] who made a noted restoration of the Pantheon in 1813.[5]\n After Paris, Lane moved to Manchester in 1821, set up practice and was appointed Land Surveyor to the Police Commissioners of Chorlton Row (as was).[6][7] Much of Lane's work was civic and governmental in nature, and he was commissioned to design a town hall just off Chapel St for the Salford local government in 1825.\n Later, in 1830, the Chorlton Row Police Commissioners\u00a0\u2013 essentially the administrative body of the Chorlton Row township\u00a0\u2013 commissioned Lane to design them a town hall on Cavendish Street.  The Chorlton Town Hall was built by David Bellhouse;[8] Lane and Bellhouse would later work together on other projects.  Indeed, Lane had a close connection with the Bellhouse family, with Lane transferring his share in the Portico Library to David Bellhouse's son, Edward Taylor Bellhouse in 1834.[9] The old town hall is now used by Manchester Metropolitan University.\n Lane's notable ecclesiastical structures include the Royal Chapel of St John the Baptist, St John's, Isle of Man\u2014built after Lane's design won an architectural competition set up by the church authorities.[10] The chapel is the national church of the Isle of Man,[11][12] and functions as the seat of parliament for one day of the year;[13] St George's Church, Chester Road (with Francis Goodwin); the Church of St Mary with St Peter, Church Street, Oldham; and appropriately, the Friends' Meeting House, Mount Street, Manchester.\n Lane was one of the defendant architects in the landmark case Foss v Harbottle (1843) 67 ER 189, which established the precedent that where a wrong is alleged to have been done to a company, the proper claimant is the company itself.\n \nBy the 1830s, Richard Lane was undoubtedly Manchester's most prominent architect and in 1837, he was one of the founders\u00a0\u2013 and was the first president of\u00a0\u2013 the Manchester Architectural Society.[14] This was Manchester's first architectural learned society. A number of distinguished students were apprenticed to the practice of Richard Lane and Peter B. Alley; the most notable and celebrated being fellow Quaker, Alfred Waterhouse, who was articled to Lane and Alley in 1845.[15][16] Other distinguished students to complete articles under Richard Lane include the architect, archaeologist, and writer Richard Popplewell Pullan;[17] and the theatre architect, amateur actor, writer, and a former vice-president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Alfred Darbyshire, who developed what was known as the 'Irving-Darbyshire Safety Theatre' with his friend, the actor Henry Irving.[18]\n Richard Lane died in Ascot, Berkshire on 25 May 1880, at the age of 85.\n Manchester Victorian Architects ", "tags": ["1795 births", "1880 deaths", "Artists from London", "Architects from London", "19th-century English architects", "English Quakers", "British neoclassical architects", "British alumni of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts", "Presidents of the Manchester Society of Architects", "EngvarB from September 2014", "Use dmy dates from September 2014", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 errors: format without URL", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nRichard LaneFriends Meeting House, ManchesterBorn(1795-04-03)3 April 1795London, EnglandDied25 May 1880(1880-05-25) (aged\u00a085)Ascot, Berkshire, EnglandNationalityEnglishAlma\u00a0mater\u00c9cole des Beaux-ArtsOccupationArchitectPracticeRichard Lane & Peter B.
