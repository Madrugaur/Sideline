{"name": "Karl Christian von Langsdorf", "content": "Karl Christian von Langsdorf, also known as Carl Christian von Langsdorff (18 May 1757 in Nauheim[1] \u2013 10 June 1834 in Heidelberg), was a German mathematician, geologist, natural scientist and engineer.\n Langsdorf was the son of Georg Melchior Langsdorff and Maria Margarethe Koch. His father was saltworks archivist and Hesse-Hanau Rentmeister (master of the bursary) (saltworks of Nauheim). He had a twin brother named Daniel Isaak. After finishing Gymnasium (secondary school) in Idstein in 1773, Langsdorf studied, among other things, philosophy, law, and mathematics at University of G\u00f6ttingen from 1774 until autumn of 1776 with Abraham Gotthelf K\u00e4stner and then until 1777 at the University of Giessen. He then interned at the saltworks in Salzhausen, and subsequently devoted himself in Nidda, Hesse to the study of saltworks. He finished his doctorate in 1781 in Erfurt.\n In the summer semester of 1781, he was an outside lecturer at Giessen. For health reasons however, he decided against an academic career. He pursued a career in administration and became Rentmeister and land judge in M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr. Starting in 1784, he was active as a saltworks inspector in Gerabronn (near Rothenburg ob der Tauber), which belonged to the margravate of Ansbach at the time.\n In 1798, he was given a full professorship in mechanical engineering at Erlangen. He taught there until 1804 and he subjected the 15-year-old Georg Ohm to a thorough examination of his knowledge of mathematics. Ohm and his younger brother were instructed in mathematics by their father.\n He refused an offer from Heidelberg in 1803 and accepted an offer to teach mathematics and technology at Vilnius University. In Russia, he and his family were elevated into the hereditary aristocracy.[2] In 1806, he returned with the aristocratic descriptor von and became (with the help of his older brother Gottlieb, the governor of Dilsburg) full professor in Heidelberg.\n The mathematical physics class of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences admitted him to its ranks as a non-local member in 1808.
