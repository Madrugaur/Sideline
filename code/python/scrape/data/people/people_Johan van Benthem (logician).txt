Before becoming University Professor in 2003, he held appointments at the University of Amsterdam (1973\u20131977), at the University of Groningen (1977\u20131986), and as a professor at the University of Amsterdam (1986\u20132003).\n In 1992 he was elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[2]\n Van Benthem is known for his research in the area of modal logic. This research has resulted in Van Benthem's Theorem, which states that propositional modal logic is the fragment of first-order logic that is invariant under bisimulation.\n He has also been active in the fields of philosophy of science, logical structures in natural language (generalized quantifiers, categorial grammar, substructural proof theory), dynamic logic and update logic, and applications of logic to game theory, as well as applications of game theory to logic (game semantics). Van Benthem is a member of the group collectively publishing under the pseudonym L. T. F. Gamut. He has also taught in China.
