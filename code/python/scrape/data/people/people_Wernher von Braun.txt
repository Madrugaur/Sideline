{"name": "Wernher von Braun", "content": "\n Wernher Magnus Maximilian Freiherr von Braun (23 March 1912 \u2013 16 June 1977) was a German-born American aerospace engineer[3] and space architect. He was the leading figure in the development of rocket technology in Nazi Germany and a pioneer of rocket and space technology in the United States.[4]\n While in his twenties and early thirties, von Braun worked in Nazi Germany's rocket development program. He helped design and co-developed the V-2 rocket at Peenem\u00fcnde during World War II. Following the war he was secretly moved to the United States, along with about 1,600 other German scientists, engineers, and technicians, as part of Operation Paperclip.[5] He worked for the United States Army on an intermediate-range ballistic missile program, and he developed the rockets that launched the United States' first space satellite Explorer 1.\n In 1960, his group was assimilated into NASA, where he served as director of the newly formed Marshall Space Flight Center and as the chief architect of the Saturn V super heavy-lift launch vehicle that propelled the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon.[6][7] In 1967, von Braun was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering, and in 1975, he received the National Medal of Science. He advocated for a human mission to Mars.\n Wernher von Braun was born on 23 March 1912, in the small town of Wirsitz in the Posen Province, then the German Empire. He was the second of three sons of a noble Lutheran family. From birth he held the title of Freiherr (equivalent to Baron). The German nobility's legal privileges were abolished in 1919, although noble titles could still be used as part of the family name.[citation needed]\n His father, Magnus Freiherr von Braun (1878\u20131972), was a civil servant and conservative politician; he served as Minister of Agriculture in the federal government during the Weimar Republic. His mother, Emmy von Quistorp (1886\u20131959), traced her ancestry through both parents to medieval European royalty and was a descendant of Philip III of France, Valdemar I of Denmark, Robert III of Scotland, and Edward III of England.[8][9] Wernher had an older brother, the West German diplomat Sigismund von Braun, who served as Secretary of State in the Foreign Office in the 1970s, and a younger brother, also named Magnus von Braun, who was a rocket scientist and later a senior executive with Chrysler.[10]\n The family moved to Berlin in 1915, where his father worked at the Ministry of the Interior. After Wernher's Confirmation, his mother gave him a telescope, and he developed a passion for astronomy.[11] Here in 1924, the 12-year-old Wernher, inspired by speed records established by Max Valier and Fritz von Opel in rocket-propelled cars,[12] caused a major disruption in a crowded street by detonating a toy wagon to which he had attached fireworks. He was taken into custody by the local police until his father came to get him.\n Wernher learned to play both the cello and the piano at an early age and at one time wanted to become a composer. He took lessons from the composer Paul Hindemith. The few pieces of Wernher's youthful compositions that exist are reminiscent of Hindemith's style.[13]:11 He could play piano pieces of Beethoven and Bach from memory.\n Beginning in 1925, Wernher attended a boarding school at Ettersburg Castle near Weimar, where he did not do well in physics and mathematics. There he acquired a copy of Die Rakete zu den Planetenr\u00e4umen (1923, By Rocket into Planetary Space)[14] by rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth. In 1928, his parents moved him to the Hermann-Lietz-Internat (also a residential school) on the East Frisian North Sea island of Spiekeroog. Space travel had always fascinated Wernher, and from then on he applied himself to physics and mathematics to pursue his interest in rocket engineering.\n In 1930, von Braun attended the Technische Hochschule Berlin, where he joined the Spaceflight Society (Verein f\u00fcr Raumschiffahrt or \"VfR\") and assisted Willy Ley in his liquid-fueled rocket motor tests in conjunction with Hermann Oberth.[15] In spring 1932, he graduated with a diploma in mechanical engineering.[16] His early exposure to rocketry convinced him that the exploration of space would require far more than applications of the current engineering technology. Wanting to learn more about physics, chemistry, and astronomy, von Braun entered the Friedrich-Wilhelm University of Berlin for doctoral studies and graduated with a doctorate in physics in 1934.[12] He also studied at ETH Z\u00fcrich for a term from June to October 1931.[12] Although he worked mainly on military rockets in his later years there, space travel remained his primary interest.\n In 1930, von Braun attended a presentation given by Auguste Piccard. After the talk, the young student approached the famous pioneer of high-altitude balloon flight, and stated to him: \"You know, I plan on traveling to the Moon at some time.\" Piccard is said to have responded with encouraging words.[17]\n Von Braun was greatly influenced by Oberth, of whom he said:\n Hermann Oberth was the first who, when thinking about the possibility of spaceships, grabbed a slide-rule and presented mathematically analyzed concepts and designs ... I, myself, owe to him not only the guiding-star of my life, but also my first contact with the theoretical and practical aspects of rocketry and space travel. A place of honor should be reserved in the history of science and technology for his ground-breaking contributions in the field of astronautics.[18] According to historian Norman Davies, von Braun was able to pursue a career as a rocket scientist in Germany due to a \"curious oversight\" in the Treaty of Versailles which did not include rocketry in its list of weapons forbidden to Germany.[19]\n Von Braun had an ambivalent and complex relationship with the Nazi Third Reich.[5] He applied for membership of the Nazi Party on 12 November 1937, and was issued membership number 5,738,692.[20]:96\n Michael J. Neufeld, an author of aerospace history and chief of the Space History Division at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, wrote that ten years after von Braun obtained his Nazi Party membership, he signed an affidavit for the U.S. Army misrepresenting the year of his membership, saying incorrectly:[20]:96\n In 1939, I was officially demanded to join the National Socialist Party. At this time I was already Technical Director at the Army Rocket Center at Peenem\u00fcnde (Baltic Sea). The technical work carried out there had, in the meantime, attracted more and more attention in higher levels. Thus, my refusal to join the party would have meant that I would have to abandon the work of my life. Therefore, I decided to join. My membership in the party did not involve any political activity. It has not been ascertained whether von Braun's error with regard to the year was deliberate or a simple mistake.[20]:96 Neufeld further wrote:\n Von Braun, like other Peenem\u00fcnders, was assigned to the local group in Karlshagen; there is no evidence that he did more than send in his monthly dues. But he is seen in some photographs with the party's swastika pin in his lapel \u2013 it was politically useful to demonstrate his membership.[20]:96 Von Braun's later attitude toward the National Socialist regime of the late 1930s and early 1940s was complex. He said that he had been so influenced by the early Nazi promise of release from the post\u2013World War I economic effects, that his patriotic feelings had increased.[citation needed] In a 1952 memoir article he admitted that, at that time, he \"fared relatively rather well under totalitarianism\".[20]:96\u201397 Yet, he also wrote that \"to us, Hitler was still only a pompous fool with a Charlie Chaplin moustache\"[21] and that he perceived him as \"another Napoleon\" who was \"wholly without scruples, a godless man who thought himself the only god\".[22]\n Von Braun joined the SS horseback riding school on 1 November 1933 as an SS-Anw\u00e4rter. He left the following year.[citation needed]:63 In 1940, he joined the SS[23]:47[24] and was given the rank of Untersturmf\u00fchrer in the Allgemeine-SS and issued membership number 185,068.[citation needed]:121 In 1947, he gave the U.S. War Department this explanation:\n In spring 1940, one SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer (SS-Colonel) M\u00fcller from Greifswald, a bigger town in the vicinity of Peenem\u00fcnde, looked me up in my office ... and told me that Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Himmler had sent him with the order to urge me to join the SS. I told him I was so busy with my rocket work that I had no time to spare for any political activity. He then told me, that ... the SS would cost me no time at all. I would be awarded the rank of a[n] \"Untersturmfuehrer\" (lieutenant) and it were  [sic] a very definite desire of Himmler that I attend his invitation to join.\n I asked M\u00fcller to give me some time for reflection. He agreed.\n \nRealizing that the matter was of highly political significance for the relation between the SS and the Army, I called immediately on my military superior, Dr. Dornberger. He informed me that the SS had for a long time been trying to get their \"finger in the pie\" of the rocket work. I asked him what to do. He replied on the spot that if I wanted to continue our mutual work, I had no alternative but to join. When shown a picture of himself standing behind Himmler, von Braun claimed to have worn the SS uniform only that one time,[25] but in 2002 a former SS officer at Peenem\u00fcnde told the BBC that von Braun had regularly worn the SS uniform to official meetings. He began as an Untersturmf\u00fchrer (Second lieutenant) and was promoted three times by Himmler, the last time in June 1943 to SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer (Major). Von Braun later claimed that these were simply technical promotions received each year regularly by mail.[26]\n In 1933, von Braun was working on his creative doctorate when the Nazi Party came to power in a coalition government in Germany; rocketry was almost immediately moved onto the national agenda. An artillery captain, Walter Dornberger, arranged an Ordnance Department research grant for von Braun, who then worked next to Dornberger's existing solid-fuel rocket test site at Kummersdorf.\n Von Braun was awarded a doctorate in physics[27] (aerospace engineering) on 27 July 1934, from the University of Berlin for a thesis entitled \"About Combustion Tests\"; his doctoral supervisor was Erich Schumann.[20]:61 However, this thesis was only the public part of von Braun's work. His actual full thesis, Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket (dated 16 April 1934) was kept classified by the German army, and was not published until 1960.[28] By the end of 1934, his group had successfully launched two liquid fuel rockets that rose to heights of 2.2 and 3.5\u00a0km (2\u00a0mi).\n At the time, Germany was highly interested in American physicist Robert H. Goddard's research. Before 1939, German scientists occasionally contacted Goddard directly with technical questions. Von Braun used Goddard's plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the Aggregat (A) series of rockets. The first successful launch of an A-4 took place on 3 October 1942.[29] The A-4 rocket would become well known as the V-2.[30] In 1963, von Braun reflected on the history of rocketry, and said of Goddard's work: \"His rockets\u00a0... may have been rather crude by present-day standards, but they blazed the trail and incorporated many features used in our most modern rockets and space vehicles.\"[12]\n Goddard confirmed his work was used by von Braun in 1944, shortly before the Nazis began firing V-2s at England. A V-2 crashed in Sweden and some parts were sent to an Annapolis lab where Goddard was doing research for the Navy. If this was the so-called B\u00e4ckebo Bomb, it had been procured by the British in exchange for Spitfires; Annapolis would have received some parts from them. Goddard is reported to have recognized components he had invented, and inferred that his brainchild had been turned into a weapon.[31] Later, von Braun would comment: \"I have very deep and sincere regret for the victims of the V-2 rockets, but there were victims on both sides ... A war is a war, and when my country is at war, my duty is to help win that war.\"[32]\n In response to Goddard's claims, von Braun said \"at no time in Germany did I or any of my associates ever see a Goddard patent\". This was independently confirmed.[33] He wrote that claims about his lifting Goddard's work were the furthest from the truth, noting that Goddard's paper \"A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes\", which was studied by von Braun and Oberth, lacked the specificity of liquid-fuel experimentation with rockets.[33] It was also confirmed that he was responsible for an estimated 20 patentable innovations related to rocketry, as well as receiving U.S. patents after the war concerning the advancement of rocketry.[33] Documented accounts also stated he provided solutions to a host of aerospace engineering problems in the 1950s and 60s.[33]\n There were no German rocket societies after the collapse of the VfR, and civilian rocket tests were forbidden by the new Nazi regime. Only military development was allowed, and to this end, a larger facility was erected at the village of Peenem\u00fcnde in northern Germany on the Baltic Sea. Dornberger became the military commander at Peenem\u00fcnde, with von Braun as technical director. In collaboration with the Luftwaffe, the Peenem\u00fcnde group developed liquid-fuel rocket engines for aircraft and jet-assisted takeoffs. They also developed the long-range A-4 ballistic missile and the supersonic Wasserfall anti-aircraft missile.\n On 22 December 1942, Adolf Hitler ordered the production of the A-4 as a \"vengeance weapon\", and the Peenem\u00fcnde group developed it to target London. Following von Braun's 7 July 1943 presentation of a color movie showing an A-4 taking off, Hitler was so enthusiastic that he personally made von Braun a professor shortly thereafter.[34] In Germany at this time, this was an exceptional promotion for an engineer who was only 31 years old.[original research?]\n By that time, the British and Soviet intelligence agencies were aware of the rocket program and von Braun's team at Peenem\u00fcnde, based on the intelligence provided by the Polish underground Home Army. Over the nights of 17-18 August 1943, RAF Bomber Command's Operation Hydra dispatched raids on the Peenem\u00fcnde camp consisting of 596 aircraft, and dropped 1,800 tons of explosives.[35] The facility was salvaged and most of the engineering team remained unharmed; however, the raids killed von Braun's engine designer Walter Thiel and Chief Engineer Walther, and the rocket program was delayed.[36][37]\n The first combat A-4, renamed the V-2 (Vergeltungswaffe 2 \"Retaliation/Vengeance Weapon 2\") for propaganda purposes, was launched toward England on 7 September 1944, only 21 months after the project had been officially commissioned. Von Braun's interest in rockets was specifically for the application of space travel, not for killing people.[38] Satirist Mort Sahl has been credited with mocking von Braun by saying \"I aim at the stars, but sometimes I hit London.\"[39] That line appears in the film I Aim at the Stars, a 1960 biographical film of von Braun.\n During 1936, von Braun's rocketry team working at Kummersdorf investigated installing liquid-fuelled rockets in aircraft. Ernst Heinkel enthusiastically supported their efforts, supplying a He-72 and later two He-112s for the experiments. Later in 1936, Erich Warsitz was seconded by the RLM to von Braun and Heinkel, because he had been recognized as one of the most experienced test pilots of the time, and because he also had an extraordinary fund of technical knowledge.[40]:30 After he familiarized Warsitz with a test-stand run, showing him the corresponding apparatus in the aircraft, he asked: \"Are you with us and will you test the rocket in the air? Then, Warsitz, you will be a famous man. And later we will fly to the Moon \u2013 with you at the helm!\"[40]:35\n In June 1937, at Neuhardenberg (a large field about 70\u00a0km (43\u00a0mi) east of Berlin, listed as a reserve airfield in the event of war), one of these latter aircraft was flown with its piston engine shut down during flight by Warsitz, at which time it was propelled by von Braun's rocket power alone. Despite a wheels-up landing and the fuselage having been on fire, it proved to official circles that an aircraft could be flown satisfactorily with a back-thrust system through the rear.[40]:51\n At the same time, Hellmuth Walter's experiments into hydrogen peroxide based rockets were leading towards light and simple rockets that appeared well-suited for aircraft installation. Also the firm of Hellmuth Walter at Kiel had been commissioned by the RLM to build a rocket engine for the He 112, so there were two different new rocket motor designs at Neuhardenberg: whereas von Braun's engines were powered by alcohol and liquid oxygen, Walter engines had hydrogen peroxide and calcium permanganate as a catalyst. Von Braun's engines used direct combustion and created fire, the Walter devices used hot vapors from a chemical reaction, but both created thrust and provided high speed.[40]:41 The subsequent flights with the He-112 used the Walter-rocket instead of von Braun's; it was more reliable, simpler to operate, and safer for the test pilot, Warsitz.[40]:55\n SS General Hans Kammler, who as an engineer had constructed several concentration camps, including Auschwitz, had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as slave laborers in the rocket program. Arthur Rudolph, chief engineer of the V-2 rocket factory at Peenem\u00fcnde, endorsed this idea in April 1943 when a labor shortage developed. More people died building the V-2 rockets than were killed by it as a weapon.[41] Von Braun admitted visiting the plant at Mittelwerk on many occasions,[5] and called conditions at the plant \"repulsive\", but claimed never to have personally witnessed any deaths or beatings, although it had become clear to him by 1944 that deaths had occurred.[42] He denied ever having visited the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp itself, where 20,000 died from illness, beatings, hangings, and intolerable working conditions.[43]\n Some prisoners claim von Braun engaged in brutal treatment or approved of it. Guy Morand, a French resistance fighter who was a prisoner in Dora, testified in 1995 that after an apparent sabotage attempt, von Braun ordered a prisoner to be flogged,[44] while Robert Cazabonne, another French prisoner, claimed von Braun stood by as prisoners were hanged by chains suspended by cranes.[44]:123\u2013124 However, these accounts may have been a case of mistaken identity.[45] Former Buchenwald inmate Adam Cabala claims that von Braun went to the concentration camp to pick slave laborers:\n ... also the German scientists led by Prof. Wernher von Braun were aware of everything daily. As they went along the corridors, they saw the exhaustion of the inmates, their arduous work and their pain. Not one single time did Prof. Wernher von Braun protest against this cruelty during his frequent stays at Dora. Even the aspect of corpses did not touch him: On a small area near the ambulance shed, inmates tortured to death by slave labor and the terror of the overseers were piling up daily. But, Prof. Wernher von Braun passed them so close that he was almost touching the corpses.[46] Von Braun later claimed that he was aware of the treatment of prisoners, but felt helpless to change the situation.[47]\n According to Andr\u00e9 Sellier, a French historian and survivor of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp, Heinrich Himmler had von Braun come to his Feldkommandostelle Hochwald HQ in East Prussia in February 1944.[48] To increase his power-base within the Nazi regime, Himmler was conspiring to use Kammler to gain control of all German armament programs, including the V-2 program at Peenem\u00fcnde.[13]:38\u201340 He therefore recommended that von Braun work more closely with Kammler to solve the problems of the V-2. Von Braun claimed to have replied that the problems were merely technical and he was confident that they would be solved with Dornberger's assistance.\n Von Braun had been under SD surveillance since October 1943. A secret report stated that he and his colleagues Klaus Riedel and Helmut Gr\u00f6ttrup were said to have expressed regret at an engineer's house one evening in early March 1944 that they were not working on a spaceship[5] and that they felt the war was not going well; this was considered a \"defeatist\" attitude. A young female dentist who was an SS spy reported their comments.[13]:38\u201340 Combined with Himmler's false charges that von Braun and his colleagues were communist sympathizers and had attempted to sabotage the V-2 program, and considering that von Braun regularly piloted his government-provided airplane that might allow him to escape to Britain, this led to their arrest by the Gestapo.[13]:38\u201340\n The unsuspecting von Braun was detained on 14 March (or 15 March),[49] 1944, and was taken to a Gestapo cell in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland),[13]:38\u201340 where he was held for two weeks without knowing the charges against him.\n Through Major Hans Georg Klamroth, in charge of the Abwehr for Peenem\u00fcnde, Dornberger obtained von Braun's conditional release and Albert Speer, Reichsminister for Munitions and War Production, persuaded Hitler to reinstate von Braun so that the V-2 program could continue[5][13]:38\u201340[50] or turn into a \"V-4 program\" (the Rheinbote as a short range ballistic rocket) which in their view would be impossible without von Braun's leadership.[51] In his memoirs, Speer states Hitler had finally conceded that von Braun was to be \"protected from all prosecution as long as he is indispensable, difficult though the general consequences arising from the situation.\"[52]\n The Soviet Army was about 160\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi) from Peenem\u00fcnde in early 1945 when von Braun assembled his planning staff and asked them to decide how and to whom they should surrender. Unwilling to go to the Soviets, von Braun and his staff decided to try to surrender to the Americans. Kammler had ordered relocation of his team to central Germany; however, a conflicting order from an army chief ordered them to join the army and fight. Deciding that Kammler's order was their best bet to defect to the Americans, von Braun fabricated documents and transported 500 of his affiliates to the area around Mittelwerk, where they resumed their work in Bleicherode and surrounding towns after the middle of February 1945. For fear of their documents being destroyed by the SS, von Braun ordered the blueprints to be hidden in an abandoned iron mine in the Harz mountain range near Goslar.[53] The US Counterintelligence Corps managed to unveil the location after lengthy interrogations of von Braun, Walter Dornberger, Bernhard Tessmann and Dieter Huzel and recovered 14 tons of V-2 documents by 15 May 1945, from the British Occupation Zone.[20][54]\n While on an official trip in March, von Braun suffered a complicated fracture of his left arm and shoulder in a car accident after his driver fell asleep at the wheel. His injuries were serious, but he insisted that his arm be set in a cast so he could leave the hospital. Due to this neglect of the injury he had to be hospitalized again a month later where his bones had to be rebroken and realigned.[53]\n In early April, as the Allied forces advanced deeper into Germany, Kammler ordered the engineering team, around 450 specialists, to be moved by train into the town of Oberammergau in the Bavarian Alps, where they were closely guarded by the SS with orders to execute the team if they were about to fall into enemy hands. However, von Braun managed to convince SS Major Kummer to order the dispersal of the group into nearby villages so that they would not be an easy target for U.S. bombers.[53] On 29 April 1945, Oberammergau was captured by the Allied forces who seized the majority of the engineering team.\n Von Braun and several members of the engineering team, including Dornberger, made it to Austria.[55] On 2 May 1945, upon finding an American private from the U.S. 44th Infantry Division, von Braun's brother and fellow rocket engineer, Magnus, approached the soldier on a bicycle, calling out in broken English: \"My name is Magnus von Braun. My brother invented the V-2. We want to surrender.\"[10][56] After the surrender, Wernher von Braun spoke to the press:\n We knew that we had created a new means of warfare, and the question as to what nation, to what victorious nation we were willing to entrust this brainchild of ours was a moral decision more than anything else. We wanted to see the world spared another conflict such as Germany had just been through, and we felt that only by surrendering such a weapon to people who are guided not by the laws of materialism but by Christianity and humanity could such an assurance to the world be best secured.[57]\n The American high command was well aware of how important their catch was: von Braun had been at the top of the Black List, the code name for the list of German scientists and engineers targeted for immediate interrogation by U.S. military experts. On 9 June 1945, two days before the originally scheduled handover of the Nordhausen and Bleicherode area in Thuringia to the Soviets, U.S. Army Major Robert B. Staver, Chief of the Jet Propulsion Section of the Research and Intelligence Branch of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in London, and Lt Col R. L. Williams took von Braun and his department chiefs by Jeep from Garmisch to Munich, from where they were flown to Nordhausen. On the following days, a larger group of rocket engineers, among them Helmut Gr\u00f6ttrup, was evacuated from Bleicherode 40 miles (64\u00a0km) southwest to Witzenhausen, a small town in the American Zone.[58] The Red Army eventually took over Thuringia as part of the Soviet occupation zone after 1 July 1945, as agreed by the Yalta Conference.\n Von Braun was briefly detained at the \"Dustbin\" interrogation center at Kransberg Castle, where the elite of the Third Reich's economic, scientific and technological sectors were debriefed by U.S. and British intelligence officials.[59] Initially, he was recruited to the U.S. under a program called Operation Overcast, subsequently known as Operation Paperclip. There is evidence, however, that British intelligence and scientists were the first to interview him in depth, eager to gain information that they knew U.S. officials would deny them. The team included the young L.S. Snell, then the leading British rocket engineer, later chief designer of Rolls-Royce Limited and inventor of the Concorde's engines. The specific information the British gleaned remained top secret, both from the Americans and from the other allies.[citation needed]\n On 20 June 1945, U.S. Secretary of State Edward Stettinius Jr. approved the transfer of von Braun and his specialists to the United States as one of his last acts in office; however, this was not announced to the public until 1 October 1945.[60]\n The first seven technicians arrived in the United States at New Castle Army Air Field, just south of Wilmington, Delaware, on 20 September 1945. They were then flown to Boston and taken by boat to the Army Intelligence Service post at Fort Strong in Boston Harbor. Later, with the exception of von Braun, the men were transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland to sort out the Peenem\u00fcnde documents, enabling the scientists to continue their rocketry experiments.[citation needed]\n Finally, von Braun and his remaining Peenem\u00fcnde staff (see List of German rocket scientists in the United States) were transferred to their new home at Fort Bliss, a large Army installation just north of El Paso. Von Braun would later write he found it hard to develop a \"genuine emotional attachment\" to his new surroundings.[61] His chief design engineer Walther Reidel became the subject of a December 1946 article \"German Scientist Says American Cooking Tasteless; Dislikes Rubberized Chicken\", exposing the presence of von Braun's team in the country and drawing criticism from Albert Einstein and John Dingell.[61] Requests to improve their living conditions such as laying linoleum over their cracked wood flooring were rejected.[61] Von Braun remarked, \"at Peenem\u00fcnde we had been coddled, here you were counting pennies\".[61] Whereas von Braun had thousands of engineers who answered to him at Peenem\u00fcnde, he was now subordinate to \"pimply\" 26-year-old Jim Hamill, an Army major who possessed only an undergraduate degree in engineering.[61] His loyal Germans still addressed him as \"Herr Professor,\" but Hamill addressed him as \"Wernher\" and never responded to von Braun's request for more materials. Every proposal for new rocket ideas was dismissed.[61]\n While at Fort Bliss, they trained military, industrial, and university personnel in the intricacies of rockets and guided missiles. As part of the Hermes project, they helped refurbish, assemble, and launch a number of V-2s that had been shipped from Germany to the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico. They also continued to study the future potential of rockets for military and research applications. Since they were not permitted to leave Fort Bliss without military escort, von Braun and his colleagues began to refer to themselves only half-jokingly as \"PoPs\" \u2013 \"Prisoners of Peace\".[62]\n In 1950, at the start of the Korean War, von Braun and his team were transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, his home for the next 20 years. Between 1952 and 1956,[63] von Braun led the Army's rocket development team at Redstone Arsenal, resulting in the Redstone rocket, which was used for the first live nuclear ballistic missile tests conducted by the United States. He personally witnessed this historic launch and detonation.[64] Work on the Redstone led to development of the first high-precision inertial guidance system on the Redstone rocket.[65]\n As director of the Development Operations Division of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, von Braun, with his team, then developed the Jupiter-C, a modified Redstone rocket.[66] The Jupiter-C successfully launched the West's first satellite, Explorer 1, on 31 January 1958. This event signaled the birth of America's space program.\n Despite the work on the Redstone rocket, the 12 years from 1945 to 1957 were probably some of the most frustrating for von Braun and his colleagues. In the Soviet Union, Sergei Korolev and his team of scientists and engineers plowed ahead with several new rocket designs and the Sputnik program, while the American government was not very interested in von Braun's work or views and embarked only on a very modest rocket-building program. In the meantime, the press tended to dwell on von Braun's past as a member of the SS and the slave labor used to build his V-2 rockets.[citation needed]\n Repeating the pattern he had established during his earlier career in Germany, von Braun \u2013 while directing military rocket development in the real world \u2013 continued to entertain his engineer-scientist's dream of a future in which rockets would be used for space exploration. However, he was no longer at risk of being sacked \u2013 as American public opinion of Germans began to recover, von Braun found himself increasingly in a position to popularize his ideas. The 14 May 1950 headline of The Huntsville Times (\"Dr. von Braun Says Rocket Flights Possible to Moon\") might have marked the beginning of these efforts. Von Braun's ideas rode a publicity wave that was created by science fiction movies and stories.\n In 1952, von Braun first published his concept of a crewed space station in a Collier's Weekly magazine series of articles titled \"Man Will Conquer Space Soon!\". These articles were illustrated by the space artist Chesley Bonestell and were influential in spreading his ideas. Frequently, von Braun worked with fellow German-born space advocate and science writer Willy Ley to publish his concepts, which, unsurprisingly, were heavy on the engineering side and anticipated many technical aspects of space flight that later became reality.\n The space station (to be constructed using rockets with recoverable and reusable ascent stages) would be a toroid structure, with a diameter of 250 feet (76\u00a0m); this built on the concept of a rotating wheel-shaped station introduced in 1929 by Herman Poto\u010dnik in his book The Problem of Space Travel \u2013 The Rocket Motor. The space station would spin around a central docking nave to provide artificial gravity, and would be assembled in a 1,075-mile (1,730\u00a0km) two-hour, high-inclination Earth orbit allowing observation of essentially every point on Earth on at least a daily basis. The ultimate purpose of the space station would be to provide an assembly platform for crewed lunar expeditions. More than a decade later, the movie version of 2001: A Space Odyssey would draw heavily on the design concept in its visualization of an orbital space station.\n Von Braun envisioned these expeditions as very large-scale undertakings, with a total of 50\u00a0astronauts traveling in three huge spacecraft (two for crew, one primarily for cargo), each 49\u00a0m (160.76\u00a0ft) long and 33\u00a0m (108.27\u00a0ft) in diameter and driven by a rectangular array of 30\u00a0rocket propulsion engines.[67] Upon arrival, astronauts would establish a permanent lunar base in the Sinus Roris region by using the emptied cargo holds of their craft as shelters, and would explore their surroundings for eight weeks. This would include a 400\u00a0km (249\u00a0mi) expedition in pressurized rovers to the crater Harpalus and the Mare Imbrium foothills.\n At this time, von Braun also worked out preliminary concepts for a human mission to Mars that used the space station as a staging point. His initial plans, published in The Mars Project (1952), had envisaged a fleet of 10 spacecraft (each with a mass of 3,720 metric tonnes), three of them uncrewed and each carrying one 200-tonne winged lander[67] in addition to cargo, and nine crew vehicles transporting a total of 70\u00a0astronauts. The engineering and astronautical parameters of this gigantic mission were thoroughly calculated. A later project was much more modest, using only one purely orbital cargo ship and one crewed craft. In each case, the expedition would use minimum-energy Hohmann transfer orbits for its trips to Mars and back to Earth.\n Before technically formalizing his thoughts on human spaceflight to Mars, von Braun had written a science fiction novel on the subject, set in the year 1980. However, the manuscript was rejected by no fewer than 18\u00a0publishers.[68] Von Braun later published small portions of this opus in magazines, to illustrate selected aspects of his Mars project popularizations. The complete manuscript, titled Project Mars: A Technical Tale, did not appear as a printed book until December 2006.[69]\n In the hope that its involvement would bring about greater public interest in the future of the space program, von Braun also began working with Walt Disney and the Disney studios as a technical director, initially for three television films about space exploration. The initial broadcast devoted to space exploration was Man in Space, which first went on air on 9 March 1955, drawing 40 million viewers.[61][70][71]\n Later (in 1959) von Braun published a short booklet, condensed from episodes that had appeared in This Week Magazine before\u2014describing his updated concept of the first crewed lunar landing.[72] The scenario included only a single and relatively small spacecraft\u2014a winged lander with a crew of only two experienced pilots who had already circumnavigated the Moon on an earlier mission. The brute-force direct ascent flight schedule used a rocket design with five sequential stages, loosely based on the Nova designs that were under discussion at this time. After a night launch from a Pacific island, the first three stages would bring the spacecraft (with the two remaining upper stages attached) to terrestrial escape velocity, with each burn creating an acceleration of 8\u20139 times standard gravity. Residual propellant in the third stage would be used for the deceleration intended to commence only a few hundred kilometers above the landing site in a crater near the lunar north pole. The fourth stage provided acceleration to lunar escape velocity, while the fifth stage would be responsible for a deceleration during return to the Earth to a residual speed that allows aerocapture of the spacecraft ending in a runway landing, much in the way of the Space Shuttle. One remarkable feature of this technical tale is that the engineer von Braun anticipated a medical phenomenon that would become apparent only years later: being a veteran astronaut with no history of serious adverse reactions to weightlessness offers no protection against becoming unexpectedly and violently spacesick.\n[check quotation syntax]\n In the first half of his life, von Braun was a nonpracticing, \"perfunctory\" Lutheran, whose affiliation was nominal and not taken seriously.[73] As described by Ernst Stuhlinger and Frederick I. Ordway III: \"Throughout his younger years, von Braun did not show signs of religious devotion, or even an interest in things related to the church or to biblical teachings. In fact, he was known to his friends as a 'merry heathen' (fr\u00f6hlicher Heide).\"[74] Nevertheless, in 1945 he explained his decision to surrender to the Western Allies, rather than Russians, as being influenced by a desire to share rocket technology with people who followed the Bible. In 1946,[75]:469 he attended church in El Paso, Texas, and underwent a religious conversion to evangelical Christianity.[76] In an unnamed religious magazine he stated:\n One day in Fort Bliss, a neighbor called and asked if I would like to go to church with him. I accepted, because I wanted to see if the American church was just a country club as I'd been led to expect. Instead, I found a small, white frame building ... in the hot Texas sun on a browned-grass lot ... Together, these people make a live, vibrant community. This was the first time I really understood that religion was not a cathedral inherited from the past, or a quick prayer at the last minute. To be effective, a religion has to be backed up by discipline and effort. On the motives behind this conversion, Michael J. Neufeld is of the opinion that he turned to religion \"to pacify his own conscience\",[77] whereas University of Southampton scholar Kendrick Oliver said that von Braun was presumably moved \"by a desire to find a new direction for his life after the moral chaos of his service for the Third Reich\".[78] Having \"concluded one bad bargain with the Devil, perhaps now he felt a need to have God securely at his side\".[79]\n Later in life, he joined an Episcopal congregation,[76] and became increasingly religious.[80] He publicly spoke and wrote about the complementarity of science and religion, the afterlife of the soul, and his belief in God.[81][82] He stated, \"Through science man strives to learn more of the mysteries of creation. Through religion he seeks to know the Creator.\"[83] He was interviewed by the Assemblies of God pastor C. M. Ward, as stating, \"The farther we probe into space, the greater my faith.\"[84] In addition, he met privately with evangelist Billy Graham and with the pacifist leader Martin Luther King Jr. [85]\n Von Braun developed and published his space station concept during the time of the Cold War when the U.S. government put the containment of the Soviet Union above everything else. The fact that his space station \u2013 if armed with missiles that could be easily adapted from those already available at this time \u2013 would give the United States space superiority in both orbital and orbit-to-ground warfare did not escape him. In his popular writings, von Braun elaborated on them in several of his books and articles, but he took care to qualify such military applications as \"particularly dreadful\". This much-less-peaceful aspect of von Braun's \"drive for space\" has been reviewed by Michael J. Neufeld from the Space History Division of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.[86]\n The U.S. Navy had been tasked with building a rocket to lift satellites into orbit, but the resulting Vanguard rocket launch system was unreliable. In 1957, with the launch of Sputnik 1, a growing belief within the United States existed that it was lagging behind the Soviet Union in the emerging Space Race. American authorities then chose to use von Braun and his German team's experience with missiles to create an orbital launch vehicle. Von Braun had originally proposed such an idea in 1954, but it was denied at the time.[61]\n NASA was established by law on 29 July 1958. One day later, the 50th Redstone rocket was successfully launched from Johnston Atoll in the south Pacific as part of Operation Hardtack I. Two years later, NASA opened the Marshall Space Flight Center at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, and the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) development team led by von Braun was transferred to NASA. In a face-to-face meeting with Herb York at the Pentagon, von Braun made it clear he would go to NASA only if development of the Saturn were allowed to continue.[87] Von Braun became the center's first director on 1 July 1960 and held the position until 27 January 1970.[88]\n Von Braun's early years at NASA included a failed \"four-inch flight\" during which the first uncrewed Mercury-Redstone rocket only rose a few inches before settling back onto the launch pad. The launch failure was later determined to be the result of a \"power plug with one prong shorter than the other because a worker filed it to make it fit\". Because of the difference in the length of one prong, the launch system detected the difference in the power disconnection as a \"cut-off signal to the engine\". The system stopped the launch, and the incident created a \"nadir of morale in Project Mercury\".[89]\n After the flight of Mercury-Redstone 2 in January 1961 experienced a string of problems, von Braun insisted on one more test before the Redstone could be deemed man-rated. His overly cautious nature brought about clashes with other people involved in the program, who argued that MR-2's technical issues were simple and had been resolved shortly after the flight. He overruled them, so a test mission involving a Redstone on a boilerplate capsule was flown successfully in March. Von Braun's stubbornness was blamed for the inability of the U.S. to launch a crewed space mission before the Soviet Union, which ended up putting the first man in space the following month.[90] Three weeks later on 5 May, von Braun's team successfully launched Alan Shepard into space. He named his Mercury-Redstone 3 Freedom 7[91]\n The Marshall Center's first major program was the development of Saturn rockets to carry heavy payloads into and beyond Earth orbit. From this, the Apollo program for crewed Moon flights was developed. Von Braun initially pushed for a flight engineering concept that called for an Earth orbit rendezvous technique (the approach he had argued for building his space station), but in 1962, he converted to the lunar orbit rendezvous concept that was subsequently realized.[92][93] During Apollo, he worked closely with former Peenem\u00fcnde teammate, Kurt H. Debus, the first director of the Kennedy Space Center. His dream to help mankind set foot on the Moon became a reality on 16 July 1969, when a Marshall-developed Saturn V rocket launched the crew of Apollo 11 on its historic eight-day mission. Over the course of the program, Saturn V rockets enabled six teams of astronauts to reach the surface of the Moon.\n During the late 1960s, von Braun was instrumental in the development of the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville. The desk from which he guided America's entry in the space race remains on display there. He also was instrumental in the launching of the experimental Applications Technology Satellite. He traveled to India and hoped that the program would be helpful for bringing a massive educational television project to help the poorest people in that country.[94]\n During the local summer of 1966\u201367, von Braun participated in a field trip to Antarctica, organized for him and several other members of top NASA management.[95] The goal of the field trip was to determine whether the experience gained by U.S. scientific and technological community during the exploration of Antarctic wastelands would be useful for the crewed exploration of space. Von Braun was mainly interested in management of the scientific effort on Antarctic research stations, logistics, habitation, and life support, and in using the barren Antarctic terrain like the glacial dry valleys to test the equipment that one day would be used to look for signs of life on Mars and other worlds.[96]\n In an internal memo dated 16 January 1969,[97] von Braun had confirmed to his staff that he would stay on as a center director at Huntsville to head the Apollo Applications Program. He referred to this time as a moment in his life when he felt the strong need to pray, stating \"I certainly prayed a lot before and during the crucial Apollo flights\".[98] A few months later, on occasion of the first Moon landing, he publicly expressed his optimism that the Saturn V carrier system would continue to be developed, advocating human missions to Mars in the 1980s.[99]\n Nonetheless, on 1 March 1970, von Braun and his family relocated to Washington, DC, when he was assigned the post of NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning at NASA Headquarters. After a series of conflicts associated with the truncation of the Apollo program, and facing severe budget constraints, von Braun retired from NASA on 26 May 1972. Not only had it become evident by this time that NASA and his visions for future U.S. space flight projects were incompatible, but also it was perhaps even more frustrating for him to see popular support for a continued presence of man in space wane dramatically once the goal to reach the Moon had been accomplished.\n Von Braun also developed the idea of a Space Camp that would train children in fields of science and space technologies, as well as help their mental development much the same way sports camps aim at improving physical development.[20]:354\u2013355[100]\n After leaving NASA, von Braun became Vice President for Engineering and Development at the aerospace company Fairchild Industries in Germantown, Maryland, on 1 July 1972.[100]\n In 1973, during a routine physical examination, von Braun was diagnosed with kidney cancer, which could not be controlled with the medical techniques available at the time.[101] Von Braun continued his work to the extent possible, which included accepting invitations to speak at colleges and universities, as he was eager to cultivate interest in human spaceflight and rocketry, particularly his desire to encourage the next generation of aerospace engineers.\n Von Braun helped establish and promote the National Space Institute, a precursor of the present-day National Space Society, in 1975, and became its first president and chairman. In 1976, he became scientific consultant to Lutz Kayser, the CEO of OTRAG, and a member of the Daimler-Benz board of directors. However, his deteriorating health forced him to retire from Fairchild on 31 December 1976. When the 1975 National Medal of Science was awarded to him in early 1977, he was hospitalized, and unable to attend the White House ceremony.\n Von Braun's insistence on further tests after Mercury-Redstone 2 flew higher than planned has been identified as contributing to the Soviet Union's success in launching the first human in space.[102] The Mercury-Redstone BD flight was successful, but took up the launch slot that could have put Alan Shepard into space three weeks ahead of Yuri Gagarin. His Soviet counterpart Sergei Korolev insisted on two successful flights with dogs before risking Gagarin's life on a crewed attempt. The second test flight took place one day after the Mercury-Redstone BD mission.[20]\n Von Braun took a very conservative approach to engineering, designing with ample safety factors and redundant structure. This became a point of contention with other engineers, who struggled to keep vehicle weight down so that payload could be maximized. As noted above, his excessive caution likely led to the U.S. losing the race to put a man into space with the Soviets. Krafft Ehricke likened von Braun's approach to building the Brooklyn Bridge.[103]:208 Many at NASA headquarters jokingly referred to Marshall as the \"Chicago Bridge and Iron Works\", but acknowledged that the designs worked.[104] The conservative approach paid off when a fifth engine was added to the Saturn C-4, producing the Saturn V. The C-4 design had a large crossbeam that could easily absorb the thrust of an additional engine.[20]:371\n Von Braun had a charismatic personality and was known as a ladies' man. As a student in Berlin, he would often be seen in the evenings in the company of two girlfriends at once.[20]:63 He later had a succession of affairs within the secretarial and computer pool at Peenem\u00fcnde.[20]:92\u201394\n According to a 2015 book The Hidden World Part 2, von Braun had a secret relationship with another test pilot and ardent Nazi, Hanna Reitsch, and in 1932 the pair had a child, Alicia Webber. She also had a relationship with the already married, German-born Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, who in turn fathered Webber's daughter, Alicia von Bielefeld (born (1952-02-21)21 February 1952).[105]\n In January 1943, von Braun became engaged to Dorothee Brill, a physical education teacher in Berlin, and he sought permission to marry from the SS Race and Settlement Office. However, the engagement was broken due to his mother's opposition.[20]:146\u2013147 Later in 1943 he had an affair with a French woman while in Paris preparing V-2 launch sites in northeastern France. She was imprisoned for collaboration after the war and became destitute.[20]:147\u2013148\n During his stay at Fort Bliss, von Braun proposed marriage to Maria Luise von Quistorp (born (1928-06-10)10 June 1928), his maternal first cousin, in a letter to his father. He married her in a Lutheran church in Landshut, Bavaria on 1 March 1947, having received permission to go back to Germany and return with his bride. He was 35 and his new bride was 18.[106] Shortly after, he became an evangelical Christian. He returned to New York on 26 March 1947, with his wife, father, and mother. On 8 December 1948, the von Brauns' first daughter together Iris Careen was born at Fort Bliss Army Hospital.[29] The couple had two more children: Margrit C\u00e9cile, born 8 May 1952,[107] and Peter Constantine, born 2 June 1960.[107]\n On 15 April 1955, von Braun became a naturalized citizen of the United States.\n In 1973, von Braun was diagnosed with kidney cancer during a routine medical examination. However, he continued to work unrestrained for a number of years. In January 1977, now very ill, he resigned from Fairchild Industries. Later in 1977, President Gerald Ford awarded him the country's highest science honor, the National Medal of Science in Engineering. He was, however, too ill to attend the White House ceremony.[108]\n Von Braun died on 16 June 1977 of pancreatic cancer in Alexandria, Virginia at age 65.[109][110] He is buried at the Ivy Hill Cemetery. His gravestone cites Psalm 19:1: \"The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork\" (KJV).[111]\n (left SS after graduation from the school; commissioned in 1940 with date of entry backdated to 1934)\n \n \n Film and television\nVon Braun has been featured in a number of films and television shows or series:\n Several fictional characters have been modeled on von Braun:\n In print media:\n In literature:\n In theatre:\n In music:\n ", "tags": ["Wernher von Braun", "1912 births", "1977 deaths", "20th-century German physicists", "20th-century American physicists", "20th-century American engineers", "20th-century American architects", "20th-century American writers", "German aerospace engineers", "American aerospace engineers", "20th-century German architects", "German inventors", "American technology writers", "Apollo program", "Barons of Germany", "Nazi Party members", "Burials at Ivy Hill Cemetery (Alexandria, Virginia)", "Converts to Evangelicalism from Lutheranism", "Deaths from cancer in Virginia", "Deaths from pancreatic cancer", "Directors of the Marshall Space Flight Center", "Early spaceflight scientists", "ETH Zurich alumni", "Franz\u00f6sisches Gymnasium Berlin alumni", "German emigrants to the United States", "German rocket scientists", "Humboldt University of Berlin alumni", "Knights Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "NASA people", "National Medal of Science laureates", "Operation Paperclip", "Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center and Airfield", "People from Huntsville, Alabama", "People from the Province of Posen", "People from Wyrzysk", "People with acquired American citizenship", "Architects in the Nazi Party", "Recipients of the Knights Cross of the War Merit Cross", "Recipients of the NASA Distinguished Service Medal", "Research and development in Nazi Germany", "Space advocates", "SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer", "Technical University of Berlin alumni", "Werner von Siemens Ring laureates", "V-weapons people", "Recipients of the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with failed verification", "Articles with failed verification from May 2020", "Harv and Sfn no-target errors", "CS1: long volume value", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from January 2019", "Use American English from April 2018", "All Wikipedia articles written in American English", "Pages using infobox military person with embed", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2021", "Articles with unsourced statements from January 2015", "Articles with unsourced statements from July 2019", "All articles that may contain original research", "Articles that may contain original research from March 2021", "Articles with unsourced statements from December 2014", "Articles with unsourced statements from April 2013", "Articles needing additional references from January 2018", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles needing additional references from April 2017", "Commons link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "\"Werner Braun\" redirects here.

He was the leading figure in the development of rocket technology in Nazi Germany and a pioneer of rocket and space technology in the United States.[4]\nWhile in his twenties and early thirties, von Braun worked in Nazi Germany's rocket development program. He helped design and co-developed the V-2 rocket at Peenem\u00fcnde during World War II. Following the war he was secretly moved to the United States, along with about 1,600 other German scientists, engineers, and technicians, as part of Operation Paperclip.[5] He worked for the United States Army on an intermediate-range ballistic missile program, and he developed the rockets that launched the United States' first space satellite Explorer 1.\nIn 1960, his group was assimilated into NASA, where he served as director of the newly formed Marshall Space Flight Center and as the chief architect of the Saturn V super heavy-lift launch vehicle that propelled the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon.[6][7] In 1967, von Braun was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering, and in 1975, he received the National Medal of Science. He advocated for a human mission to Mars.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career in Germany\n\n2.1 Involvement with the Nazi regime\n\n2.1.1 Nazi Party membership\n2.1.2 Membership in the Allgemeine-SS\n\n\n2.2 Work under Nazi regime\n2.3 Experiments with rocket aircraft\n2.4 Slave labor\n2.5 Arrest and release by the Nazi regime\n2.6 Surrender to the Americans\n\n\n3 American career\n\n3.1 U.S. Army career\n3.2 Popular concepts for a human presence in space\n3.3 Religious conversion\n3.4 Concepts for orbital warfare\n3.5 NASA career\n3.6 Career after NASA\n\n\n4 Engineering philosophy\n5 Personal life\n6 Death\n7 Recognition and critique\n8 Summary of SS career\n\n8.1 Dates of rank\n\n\n9 Honors\n10 In popular culture\n11 Published works\n12 See also\n13 References\n14 Further reading\n15 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nWernher von Braun was born on 23 March 1912, in the small town of Wirsitz in the Posen Province, then the German Empire. He was the second of three sons of a noble Lutheran family. From birth he held the title of Freiherr (equivalent to Baron). The German nobility's legal privileges were abolished in 1919, although noble titles could still be used as part of the family name.[citation needed]\nHis father, Magnus Freiherr von Braun (1878\u20131972), was a civil servant and conservative politician; he served as Minister of Agriculture in the federal government during the Weimar Republic. His mother, Emmy von Quistorp (1886\u20131959), traced her ancestry through both parents to medieval European royalty and was a descendant of Philip III of France, Valdemar I of Denmark, Robert III of Scotland, and Edward III of England.[8][9] Wernher had an older brother, the West German diplomat Sigismund von Braun, who served as Secretary of State in the Foreign Office in the 1970s, and a younger brother, also named Magnus von Braun, who was a rocket scientist and later a senior executive with Chrysler.[10]\nThe family moved to Berlin in 1915, where his father worked at the Ministry of the Interior. After Wernher's Confirmation, his mother gave him a telescope, and he developed a passion for astronomy.[11] Here in 1924, the 12-year-old Wernher, inspired by speed records established by Max Valier and Fritz von Opel in rocket-propelled cars,[12] caused a major disruption in a crowded street by detonating a toy wagon to which he had attached fireworks. He was taken into custody by the local police until his father came to get him.\nWernher learned to play both the cello and the piano at an early age and at one time wanted to become a composer. He took lessons from the composer Paul Hindemith. The few pieces of Wernher's youthful compositions that exist are reminiscent of Hindemith's style.[13]:11 He could play piano pieces of Beethoven and Bach from memory.\nBeginning in 1925, Wernher attended a boarding school at Ettersburg Castle near Weimar, where he did not do well in physics and mathematics. There he acquired a copy of Die Rakete zu den Planetenr\u00e4umen (1923, By Rocket into Planetary Space)[14] by rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth. In 1928, his parents moved him to the Hermann-Lietz-Internat (also a residential school) on the East Frisian North Sea island of Spiekeroog. Space travel had always fascinated Wernher, and from then on he applied himself to physics and mathematics to pursue his interest in rocket engineering.\nIn 1930, von Braun attended the Technische Hochschule Berlin, where he joined the Spaceflight Society (Verein f\u00fcr Raumschiffahrt or \"VfR\") and assisted Willy Ley in his liquid-fueled rocket motor tests in conjunction with Hermann Oberth.[15] In spring 1932, he graduated with a diploma in mechanical engineering.[16] His early exposure to rocketry convinced him that the exploration of space would require far more than applications of the current engineering technology. Wanting to learn more about physics, chemistry, and astronomy, von Braun entered the Friedrich-Wilhelm University of Berlin for doctoral studies and graduated with a doctorate in physics in 1934.[12] He also studied at ETH Z\u00fcrich for a term from June to October 1931.[12] Although he worked mainly on military rockets in his later years there, space travel remained his primary interest.\nIn 1930, von Braun attended a presentation given by Auguste Piccard. After the talk, the young student approached the famous pioneer of high-altitude balloon flight, and stated to him: \"You know, I plan on traveling to the Moon at some time.\" Piccard is said to have responded with encouraging words.[17]\nVon Braun was greatly influenced by Oberth, of whom he said:\n\nHermann Oberth was the first who, when thinking about the possibility of spaceships, grabbed a slide-rule and presented mathematically analyzed concepts and designs ... I, myself, owe to him not only the guiding-star of my life, but also my first contact with the theoretical and practical aspects of rocketry and space travel. A place of honor should be reserved in the history of science and technology for his ground-breaking contributions in the field of astronautics.[18]\nCareer in Germany[edit]\nAccording to historian Norman Davies, von Braun was able to pursue a career as a rocket scientist in Germany due to a \"curious oversight\" in the Treaty of Versailles which did not include rocketry in its list of weapons forbidden to Germany.[19]\n\nInvolvement with the Nazi regime[edit]\n Von Braun with Fritz Todt, who utilized forced labor for major works across occupied Europe. Von Braun is wearing the Nazi party badge on his suit lapel.\nNazi Party membership[edit]\nVon Braun had an ambivalent and complex relationship with the Nazi Third Reich.[5] He applied for membership of the Nazi Party on 12 November 1937, and was issued membership number 5,738,692.[20]:96\nMichael J. Neufeld, an author of aerospace history and chief of the Space History Division at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, wrote that ten years after von Braun obtained his Nazi Party membership, he signed an affidavit for the U.S. Army misrepresenting the year of his membership, saying incorrectly:[20]:96\n\nIn 1939, I was officially demanded to join the National Socialist Party. At this time I was already Technical Director at the Army Rocket Center at Peenem\u00fcnde (Baltic Sea). The technical work carried out there had, in the meantime, attracted more and more attention in higher levels. Thus, my refusal to join the party would have meant that I would have to abandon the work of my life. Therefore, I decided to join. My membership in the party did not involve any political activity.\nIt has not been ascertained whether von Braun's error with regard to the year was deliberate or a simple mistake.[20]:96 Neufeld further wrote:\n\nVon Braun, like other Peenem\u00fcnders, was assigned to the local group in Karlshagen; there is no evidence that he did more than send in his monthly dues. But he is seen in some photographs with the party's swastika pin in his lapel \u2013 it was politically useful to demonstrate his membership.[20]:96\nVon Braun's later attitude toward the National Socialist regime of the late 1930s and early 1940s was complex. He said that he had been so influenced by the early Nazi promise of release from the post\u2013World War I economic effects, that his patriotic feelings had increased.[citation needed] In a 1952 memoir article he admitted that, at that time, he \"fared relatively rather well under totalitarianism\".[20]:96\u201397 Yet, he also wrote that \"to us, Hitler was still only a pompous fool with a Charlie Chaplin moustache\"[21] and that he perceived him as \"another Napoleon\" who was \"wholly without scruples, a godless man who thought himself the only god\".[22]\n\nMembership in the Allgemeine-SS[edit]\nVon Braun joined the SS horseback riding school on 1 November 1933 as an SS-Anw\u00e4rter. He left the following year.[citation needed]:63 In 1940, he joined the SS[23]:47[24] and was given the rank of Untersturmf\u00fchrer in the Allgemeine-SS and issued membership number 185,068.[citation needed]:121 In 1947, he gave the U.S. War Department this explanation:\n\nIn spring 1940, one SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer (SS-Colonel) M\u00fcller from Greifswald, a bigger town in the vicinity of Peenem\u00fcnde, looked me up in my office ... and told me that Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Himmler had sent him with the order to urge me to join the SS. I told him I was so busy with my rocket work that I had no time to spare for any political activity. He then told me, that ... the SS would cost me no time at all. I would be awarded the rank of a[n] \"Untersturmfuehrer\" (lieutenant) and it were  [sic] a very definite desire of Himmler that I attend his invitation to join.\nI asked M\u00fcller to give me some time for reflection. He agreed.\n\nRealizing that the matter was of highly political significance for the relation between the SS and the Army, I called immediately on my military superior, Dr. Dornberger. He informed me that the SS had for a long time been trying to get their \"finger in the pie\" of the rocket work. I asked him what to do. He replied on the spot that if I wanted to continue our mutual work, I had no alternative but to join.\nWhen shown a picture of himself standing behind Himmler, von Braun claimed to have worn the SS uniform only that one time,[25] but in 2002 a former SS officer at Peenem\u00fcnde told the BBC that von Braun had regularly worn the SS uniform to official meetings. He began as an Untersturmf\u00fchrer (Second lieutenant) and was promoted three times by Himmler, the last time in June 1943 to SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer (Major). Von Braun later claimed that these were simply technical promotions received each year regularly by mail.[26]\n\nWork under Nazi regime[edit]\n First rank, from left to right, General Dr Walter Dornberger (partially hidden), General Friedrich Olbricht (with Knight's Cross), Major Heinz Brandt, and Wernher von Braun (in civilian dress) at Peenem\u00fcnde, in March 1941.\nIn 1933, von Braun was working on his creative doctorate when the Nazi Party came to power in a coalition government in Germany; rocketry was almost immediately moved onto the national agenda. An artillery captain, Walter Dornberger, arranged an Ordnance Department research grant for von Braun, who then worked next to Dornberger's existing solid-fuel rocket test site at Kummersdorf.\nVon Braun was awarded a doctorate in physics[27] (aerospace engineering) on 27 July 1934, from the University of Berlin for a thesis entitled \"About Combustion Tests\"; his doctoral supervisor was Erich Schumann.[20]:61 However, this thesis was only the public part of von Braun's work. His actual full thesis, Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket (dated 16 April 1934) was kept classified by the German army, and was not published until 1960.[28] By the end of 1934, his group had successfully launched two liquid fuel rockets that rose to heights of 2.2 and 3.5\u00a0km (2\u00a0mi).\nAt the time, Germany was highly interested in American physicist Robert H. Goddard's research. Before 1939, German scientists occasionally contacted Goddard directly with technical questions. Von Braun used Goddard's plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the Aggregat (A) series of rockets. The first successful launch of an A-4 took place on 3 October 1942.[29] The A-4 rocket would become well known as the V-2.[30] In 1963, von Braun reflected on the history of rocketry, and said of Goddard's work: \"His rockets\u00a0... may have been rather crude by present-day standards, but they blazed the trail and incorporated many features used in our most modern rockets and space vehicles.\"[12]\nGoddard confirmed his work was used by von Braun in 1944, shortly before the Nazis began firing V-2s at England. A V-2 crashed in Sweden and some parts were sent to an Annapolis lab where Goddard was doing research for the Navy. If this was the so-called B\u00e4ckebo Bomb, it had been procured by the British in exchange for Spitfires; Annapolis would have received some parts from them. Goddard is reported to have recognized components he had invented, and inferred that his brainchild had been turned into a weapon.[31] Later, von Braun would comment: \"I have very deep and sincere regret for the victims of the V-2 rockets, but there were victims on both sides ... A war is a war, and when my country is at war, my duty is to help win that war.\"[32]\nIn response to Goddard's claims, von Braun said \"at no time in Germany did I or any of my associates ever see a Goddard patent\". This was independently confirmed.[33] He wrote that claims about his lifting Goddard's work were the furthest from the truth, noting that Goddard's paper \"A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes\", which was studied by von Braun and Oberth, lacked the specificity of liquid-fuel experimentation with rockets.[33] It was also confirmed that he was responsible for an estimated 20 patentable innovations related to rocketry, as well as receiving U.S. patents after the war concerning the advancement of rocketry.[33] Documented accounts also stated he provided solutions to a host of aerospace engineering problems in the 1950s and 60s.[33]\nThere were no German rocket societies after the collapse of the VfR, and civilian rocket tests were forbidden by the new Nazi regime. Only military development was allowed, and to this end, a larger facility was erected at the village of Peenem\u00fcnde in northern Germany on the Baltic Sea. Dornberger became the military commander at Peenem\u00fcnde, with von Braun as technical director. In collaboration with the Luftwaffe, the Peenem\u00fcnde group developed liquid-fuel rocket engines for aircraft and jet-assisted takeoffs. They also developed the long-range A-4 ballistic missile and the supersonic Wasserfall anti-aircraft missile.\n\n Schematic of the A4/V2\nOn 22 December 1942, Adolf Hitler ordered the production of the A-4 as a \"vengeance weapon\", and the Peenem\u00fcnde group developed it to target London. Following von Braun's 7 July 1943 presentation of a color movie showing an A-4 taking off, Hitler was so enthusiastic that he personally made von Braun a professor shortly thereafter.[34] In Germany at this time, this was an exceptional promotion for an engineer who was only 31 years old.[original research?]\nBy that time, the British and Soviet intelligence agencies were aware of the rocket program and von Braun's team at Peenem\u00fcnde, based on the intelligence provided by the Polish underground Home Army. Over the nights of 17-18 August 1943, RAF Bomber Command's Operation Hydra dispatched raids on the Peenem\u00fcnde camp consisting of 596 aircraft, and dropped 1,800 tons of explosives.[35] The facility was salvaged and most of the engineering team remained unharmed; however, the raids killed von Braun's engine designer Walter Thiel and Chief Engineer Walther, and the rocket program was delayed.[36][37]\n\nSee also: Bombing of Peenem\u00fcnde in World War II\nThe first combat A-4, renamed the V-2 (Vergeltungswaffe 2 \"Retaliation/Vengeance Weapon 2\") for propaganda purposes, was launched toward England on 7 September 1944, only 21 months after the project had been officially commissioned. Von Braun's interest in rockets was specifically for the application of space travel, not for killing people.[38] Satirist Mort Sahl has been credited with mocking von Braun by saying \"I aim at the stars, but sometimes I hit London.\"[39] That line appears in the film I Aim at the Stars, a 1960 biographical film of von Braun.\n\nExperiments with rocket aircraft[edit]\nDuring 1936, von Braun's rocketry team working at Kummersdorf investigated installing liquid-fuelled rockets in aircraft. Ernst Heinkel enthusiastically supported their efforts, supplying a He-72 and later two He-112s for the experiments. Later in 1936, Erich Warsitz was seconded by the RLM to von Braun and Heinkel, because he had been recognized as one of the most experienced test pilots of the time, and because he also had an extraordinary fund of technical knowledge.[40]:30 After he familiarized Warsitz with a test-stand run, showing him the corresponding apparatus in the aircraft, he asked: \"Are you with us and will you test the rocket in the air? Then, Warsitz, you will be a famous man. And later we will fly to the Moon \u2013 with you at the helm!\"[40]:35\n\n A regular He 112\nIn June 1937, at Neuhardenberg (a large field about 70\u00a0km (43\u00a0mi) east of Berlin, listed as a reserve airfield in the event of war), one of these latter aircraft was flown with its piston engine shut down during flight by Warsitz, at which time it was propelled by von Braun's rocket power alone. Despite a wheels-up landing and the fuselage having been on fire, it proved to official circles that an aircraft could be flown satisfactorily with a back-thrust system through the rear.[40]:51\nAt the same time, Hellmuth Walter's experiments into hydrogen peroxide based rockets were leading towards light and simple rockets that appeared well-suited for aircraft installation. Also the firm of Hellmuth Walter at Kiel had been commissioned by the RLM to build a rocket engine for the He 112, so there were two different new rocket motor designs at Neuhardenberg: whereas von Braun's engines were powered by alcohol and liquid oxygen, Walter engines had hydrogen peroxide and calcium permanganate as a catalyst. Von Braun's engines used direct combustion and created fire, the Walter devices used hot vapors from a chemical reaction, but both created thrust and provided high speed.[40]:41 The subsequent flights with the He-112 used the Walter-rocket instead of von Braun's; it was more reliable, simpler to operate, and safer for the test pilot, Warsitz.[40]:55\n\nSlave labor[edit]\nSS General Hans Kammler, who as an engineer had constructed several concentration camps, including Auschwitz, had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as slave laborers in the rocket program. Arthur Rudolph, chief engineer of the V-2 rocket factory at Peenem\u00fcnde, endorsed this idea in April 1943 when a labor shortage developed. More people died building the V-2 rockets than were killed by it as a weapon.[41] Von Braun admitted visiting the plant at Mittelwerk on many occasions,[5] and called conditions at the plant \"repulsive\", but claimed never to have personally witnessed any deaths or beatings, although it had become clear to him by 1944 that deaths had occurred.[42] He denied ever having visited the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp itself, where 20,000 died from illness, beatings, hangings, and intolerable working conditions.[43]\nSome prisoners claim von Braun engaged in brutal treatment or approved of it. Guy Morand, a French resistance fighter who was a prisoner in Dora, testified in 1995 that after an apparent sabotage attempt, von Braun ordered a prisoner to be flogged,[44] while Robert Cazabonne, another French prisoner, claimed von Braun stood by as prisoners were hanged by chains suspended by cranes.[44]:123\u2013124 However, these accounts may have been a case of mistaken identity.[45] Former Buchenwald inmate Adam Cabala claims that von Braun went to the concentration camp to pick slave laborers:\n\n... also the German scientists led by Prof. Wernher von Braun were aware of everything daily. As they went along the corridors, they saw the exhaustion of the inmates, their arduous work and their pain. Not one single time did Prof. Wernher von Braun protest against this cruelty during his frequent stays at Dora. Even the aspect of corpses did not touch him: On a small area near the ambulance shed, inmates tortured to death by slave labor and the terror of the overseers were piling up daily. But, Prof. Wernher von Braun passed them so close that he was almost touching the corpses.[46]\nVon Braun later claimed that he was aware of the treatment of prisoners, but felt helpless to change the situation.[47]\n\nArrest and release by the Nazi regime[edit]\nAccording to Andr\u00e9 Sellier, a French historian and survivor of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp, Heinrich Himmler had von Braun come to his Feldkommandostelle Hochwald HQ in East Prussia in February 1944.[48] To increase his power-base within the Nazi regime, Himmler was conspiring to use Kammler to gain control of all German armament programs, including the V-2 program at Peenem\u00fcnde.[13]:38\u201340 He therefore recommended that von Braun work more closely with Kammler to solve the problems of the V-2. Von Braun claimed to have replied that the problems were merely technical and he was confident that they would be solved with Dornberger's assistance.\nVon Braun had been under SD surveillance since October 1943. A secret report stated that he and his colleagues Klaus Riedel and Helmut Gr\u00f6ttrup were said to have expressed regret at an engineer's house one evening in early March 1944 that they were not working on a spaceship[5] and that they felt the war was not going well; this was considered a \"defeatist\" attitude. A young female dentist who was an SS spy reported their comments.[13]:38\u201340 Combined with Himmler's false charges that von Braun and his colleagues were communist sympathizers and had attempted to sabotage the V-2 program, and considering that von Braun regularly piloted his government-provided airplane that might allow him to escape to Britain, this led to their arrest by the Gestapo.[13]:38\u201340\nThe unsuspecting von Braun was detained on 14 March (or 15 March),[49] 1944, and was taken to a Gestapo cell in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland),[13]:38\u201340 where he was held for two weeks without knowing the charges against him.\nThrough Major Hans Georg Klamroth, in charge of the Abwehr for Peenem\u00fcnde, Dornberger obtained von Braun's conditional release and Albert Speer, Reichsminister for Munitions and War Production, persuaded Hitler to reinstate von Braun so that the V-2 program could continue[5][13]:38\u201340[50] or turn into a \"V-4 program\" (the Rheinbote as a short range ballistic rocket) which in their view would be impossible without von Braun's leadership.[51] In his memoirs, Speer states Hitler had finally conceded that von Braun was to be \"protected from all prosecution as long as he is indispensable, difficult though the general consequences arising from the situation.\"[52]\n\nSurrender to the Americans[edit]\n Von Braun, with his arm in a cast, Walter Dornberger (on the left) and Bernhard Tessmann (on the right) surrendered to the Americans just before this May 3, 1945 photo.\nThe Soviet Army was about 160\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi) from Peenem\u00fcnde in early 1945 when von Braun assembled his planning staff and asked them to decide how and to whom they should surrender. Unwilling to go to the Soviets, von Braun and his staff decided to try to surrender to the Americans. Kammler had ordered relocation of his team to central Germany; however, a conflicting order from an army chief ordered them to join the army and fight. Deciding that Kammler's order was their best bet to defect to the Americans, von Braun fabricated documents and transported 500 of his affiliates to the area around Mittelwerk, where they resumed their work in Bleicherode and surrounding towns after the middle of February 1945. For fear of their documents being destroyed by the SS, von Braun ordered the blueprints to be hidden in an abandoned iron mine in the Harz mountain range near Goslar.[53] The US Counterintelligence Corps managed to unveil the location after lengthy interrogations of von Braun, Walter Dornberger, Bernhard Tessmann and Dieter Huzel and recovered 14 tons of V-2 documents by 15 May 1945, from the British Occupation Zone.[20][54]\nWhile on an official trip in March, von Braun suffered a complicated fracture of his left arm and shoulder in a car accident after his driver fell asleep at the wheel. His injuries were serious, but he insisted that his arm be set in a cast so he could leave the hospital. Due to this neglect of the injury he had to be hospitalized again a month later where his bones had to be rebroken and realigned.[53]\nIn early April, as the Allied forces advanced deeper into Germany, Kammler ordered the engineering team, around 450 specialists, to be moved by train into the town of Oberammergau in the Bavarian Alps, where they were closely guarded by the SS with orders to execute the team if they were about to fall into enemy hands. However, von Braun managed to convince SS Major Kummer to order the dispersal of the group into nearby villages so that they would not be an easy target for U.S. bombers.[53] On 29 April 1945, Oberammergau was captured by the Allied forces who seized the majority of the engineering team.\nVon Braun and several members of the engineering team, including Dornberger, made it to Austria.[55] On 2 May 1945, upon finding an American private from the U.S. 44th Infantry Division, von Braun's brother and fellow rocket engineer, Magnus, approached the soldier on a bicycle, calling out in broken English: \"My name is Magnus von Braun. My brother invented the V-2. We want to surrender.\"[10][56] After the surrender, Wernher von Braun spoke to the press:\n\nWe knew that we had created a new means of warfare, and the question as to what nation, to what victorious nation we were willing to entrust this brainchild of ours was a moral decision more than anything else. We wanted to see the world spared another conflict such as Germany had just been through, and we felt that only by surrendering such a weapon to people who are guided not by the laws of materialism but by Christianity and humanity could such an assurance to the world be best secured.[57]\n\nThe American high command was well aware of how important their catch was: von Braun had been at the top of the Black List, the code name for the list of German scientists and engineers targeted for immediate interrogation by U.S. military experts. On 9 June 1945, two days before the originally scheduled handover of the Nordhausen and Bleicherode area in Thuringia to the Soviets, U.S. Army Major Robert B. Staver, Chief of the Jet Propulsion Section of the Research and Intelligence Branch of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in London, and Lt Col R. L. Williams took von Braun and his department chiefs by Jeep from Garmisch to Munich, from where they were flown to Nordhausen. On the following days, a larger group of rocket engineers, among them Helmut Gr\u00f6ttrup, was evacuated from Bleicherode 40 miles (64\u00a0km) southwest to Witzenhausen, a small town in the American Zone.[58] The Red Army eventually took over Thuringia as part of the Soviet occupation zone after 1 July 1945, as agreed by the Yalta Conference.\nVon Braun was briefly detained at the \"Dustbin\" interrogation center at Kransberg Castle, where the elite of the Third Reich's economic, scientific and technological sectors were debriefed by U.S. and British intelligence officials.[59] Initially, he was recruited to the U.S. under a program called Operation Overcast, subsequently known as Operation Paperclip. There is evidence, however, that British intelligence and scientists were the first to interview him in depth, eager to gain information that they knew U.S. officials would deny them. The team included the young L.S. Snell, then the leading British rocket engineer, later chief designer of Rolls-Royce Limited and inventor of the Concorde's engines. The specific information the British gleaned remained top secret, both from the Americans and from the other allies.[citation needed]\n\nAmerican career[edit]\nU.S. Army career[edit]\n Wernher von Braun at a meeting of NACA's Special Committee on Space Technology, 1958\nOn 20 June 1945, U.S. Secretary of State Edward Stettinius Jr. approved the transfer of von Braun and his specialists to the United States as one of his last acts in office; however, this was not announced to the public until 1 October 1945.[60]\nThe first seven technicians arrived in the United States at New Castle Army Air Field, just south of Wilmington, Delaware, on 20 September 1945. They were then flown to Boston and taken by boat to the Army Intelligence Service post at Fort Strong in Boston Harbor. Later, with the exception of von Braun, the men were transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland to sort out the Peenem\u00fcnde documents, enabling the scientists to continue their rocketry experiments.[citation needed]\nFinally, von Braun and his remaining Peenem\u00fcnde staff (see List of German rocket scientists in the United States) were transferred to their new home at Fort Bliss, a large Army installation just north of El Paso. Von Braun would later write he found it hard to develop a \"genuine emotional attachment\" to his new surroundings.[61] His chief design engineer Walther Reidel became the subject of a December 1946 article \"German Scientist Says American Cooking Tasteless; Dislikes Rubberized Chicken\", exposing the presence of von Braun's team in the country and drawing criticism from Albert Einstein and John Dingell.[61] Requests to improve their living conditions such as laying linoleum over their cracked wood flooring were rejected.[61] Von Braun remarked, \"at Peenem\u00fcnde we had been coddled, here you were counting pennies\".[61] Whereas von Braun had thousands of engineers who answered to him at Peenem\u00fcnde, he was now subordinate to \"pimply\" 26-year-old Jim Hamill, an Army major who possessed only an undergraduate degree in engineering.[61] His loyal Germans still addressed him as \"Herr Professor,\" but Hamill addressed him as \"Wernher\" and never responded to von Braun's request for more materials. Every proposal for new rocket ideas was dismissed.[61]\n\n Von Braun's badge at ABMA (1957)\nWhile at Fort Bliss, they trained military, industrial, and university personnel in the intricacies of rockets and guided missiles. As part of the Hermes project, they helped refurbish, assemble, and launch a number of V-2s that had been shipped from Germany to the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico. They also continued to study the future potential of rockets for military and research applications. Since they were not permitted to leave Fort Bliss without military escort, von Braun and his colleagues began to refer to themselves only half-jokingly as \"PoPs\" \u2013 \"Prisoners of Peace\".[62]\nIn 1950, at the start of the Korean War, von Braun and his team were transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, his home for the next 20 years. Between 1952 and 1956,[63] von Braun led the Army's rocket development team at Redstone Arsenal, resulting in the Redstone rocket, which was used for the first live nuclear ballistic missile tests conducted by the United States. He personally witnessed this historic launch and detonation.[64] Work on the Redstone led to development of the first high-precision inertial guidance system on the Redstone rocket.[65]\nAs director of the Development Operations Division of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, von Braun, with his team, then developed the Jupiter-C, a modified Redstone rocket.[66] The Jupiter-C successfully launched the West's first satellite, Explorer 1, on 31 January 1958. This event signaled the birth of America's space program.\nDespite the work on the Redstone rocket, the 12 years from 1945 to 1957 were probably some of the most frustrating for von Braun and his colleagues. In the Soviet Union, Sergei Korolev and his team of scientists and engineers plowed ahead with several new rocket designs and the Sputnik program, while the American government was not very interested in von Braun's work or views and embarked only on a very modest rocket-building program. In the meantime, the press tended to dwell on von Braun's past as a member of the SS and the slave labor used to build his V-2 rockets.[citation needed]\n\nPopular concepts for a human presence in space[edit]\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

However, he was no longer at risk of being sacked \u2013 as American public opinion of Germans began to recover, von Braun found himself increasingly in a position to popularize his ideas. The 14 May 1950 headline of The Huntsville Times (\"Dr. von Braun Says Rocket Flights Possible to Moon\") might have marked the beginning of these efforts. Von Braun's ideas rode a publicity wave that was created by science fiction movies and stories.\n\n Von Braun with President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1960\nIn 1952, von Braun first published his concept of a crewed space station in a Collier's Weekly magazine series of articles titled \"Man Will Conquer Space Soon!\". These articles were illustrated by the space artist Chesley Bonestell and were influential in spreading his ideas. Frequently, von Braun worked with fellow German-born space advocate and science writer Willy Ley to publish his concepts, which, unsurprisingly, were heavy on the engineering side and anticipated many technical aspects of space flight that later became reality.\nThe space station (to be constructed using rockets with recoverable and reusable ascent stages) would be a toroid structure, with a diameter of 250 feet (76\u00a0m); this built on the concept of a rotating wheel-shaped station introduced in 1929 by Herman Poto\u010dnik in his book The Problem of Space Travel \u2013 The Rocket Motor. The space station would spin around a central docking nave to provide artificial gravity, and would be assembled in a 1,075-mile (1,730\u00a0km) two-hour, high-inclination Earth orbit allowing observation of essentially every point on Earth on at least a daily basis. The ultimate purpose of the space station would be to provide an assembly platform for crewed lunar expeditions. More than a decade later, the movie version of 2001: A Space Odyssey would draw heavily on the design concept in its visualization of an orbital space station.\nVon Braun envisioned these expeditions as very large-scale undertakings, with a total of 50\u00a0astronauts traveling in three huge spacecraft (two for crew, one primarily for cargo), each 49\u00a0m (160.76\u00a0ft) long and 33\u00a0m (108.27\u00a0ft) in diameter and driven by a rectangular array of 30\u00a0rocket propulsion engines.[67] Upon arrival, astronauts would establish a permanent lunar base in the Sinus Roris region by using the emptied cargo holds of their craft as shelters, and would explore their surroundings for eight weeks. This would include a 400\u00a0km (249\u00a0mi) expedition in pressurized rovers to the crater Harpalus and the Mare Imbrium foothills.\n\n Walt Disney and von Braun, seen in 1954 holding a model of his passenger ship, collaborated on a series of three educational films.\nAt this time, von Braun also worked out preliminary concepts for a human mission to Mars that used the space station as a staging point. His initial plans, published in The Mars Project (1952), had envisaged a fleet of 10 spacecraft (each with a mass of 3,720 metric tonnes), three of them uncrewed and each carrying one 200-tonne winged lander[67] in addition to cargo, and nine crew vehicles transporting a total of 70\u00a0astronauts. The engineering and astronautical parameters of this gigantic mission were thoroughly calculated. A later project was much more modest, using only one purely orbital cargo ship and one crewed craft. In each case, the expedition would use minimum-energy Hohmann transfer orbits for its trips to Mars and back to Earth.\nBefore technically formalizing his thoughts on human spaceflight to Mars, von Braun had written a science fiction novel on the subject, set in the year 1980. However, the manuscript was rejected by no fewer than 18\u00a0publishers.[68] Von Braun later published small portions of this opus in magazines, to illustrate selected aspects of his Mars project popularizations. The complete manuscript, titled Project Mars: A Technical Tale, did not appear as a printed book until December 2006.[69]\nIn the hope that its involvement would bring about greater public interest in the future of the space program, von Braun also began working with Walt Disney and the Disney studios as a technical director, initially for three television films about space exploration. The initial broadcast devoted to space exploration was Man in Space, which first went on air on 9 March 1955, drawing 40 million viewers.[61][70][71]\nLater (in 1959) von Braun published a short booklet, condensed from episodes that had appeared in This Week Magazine before\u2014describing his updated concept of the first crewed lunar landing.[72] The scenario included only a single and relatively small spacecraft\u2014a winged lander with a crew of only two experienced pilots who had already circumnavigated the Moon on an earlier mission. The brute-force direct ascent flight schedule used a rocket design with five sequential stages, loosely based on the Nova designs that were under discussion at this time. After a night launch from a Pacific island, the first three stages would bring the spacecraft (with the two remaining upper stages attached) to terrestrial escape velocity, with each burn creating an acceleration of 8\u20139 times standard gravity. Residual propellant in the third stage would be used for the deceleration intended to commence only a few hundred kilometers above the landing site in a crater near the lunar north pole. The fourth stage provided acceleration to lunar escape velocity, while the fifth stage would be responsible for a deceleration during return to the Earth to a residual speed that allows aerocapture of the spacecraft ending in a runway landing, much in the way of the Space Shuttle. One remarkable feature of this technical tale is that the engineer von Braun anticipated a medical phenomenon that would become apparent only years later: being a veteran astronaut with no history of serious adverse reactions to weightlessness offers no protection against becoming unexpectedly and violently spacesick.\n[check quotation syntax]\n\nReligious conversion[edit]\nIn the first half of his life, von Braun was a nonpracticing, \"perfunctory\" Lutheran, whose affiliation was nominal and not taken seriously.[73] As described by Ernst Stuhlinger and Frederick I. Ordway III: \"Throughout his younger years, von Braun did not show signs of religious devotion, or even an interest in things related to the church or to biblical teachings. In fact, he was known to his friends as a 'merry heathen' (fr\u00f6hlicher Heide).\"[74] Nevertheless, in 1945 he explained his decision to surrender to the Western Allies, rather than Russians, as being influenced by a desire to share rocket technology with people who followed the Bible. In 1946,[75]:469 he attended church in El Paso, Texas, and underwent a religious conversion to evangelical Christianity.[76] In an unnamed religious magazine he stated:\n\nOne day in Fort Bliss, a neighbor called and asked if I would like to go to church with him. I accepted, because I wanted to see if the American church was just a country club as I'd been led to expect. Instead, I found a small, white frame building ... in the hot Texas sun on a browned-grass lot ... Together, these people make a live, vibrant community. This was the first time I really understood that religion was not a cathedral inherited from the past, or a quick prayer at the last minute. To be effective, a religion has to be backed up by discipline and effort.\u2014\u2009von Braun[75]:229\u2013230\nOn the motives behind this conversion, Michael J. Neufeld is of the opinion that he turned to religion \"to pacify his own conscience\",[77] whereas University of Southampton scholar Kendrick Oliver said that von Braun was presumably moved \"by a desire to find a new direction for his life after the moral chaos of his service for the Third Reich\".[78] Having \"concluded one bad bargain with the Devil, perhaps now he felt a need to have God securely at his side\".[79]\nLater in life, he joined an Episcopal congregation,[76] and became increasingly religious.[80] He publicly spoke and wrote about the complementarity of science and religion, the afterlife of the soul, and his belief in God.[81][82] He stated, \"Through science man strives to learn more of the mysteries of creation. Through religion he seeks to know the Creator.\"[83] He was interviewed by the Assemblies of God pastor C. M. Ward, as stating, \"The farther we probe into space, the greater my faith.\"[84] In addition, he met privately with evangelist Billy Graham and with the pacifist leader Martin Luther King Jr. [85]\n\n Von Braun with President Kennedy at Redstone Arsenal in 1963\n Von Braun with the F-1 engines of the Saturn V first stage at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center\n Still with his rocket models, von Braun is pictured in his new office at NASA headquarters in 1970\nConcepts for orbital warfare[edit]\nVon Braun developed and published his space station concept during the time of the Cold War when the U.S. government put the containment of the Soviet Union above everything else. The fact that his space station \u2013 if armed with missiles that could be easily adapted from those already available at this time \u2013 would give the United States space superiority in both orbital and orbit-to-ground warfare did not escape him. In his popular writings, von Braun elaborated on them in several of his books and articles, but he took care to qualify such military applications as \"particularly dreadful\". This much-less-peaceful aspect of von Braun's \"drive for space\" has been reviewed by Michael J. Neufeld from the Space History Division of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.[86]\n\nNASA career[edit]\n Von Braun during the Apollo 11 launch, with binoculars to watch it\nThe U.S. Navy had been tasked with building a rocket to lift satellites into orbit, but the resulting Vanguard rocket launch system was unreliable. In 1957, with the launch of Sputnik 1, a growing belief within the United States existed that it was lagging behind the Soviet Union in the emerging Space Race. American authorities then chose to use von Braun and his German team's experience with missiles to create an orbital launch vehicle. Von Braun had originally proposed such an idea in 1954, but it was denied at the time.[61]\nNASA was established by law on 29 July 1958. One day later, the 50th Redstone rocket was successfully launched from Johnston Atoll in the south Pacific as part of Operation Hardtack I. Two years later, NASA opened the Marshall Space Flight Center at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, and the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) development team led by von Braun was transferred to NASA. In a face-to-face meeting with Herb York at the Pentagon, von Braun made it clear he would go to NASA only if development of the Saturn were allowed to continue.[87] Von Braun became the center's first director on 1 July 1960 and held the position until 27 January 1970.[88]\nVon Braun's early years at NASA included a failed \"four-inch flight\" during which the first uncrewed Mercury-Redstone rocket only rose a few inches before settling back onto the launch pad. The launch failure was later determined to be the result of a \"power plug with one prong shorter than the other because a worker filed it to make it fit\". Because of the difference in the length of one prong, the launch system detected the difference in the power disconnection as a \"cut-off signal to the engine\". The system stopped the launch, and the incident created a \"nadir of morale in Project Mercury\".[89]\nAfter the flight of Mercury-Redstone 2 in January 1961 experienced a string of problems, von Braun insisted on one more test before the Redstone could be deemed man-rated. His overly cautious nature brought about clashes with other people involved in the program, who argued that MR-2's technical issues were simple and had been resolved shortly after the flight. He overruled them, so a test mission involving a Redstone on a boilerplate capsule was flown successfully in March. Von Braun's stubbornness was blamed for the inability of the U.S. to launch a crewed space mission before the Soviet Union, which ended up putting the first man in space the following month.[90] Three weeks later on 5 May, von Braun's team successfully launched Alan Shepard into space. He named his Mercury-Redstone 3 Freedom 7[91]\n\n Charles W. Mathews, von Braun, George Mueller, and Lt. Gen. Samuel C. Phillips in the Launch Control Center following the successful Apollo 11 liftoff on 16 July 1969\nThe Marshall Center's first major program was the development of Saturn rockets to carry heavy payloads into and beyond Earth orbit. From this, the Apollo program for crewed Moon flights was developed. Von Braun initially pushed for a flight engineering concept that called for an Earth orbit rendezvous technique (the approach he had argued for building his space station), but in 1962, he converted to the lunar orbit rendezvous concept that was subsequently realized.[92][93] During Apollo, he worked closely with former Peenem\u00fcnde teammate, Kurt H. Debus, the first director of the Kennedy Space Center. His dream to help mankind set foot on the Moon became a reality on 16 July 1969, when a Marshall-developed Saturn V rocket launched the crew of Apollo 11 on its historic eight-day mission. Over the course of the program, Saturn V rockets enabled six teams of astronauts to reach the surface of the Moon.\nDuring the late 1960s, von Braun was instrumental in the development of the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville. The desk from which he guided America's entry in the space race remains on display there. He also was instrumental in the launching of the experimental Applications Technology Satellite. He traveled to India and hoped that the program would be helpful for bringing a massive educational television project to help the poorest people in that country.[94]\nDuring the local summer of 1966\u201367, von Braun participated in a field trip to Antarctica, organized for him and several other members of top NASA management.[95] The goal of the field trip was to determine whether the experience gained by U.S. scientific and technological community during the exploration of Antarctic wastelands would be useful for the crewed exploration of space. Von Braun was mainly interested in management of the scientific effort on Antarctic research stations, logistics, habitation, and life support, and in using the barren Antarctic terrain like the glacial dry valleys to test the equipment that one day would be used to look for signs of life on Mars and other worlds.[96]\nIn an internal memo dated 16 January 1969,[97] von Braun had confirmed to his staff that he would stay on as a center director at Huntsville to head the Apollo Applications Program. He referred to this time as a moment in his life when he felt the strong need to pray, stating \"I certainly prayed a lot before and during the crucial Apollo flights\".[98] A few months later, on occasion of the first Moon landing, he publicly expressed his optimism that the Saturn V carrier system would continue to be developed, advocating human missions to Mars in the 1980s.[99]\nNonetheless, on 1 March 1970, von Braun and his family relocated to Washington, DC, when he was assigned the post of NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning at NASA Headquarters. After a series of conflicts associated with the truncation of the Apollo program, and facing severe budget constraints, von Braun retired from NASA on 26 May 1972. Not only had it become evident by this time that NASA and his visions for future U.S. space flight projects were incompatible, but also it was perhaps even more frustrating for him to see popular support for a continued presence of man in space wane dramatically once the goal to reach the Moon had been accomplished.\n\n Von Braun and William R. Lucas, the first and third Marshall Space Flight Center directors, viewing a Spacelab model in 1974\nVon Braun also developed the idea of a Space Camp that would train children in fields of science and space technologies, as well as help their mental development much the same way sports camps aim at improving physical development.[20]:354\u2013355[100]\n\nCareer after NASA[edit]\nAfter leaving NASA, von Braun became Vice President for Engineering and Development at the aerospace company Fairchild Industries in Germantown, Maryland, on 1 July 1972.[100]\nIn 1973, during a routine physical examination, von Braun was diagnosed with kidney cancer, which could not be controlled with the medical techniques available at the time.[101] Von Braun continued his work to the extent possible, which included accepting invitations to speak at colleges and universities, as he was eager to cultivate interest in human spaceflight and rocketry, particularly his desire to encourage the next generation of aerospace engineers.\nVon Braun helped establish and promote the National Space Institute, a precursor of the present-day National Space Society, in 1975, and became its first president and chairman. In 1976, he became scientific consultant to Lutz Kayser, the CEO of OTRAG, and a member of the Daimler-Benz board of directors. However, his deteriorating health forced him to retire from Fairchild on 31 December 1976. When the 1975 National Medal of Science was awarded to him in early 1977, he was hospitalized, and unable to attend the White House ceremony.\n\nEngineering philosophy[edit]\nVon Braun's insistence on further tests after Mercury-Redstone 2 flew higher than planned has been identified as contributing to the Soviet Union's success in launching the first human in space.[102] The Mercury-Redstone BD flight was successful, but took up the launch slot that could have put Alan Shepard into space three weeks ahead of Yuri Gagarin. His Soviet counterpart Sergei Korolev insisted on two successful flights with dogs before risking Gagarin's life on a crewed attempt. The second test flight took place one day after the Mercury-Redstone BD mission.[20]\nVon Braun took a very conservative approach to engineering, designing with ample safety factors and redundant structure. This became a point of contention with other engineers, who struggled to keep vehicle weight down so that payload could be maximized. As noted above, his excessive caution likely led to the U.S. losing the race to put a man into space with the Soviets. Krafft Ehricke likened von Braun's approach to building the Brooklyn Bridge.[103]:208 Many at NASA headquarters jokingly referred to Marshall as the \"Chicago Bridge and Iron Works\", but acknowledged that the designs worked.[104] The conservative approach paid off when a fifth engine was added to the Saturn C-4, producing the Saturn V. The C-4 design had a large crossbeam that could easily absorb the thrust of an additional engine.[20]:371\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n Maria von Braun, wife of Wernher von Braun\nVon Braun had a charismatic personality and was known as a ladies' man. As a student in Berlin, he would often be seen in the evenings in the company of two girlfriends at once.[20]:63 He later had a succession of affairs within the secretarial and computer pool at Peenem\u00fcnde.[20]:92\u201394\nAccording to a 2015 book The Hidden World Part 2, von Braun had a secret relationship with another test pilot and ardent Nazi, Hanna Reitsch, and in 1932 the pair had a child, Alicia Webber. She also had a relationship with the already married, German-born Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, who in turn fathered Webber's daughter, Alicia von Bielefeld (born (1952-02-21)21 February 1952).[105]\nIn January 1943, von Braun became engaged to Dorothee Brill, a physical education teacher in Berlin, and he sought permission to marry from the SS Race and Settlement Office. However, the engagement was broken due to his mother's opposition.[20]:146\u2013147 Later in 1943 he had an affair with a French woman while in Paris preparing V-2 launch sites in northeastern France. She was imprisoned for collaboration after the war and became destitute.[20]:147\u2013148\nDuring his stay at Fort Bliss, von Braun proposed marriage to Maria Luise von Quistorp (born (1928-06-10)10 June 1928), his maternal first cousin, in a letter to his father. He married her in a Lutheran church in Landshut, Bavaria on 1 March 1947, having received permission to go back to Germany and return with his bride. He was 35 and his new bride was 18.[106] Shortly after, he became an evangelical Christian. He returned to New York on 26 March 1947, with his wife, father, and mother. On 8 December 1948, the von Brauns' first daughter together Iris Careen was born at Fort Bliss Army Hospital.[29] The couple had two more children: Margrit C\u00e9cile, born 8 May 1952,[107] and Peter Constantine, born 2 June 1960.[107]\nOn 15 April 1955, von Braun became a naturalized citizen of the United States.\n\nDeath[edit]\n Grave of Wernher von Braun in Ivy Hill Cemetery (Alexandria, Virginia), 2008.\nIn 1973, von Braun was diagnosed with kidney cancer during a routine medical examination. However, he continued to work unrestrained for a number of years. In January 1977, now very ill, he resigned from Fairchild Industries. Later in 1977, President Gerald Ford awarded him the country's highest science honor, the National Medal of Science in Engineering. He was, however, too ill to attend the White House ceremony.[108]\nVon Braun died on 16 June 1977 of pancreatic cancer in Alexandria, Virginia at age 65.[109][110] He is buried at the Ivy Hill Cemetery. His gravestone cites Psalm 19:1: \"The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork\" (KJV).[111]\n\nRecognition and critique[edit]\n In 1970, Huntsville, Alabama honored von Braun's years of service with a series of events including the unveiling of a plaque in his honor. Pictured (l\u2013r), his daughter Iris, wife Maria, U.S. Sen. John Sparkman, Alabama Gov. Albert Brewer, von Braun, son Peter, and daughter Margrit.\nApollo program director Sam Phillips was quoted as saying that he did not think that the United States would have reached the Moon as quickly as it did without von Braun's help. Later, after discussing it with colleagues, he amended this to say that he did not believe the United States would have reached the Moon at all.[13]:167\nIn a TV interview on the occasion of the US Moon landing in July 1969, Helmut Gr\u00f6ttrup, staff member in Peenem\u00fcnde and later head of the German collective in the Soviet rocketry program, set up the thesis that automatic space probes can get the same amount of scientific data with an effort of only 10 or 20 percent of the costs, and that the money should be better spent on other purposes. Von Braun justified the expenses for manned operations with the following argument: \"I think somehow space flights for the first time give mankind a chance to become immortal. Once this earth will no longer be able to support life we can emigrate to other places which are better suited for our life.\"[112]\nThe von Braun crater on the Moon is named after him.\nVon Braun received a total of 12 honorary doctorates; among them, on 8 January 1963, one from the Technical University of Berlin, from which he had graduated.\nVon Braun was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1967.\nIn Huntsville, Alabama:\nVon Braun was responsible for the creation of the Research Institute at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. As a result of his vision, the university is one of the leading universities in the nation for NASA-sponsored research. The building housing the university's Research Institute was named in his honor, Von Braun Research Hall, in 2000.\nThe Von Braun Center (built in 1975) in Huntsville is named in von Braun's honor.\nThe Von Braun Astronomical Society in Huntsville was founded as the Rocket City Astronomical Association by von Braun and was later renamed after him.\nSeveral German cities (Bonn, Neu-Isenburg, Mannheim, Mainz), and dozens of smaller towns have streets named after von Braun.\nScrutiny of von Braun's use of forced labor at Mittelwerk intensified again in 1984 when Arthur Rudolph, one of his top affiliates from the A-4/V2 through the Apollo projects, left the United States and was forced to renounce his citizenship in place of the alternative of being tried for war crimes.[5][113]\nA science- and engineering-oriented Gymnasium in Friedberg, Bavaria was named after von Braun in 1979. In response to rising criticism, a school committee decided in 1995, after lengthy deliberations, to keep the name but \"to address von Braun's ambiguity in the advanced history classes\". In 2012, Nazi concentration camp survivor David Salz gave a speech in Friedberg, calling out to the public to \"Do everything to make this name disappear from this school!\".[114][115] In February 2014, the school was finally renamed \"Staatliches Gymnasium Friedberg\" and distanced itself from the name von Braun, citing he was \"no role-model for our pupils\".\nAn avenue in the Annadale section of Staten Island, New York, was named after him in 1977.\nVon Braun was voted into the U.S. Space and Rocket Center Hall of Fame in 2007.\nSummary of SS career[edit]\nSS number: 185,068\nNazi Party number: 5,738,692[20]:96\nDates of rank[edit]\nSS-Anw\u00e4rter: 1 November 1933 (Candidate; received rank upon joining SS Riding School)\nSS-Mann: July 1934 (Private)\n(left SS after graduation from the school; commissioned in 1940 with date of entry backdated to 1934)\n\nSS-Untersturmf\u00fchrer: 1 May 1940 (Second Lieutenant)\nSS-Obersturmf\u00fchrer: 9 November 1941 (First Lieutenant)\nSS-Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer: 9 November 1942 (Captain)\nSS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer: 28 June 1943 (Major)[27]\nHonors[edit]\n\n\n\nWar Merit Cross, First Class with Swords in 1943\nKnights Cross of the War Merit Cross in 1944\nElected Honorary Fellow of the British Interplanetary Society in 1949[116]\nCommander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1959\nElliott Cresson Medal in 1962[117]\nInducted into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame in 1965[118]\nLangley Gold Medal in 1967[119]\n\n\n\n\nNASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1969\nInducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1969\nWilhelm Exner Medal in 1969.[2]\nNational Medal of Science in 1975\nWerner von Siemens Ring in 1975\nGolden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1975[120]\nCivitan International World Citizenship Award in 1970[121]\nNational Aviation Hall of Fame (1982)[122]\n\n\n\nIn popular culture[edit]\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
