He refined and developed electronic circuitry to the integrated circuit level. This led to the beginning of the integrated circuit industry.[1]\n Buie was born in 1920 in Hollywood, California.[2] He served in World War II as an airplane pilot and became a lieutenant commander during his service.[2]\n Buie was an electrical engineering graduate of University of Southern California receiving a BSEE in 1950.[3] Buie's first job was at Pacific Semiconductors (PSI) in Culver City, California in 1951. He worked on transistor circuitry as related to diodes and resistors.[4] He was next employed by Ramo-Woolridge Corporation in 1954.[2]\nRamo-Woolridge joined with Thompson Automotive Group in 1958 and eventually Thompson-Ramo-Woolridge became known as TRW Inc. Buie was a senior scientist and one of the organizers for TRW's Microelectronics Center that formed in 1963.[5] He headed TRW's large scale integration LSI Products Division in 1977.[2]\n Buie invented transistor-to-transistor logic circuitry (\"TTL\") in 1961 leading to the development of the integrated circuit industry.[1][2][6][7][8][9][10] Buie's technology technique was originally known as transistor-coupled transistor logic \u2013 TCTL.[11] The TTL electronics invented by Buie became the electronics industry standard for two decades.[12] The first commercial integrated circuit products using the TTL technology were made by Sylvania in 1963\nand known as the Sylvania Universal High-Level Logic family.[13][14]\n Texas Instruments introduced integrated circuits for military applications in 1964. Buie's technology pioneered the development of microelectronics for man-made satellites used in space for the aerospace industry.[15] The integrated circuit technology was used extensively in the 1970s and 1980s in computers, communications, and military equipment.[15] TRW licensed the new technology to other companies to use in data processing and communications electronics.
