He is a co-inventor of the Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman (RSA) algorithm (along with Ron Rivest and Len Adleman), a co-inventor of the Feige\u2013Fiat\u2013Shamir identification scheme (along with Uriel Feige and Amos Fiat), one of the inventors of differential cryptanalysis and has made numerous contributions to the fields of cryptography and computer science.[3]\n Born in Tel Aviv, Shamir received a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in mathematics from Tel Aviv University in 1973 and obtained his Master of Science (MSc) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in Computer Science from the Weizmann Institute in 1975 and 1977 respectively.[2]\n After a year as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Warwick, he did research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1977\u20131980 before returning to be a member of the faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Weizmann Institute. Starting from 2006, he is also an invited professor at \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris.\n In addition to RSA, Shamir's other numerous inventions and contributions to cryptography include the Shamir secret sharing scheme, the breaking of the Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem, visual cryptography, and the TWIRL and TWINKLE factoring devices. Together with Eli Biham, he discovered differential cryptanalysis in the late 1980s, a general method for attacking block ciphers. It later emerged that differential cryptanalysis was already known \u2014 and kept a secret \u2014 by both IBM[4] and the National Security Agency (NSA).[5]\n Shamir has also made contributions to computer science outside of cryptography, such as finding the first linear time algorithm for 2-satisfiability[6] and showing the equivalence of the complexity classes PSPACE and IP.\n Shamir has received a number of awards, including the following:\n He was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 2019.\n \"All text published under the heading 'Biography' on Fellow profile pages is available under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\" --Royal Society Terms, conditions and policies at the Wayback Machine (archived 2016-11-11) \n ", "tags": ["1952 births", "Living people", "People from Tel Aviv", "Alumni of the University of Warwick", "Tel Aviv University alumni", "Modern cryptographers", "Public-key cryptographers", "Israeli mathematicians", "Israeli Jews", "Israel Prize in computer sciences recipients", "20th-century mathematicians", "21st-century mathematicians", "Israeli computer scientists", "Turing Award laureates", "Israeli cryptographers", "Weizmann Institute of Science faculty", "Members of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Jewish inventors", "Jewish scientists", "International Association for Cryptologic Research fellows", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Members of the American Philosophical Society", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from February 2019", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Adi ShamirAdi Shamir at the Royal Society admissions day in London, July 2018Born (1952-07-06) July 6, 1952 (age\u00a068)Tel Aviv, IsraelAlma\u00a0materTel Aviv UniversityWeizmann Institute of ScienceKnown\u00a0forRSAFeige\u2013Fiat\u2013Shamir identification schemedifferential cryptanalysisAwards\nErd\u0151s Prize (1983)\nParis Kanellakis Award (1996)\nTuring Award (2002)\nForeign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences (2005)\nIsrael Prize (2008)\nForeign Member of the Royal Society (2018)[1]\nScientific careerFieldsCryptographyInstitutionsWeizmann InstituteMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyThesisFixed Points of Recursive Programs and their Relation in Differential Agard Calculus\u00a0(1977)Doctoral advisorZohar Manna[2]Doctoral studentsEli Biham  Uriel Feige  Amos Fiat[2]\nWebsitewww.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/profile/scientists/shamir-profile.html\nAdi Shamir (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05d3\u05d9 \u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u200e; born July 6, 1952) is an Israeli cryptographer.
