{"name": "John Forbes Nash Jr.", "content": "\n John Forbes Nash Jr. (June 13, 1928\u00a0\u2013 May 23, 2015) was an American mathematician who made fundamental contributions to game theory, differential geometry, and the study of partial differential equations.[2][3] Nash's work has provided insight into the factors that govern chance and decision-making inside complex systems found in everyday life.\n His theories are widely used in economics. Serving as a senior research mathematician at Princeton University during the later part of his life, he shared the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with game theorists Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi. In 2015, he also shared the Abel Prize with Louis Nirenberg for his work on nonlinear partial differential equations. John Nash is the only person to be awarded both the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and the Abel Prize.\n In 1959, Nash began showing clear signs of mental illness, and spent several years at psychiatric hospitals being treated for schizophrenia. After 1970, his condition slowly improved, allowing him to return to academic work by the mid-1980s.[4] His struggles with his illness and his recovery became the basis for Sylvia Nasar's biography, A Beautiful Mind, as well as a film of the same name starring Russell Crowe as Nash.[5][6][7]\n On May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife Alicia died in a car crash while riding in a taxi on the New Jersey Turnpike.\n Nash was born on June 13, 1928, in Bluefield, West Virginia. His father, John Forbes Nash, was an electrical engineer for the Appalachian Electric Power Company. His mother, Margaret Virginia (n\u00e9e Martin) Nash, had been a schoolteacher before she was married. He was baptized in the Episcopal Church.[8] He had a younger sister, Martha (born November 16, 1930).[9]\n Nash attended kindergarten and public school, and he learned from books provided by his parents and grandparents.[9] Nash's parents pursued opportunities to supplement their son's education, and arranged for him to take advanced mathematics courses at a local community college during his final year of high school. He attended Carnegie Institute of Technology (which later became Carnegie Mellon University) through a full benefit of the George Westinghouse Scholarship, initially majoring in chemical engineering. He switched to a chemistry major and eventually, at the advice of his teacher John Lighton Synge, to mathematics.  After graduating in 1948 (at age 19) with both a B.S. and M.S. in mathematics, Nash accepted a scholarship to Princeton University, where he pursued further graduate studies in mathematics and sciences .[9]\n Nash's adviser and former Carnegie professor Richard Duffin wrote a letter of recommendation for Nash's entrance to Princeton stating, \"He is a mathematical genius.\"[10][11]  Nash was also accepted at Harvard University. However, the chairman of the mathematics department at Princeton, Solomon Lefschetz, offered him the John S. Kennedy fellowship, convincing Nash that Princeton valued him more.[12] Further, he considered Princeton more favorably because of its proximity to his family in Bluefield.[9] At Princeton, he began work on his equilibrium theory, later known as the Nash equilibrium.[13]\n Nash earned a PhD in 1950 with a 28-page dissertation on non-cooperative games.[14][15]\n The thesis, written under the supervision of doctoral advisor Albert W. Tucker, contained the definition and properties of the Nash equilibrium, a crucial concept in non-cooperative games. It won Nash the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994.\n Publications authored by Nash relating to the concept are in the following papers\u00a0:\n Nash did groundbreaking work in the area of real algebraic geometry:\n His work in mathematics includes the Nash embedding theorem, which shows that every abstract Riemannian manifold can be isometrically realized as a submanifold of Euclidean space. Nash also made significant contributions to the theory of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations, and to singularity theory.\n Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov writes about Nash's work:\n Nash was solving classical mathematical problems, difficult problems, something that nobody else was able to do, not even to imagine how to do it. ...\u00a0But what Nash discovered in the course of his constructions of isometric embeddings is far from 'classical'\u00a0\u2014 it is something that brings about a dramatic alteration of our understanding of the basic logic of analysis and differential geometry. Judging from the classical perspective, what Nash has achieved in his papers is as impossible as the story of his life\u00a0... [H]is work on isometric immersions\u00a0... opened a new world of mathematics that stretches in front of our eyes in yet unknown directions and still waits to be explored.[16] John Milnor gives a list of 21 publications.[17]\n In the Nash biography A Beautiful Mind, author Sylvia Nasar explains that Nash was working on proving Hilbert's nineteenth problem, a theorem involving elliptic partial differential equations when, in 1956, he suffered a severe disappointment. He learned that an Italian mathematician, Ennio de Giorgi, had published a proof just months before Nash achieved his. Each took different routes to get to their solutions. The two mathematicians met each other at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University during the summer of 1956. It has been speculated that if only one had solved the problem, he would have been given the Fields Medal for the proof.[9]\n In 2011, the National Security Agency declassified letters written by Nash in the 1950s, in which he had proposed a new encryption\u2013decryption machine.[18] The letters show that Nash had anticipated many concepts of modern cryptography, which are based on computational hardness.[19]\n Although Nash's mental illness first began to manifest in the form of paranoia, his wife later described his behavior as erratic. Nash seemed to believe that all men who wore red ties were part of a communist conspiracy against him. He mailed letters to embassies in Washington, D.C., declaring that they were establishing a government.[4][20] Nash's psychological issues crossed into his professional life when he gave an American Mathematical Society lecture at Columbia University in early 1959. Originally intended to present proof of the Riemann hypothesis, the lecture was incomprehensible. Colleagues in the audience immediately realized that something was wrong.[21]\n He was admitted to McLean Hospital in April 1959, staying through May of the same year. There, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, a person suffering from the disorder is typically dominated by relatively stable, often paranoid, fixed beliefs that are either false, over-imaginative or unrealistic, and usually accompanied by experiences of seemingly real perception of something not actually present.  Further signs are marked particularly by auditory and perceptional disturbances, a lack of motivation for life, and mild clinical depression.[22][23]\n In 1961, Nash was admitted to the New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton.[24] Over the next nine years, he spent periods in psychiatric hospitals, where he received both antipsychotic medications and insulin shock therapy.[23][25][26]\n Although he sometimes took prescribed medication, Nash later wrote that he did so only under pressure. After 1970, he was never committed to a hospital again, and he refused any further medication. According to Nash, the film A Beautiful Mind inaccurately implied he was taking the new atypical antipsychotics of the time period. He attributed the depiction to the screenwriter who was worried about the film's encouraging people with the disorder to stop taking their medication.[27]\n Nash felt psychotropic drugs were overrated and that the adverse effects were not given enough consideration once someone was deemed mentally ill.[28][29][30] According to Sylvia Nasar, author of the book A Beautiful Mind, on which the movie was based, Nash recovered gradually with the passage of time. Encouraged by his then former wife, de Lard\u00e9, Nash lived at home and spent his time in the Princeton mathematics department where his eccentricities were accepted even when his condition was poor. De Lard\u00e9 credits his recovery to maintaining \"a quiet life\" with social support.[4]\n Nash dated the start of what he termed \"mental disturbances\" to the early months of 1959, when his wife was pregnant. He described a process of change \"from scientific rationality of thinking into the delusional thinking characteristic of persons who are psychiatrically diagnosed as 'schizophrenic' or 'paranoid schizophrenic'\".[9] For Nash, this included seeing himself as a messenger or having a special function of some kind, of having supporters and opponents and hidden schemers, along with a feeling of being persecuted and searching for signs representing divine revelation.[31] Nash suggested his delusional thinking was related to his unhappiness, his desire to feel important and be recognized, and his characteristic way of thinking, saying, \"I wouldn't have had good scientific ideas if I had thought more normally.\" He also said, \"If I felt completely pressureless I don't think I would have gone in this pattern\".[32] He did not draw a categorical distinction between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.[failed verification][33] Nash reported he did not hear voices until around 1964, and later engaged in a process of consciously rejecting them.[34] He further stated he was always taken to hospitals against his will. He only temporarily renounced his \"dream-like delusional hypotheses\" after being in a hospital long enough to decide he would superficially conform\u00a0\u2014 to behave normally or to experience \"enforced rationality\". Only gradually on his own did he \"intellectually reject\" some of the \"delusionally influenced\" and \"politically oriented\" thinking as a waste of effort. By 1995, however, even though he was \"thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists,\" he said he felt more limited.[9][35]\n Nash wrote in 1994:\n I spent times of the order of five to eight months in hospitals in New Jersey, always on an involuntary basis and always attempting a legal argument for release. And it did happen that when I had been long enough hospitalized that I would finally renounce my delusional hypotheses and revert to thinking of myself as a human of more conventional circumstances and return to mathematical research. In these interludes of, as it were, enforced rationality, I did succeed in doing some respectable mathematical research. Thus there came about the research for \"Le probl\u00e8me de Cauchy pour les \u00e9quations diff\u00e9rentielles d'un fluide g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\"; the idea that Prof. [Heisuke] Hironaka called \"the Nash blowing-up transformation\"; and those of \"Arc Structure of Singularities\" and \"Analyticity of Solutions of Implicit Function Problems with Analytic Data\".\n But after my return to the dream-like delusional hypotheses in the later 60s I became a person of delusionally influenced thinking but of relatively moderate behavior and thus tended to avoid hospitalization and the direct attention of psychiatrists.\n \nThus further time passed. Then gradually I began to intellectually reject some of the delusionally influenced lines of thinking which had been characteristic of my orientation. This began, most recognizably, with the rejection of politically oriented thinking as essentially a hopeless waste of intellectual effort. So at the present time I seem to be thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists.[9] In 1978, Nash was awarded the John von Neumann Theory Prize for his discovery of non-cooperative equilibria, now called Nash Equilibria. He won the Leroy P. Steele Prize in 1999.\n In 1994, he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (along with John Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten) as a result of his game theory work as a Princeton graduate student.[36] In the late 1980s, Nash had begun to use email to gradually link with working mathematicians who realized that he was the John Nash and that his new work had value. They formed part of the nucleus of a group that contacted the Bank of Sweden's Nobel award committee and were able to vouch for Nash's mental health ability to receive the award in recognition of his early work.[37]\n Nash's later work involved ventures in advanced game theory, including partial agency, which show that, as in his early career, he preferred to select his own path and problems. Between 1945 and 1996, he published 23 scientific studies.\n Nash has suggested hypotheses on mental illness. He has compared not thinking in an acceptable manner, or being \"insane\" and not fitting into a usual social function, to being \"on strike\" from an economic point of view. He advanced views in evolutionary psychology about the value of human diversity and the potential benefits of apparently nonstandard behaviors or roles.[38]\n Nash developed work on the role of money in society. Within the framing theorem that people can be so controlled and motivated by money that they may not be able to reason rationally about it, he criticized interest groups that promote quasi-doctrines based on Keynesian economics that permit manipulative short-term inflation and debt tactics that ultimately undermine currencies. He suggested a global \"industrial consumption price index\" system that would support the development of more \"ideal money\" that people could trust rather than more unstable \"bad money.\" He noted that some of his thinking parallels economist and political philosopher Friedrich Hayek's thinking regarding money and a nontypical viewpoint of the function of the authorities.[39][40]\n Nash received an honorary degree, Doctor of Science and Technology, from Carnegie Mellon University in 1999, an honorary degree in economics from the University of Naples Federico II on March 19, 2003,[41] an honorary doctorate in economics from the University of Antwerp in April 2007, an honorary doctorate of science from the City University of Hong Kong on November 8, 2011,[1] and was keynote speaker at a conference on game theory.[42] Nash also received honorary doctorates from two West Virginia colleges: the University of Charleston in 2003 and West Virginia University Tech in 2006. He was a prolific guest speaker at a number of world-class events, such as the Warwick Economics Summit in 2005 held at the University of Warwick. In 2012, he was elected as a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[43]\n On May 19, 2015, a few days before his death, Nash, along with Louis Nirenberg, was awarded the 2015 Abel Prize by King Harald V of Norway at a ceremony in Oslo.[44]\n In 1951, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) hired Nash as a C. L. E. Moore instructor in the mathematics faculty. About a year later, Nash began a relationship in Massachusetts with Eleanor Stier, a nurse he met while admitted as a patient. They had a son, John David Stier,[1] but Nash left Stier when she told him of her pregnancy.[45] The film based on Nash's life, A Beautiful Mind, was criticized during the run-up to the 2002 Oscars for omitting this aspect of his life. He was said to have abandoned her based on her social status, which he thought to have been beneath his.[46]\n In Santa Monica, California, in 1954, while in his twenties, Nash was arrested for indecent exposure in a sting operation targeting gay men.[47] Although the charges were dropped, he was stripped of his top-secret security clearance and fired from RAND Corporation, where he had worked as a consultant.[48]\n Not long after breaking up with Stier, Nash met Alicia Lard\u00e9 Lopez-Harrison (January 1, 1933 \u2013 May 23, 2015), a naturalized U.S. citizen from El Salvador. Lard\u00e9 graduated from MIT, having majored in physics.[9] They married in February 1957; although Nash was an atheist, the ceremony was performed in an Episcopal church. They had a son together, John Charles Martin Nash, who earned a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Rutgers University and also suffered from schizophrenia as an adult.[49][50][51]\n In 1958, Nash earned a tenured position at MIT, and his first signs of mental illness were evident in early 1959. At this time, his wife was pregnant with their first child. He resigned his position as a member of the MIT mathematics faculty in the spring of 1959[9] and his wife had him admitted to  McLean Hospital for treatment of schizophrenia that same year. Their son, John Charles Martin Nash, was born soon afterward. The child was not named for a year[1] because his wife felt Nash should have a say in the name given to the boy. Due to the stress of dealing with his illness, Nash and Lard\u00e9 divorced in 1963. After his final hospital discharge in 1970, Nash lived in Lard\u00e9's house as a boarder. This stability seemed to help him, and he learned how to consciously discard his paranoid delusions.[52] He stopped taking psychiatric medication and was allowed by Princeton to audit classes. He continued to work on mathematics and was eventually allowed to teach again. In the 1990s, Lard\u00e9 and Nash resumed their relationship, remarrying in 2001.\n On May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife, Alicia Nash, died in a car accident on the New Jersey Turnpike near Monroe Township, New Jersey. They were on their way home from Newark Airport after a visit to Norway, where Nash had received the Abel Prize, when their taxicab driver, Tarek Girgis, lost control of the vehicle and struck a guardrail. Both passengers were ejected from the car upon impact. State police revealed that it appeared neither passenger was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash.[53][54][55][56][57] At the time of his death, the 86-year-old Nash was a longtime resident of New Jersey. He was survived by two sons, John Charles Martin Nash, who lived with his parents at the time of their death, and elder child John Stier.[58][59]\n Following his death, obituaries appeared in scientific and popular media throughout the world.[60] In addition to their obituary for Nash,[61] The New York Times published an article containing quotes from Nash that had been assembled from media and other published sources. The quotes consisted of Nash's reflections on his life and achievements.[62]\n At Princeton, Nash became known as \"The Phantom of Fine Hall\"[63] (Princeton's mathematics center), a shadowy figure who would scribble arcane equations on blackboards in the middle of the night.\n He is referred to in a novel set at Princeton, The Mind-Body Problem, 1983, by Rebecca Goldstein.[4]\n Sylvia Nasar's biography of Nash, A Beautiful Mind, was published in 1998. A film by the same name was released in 2001, directed by Ron Howard with Russell Crowe playing Nash; it won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n ", "tags": ["1928 births", "2015 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Abel Prize laureates", "American atheists", "American Nobel laureates", "Board game designers", "Carnegie Mellon University alumni", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Differential geometers", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Fellows of the Econometric Society", "Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences", "Game theorists", "John von Neumann Theory Prize winners", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Science faculty", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Nobel laureates in Economics", "PDE theorists", "People from Bluefield, West Virginia", "People from West Windsor Township, New Jersey", "People with schizophrenia", "Road incident deaths in New Jersey", "Princeton University alumni", "Princeton University faculty", "Mathematicians from West Virginia", "Mathematicians from New Jersey", "McLean Hospital patients", "LGBT academics", "CS1 Italian-language sources (it)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from December 2017", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "All articles with failed verification", "Articles with failed verification from September 2017", "Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch", "Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata", "Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\"John F.

He only temporarily renounced his \"dream-like delusional hypotheses\" after being in a hospital long enough to decide he would superficially conform\u00a0\u2014 to behave normally or to experience \"enforced rationality\". Only gradually on his own did he \"intellectually reject\" some of the \"delusionally influenced\" and \"politically oriented\" thinking as a waste of effort. By 1995, however, even though he was \"thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists,\" he said he felt more limited.[9][35]\nNash wrote in 1994:\n\nI spent times of the order of five to eight months in hospitals in New Jersey, always on an involuntary basis and always attempting a legal argument for release. And it did happen that when I had been long enough hospitalized that I would finally renounce my delusional hypotheses and revert to thinking of myself as a human of more conventional circumstances and return to mathematical research. In these interludes of, as it were, enforced rationality, I did succeed in doing some respectable mathematical research. Thus there came about the research for \"Le probl\u00e8me de Cauchy pour les \u00e9quations diff\u00e9rentielles d'un fluide g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\"; the idea that Prof. [Heisuke] Hironaka called \"the Nash blowing-up transformation\"; and those of \"Arc Structure of Singularities\" and \"Analyticity of Solutions of Implicit Function Problems with Analytic Data\".\nBut after my return to the dream-like delusional hypotheses in the later 60s I became a person of delusionally influenced thinking but of relatively moderate behavior and thus tended to avoid hospitalization and the direct attention of psychiatrists.\n\nThus further time passed. Then gradually I began to intellectually reject some of the delusionally influenced lines of thinking which had been characteristic of my orientation. This began, most recognizably, with the rejection of politically oriented thinking as essentially a hopeless waste of intellectual effort. So at the present time I seem to be thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists.[9]\nRecognition and later career[edit]\n Nash pictured in 2011\nIn 1978, Nash was awarded the John von Neumann Theory Prize for his discovery of non-cooperative equilibria, now called Nash Equilibria. He won the Leroy P. Steele Prize in 1999.\nIn 1994, he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (along with John Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten) as a result of his game theory work as a Princeton graduate student.[36] In the late 1980s, Nash had begun to use email to gradually link with working mathematicians who realized that he was the John Nash and that his new work had value. They formed part of the nucleus of a group that contacted the Bank of Sweden's Nobel award committee and were able to vouch for Nash's mental health ability to receive the award in recognition of his early work.[37]\nNash's later work involved ventures in advanced game theory, including partial agency, which show that, as in his early career, he preferred to select his own path and problems. Between 1945 and 1996, he published 23 scientific studies.\nNash has suggested hypotheses on mental illness. He has compared not thinking in an acceptable manner, or being \"insane\" and not fitting into a usual social function, to being \"on strike\" from an economic point of view. He advanced views in evolutionary psychology about the value of human diversity and the potential benefits of apparently nonstandard behaviors or roles.[38]\nNash developed work on the role of money in society. Within the framing theorem that people can be so controlled and motivated by money that they may not be able to reason rationally about it, he criticized interest groups that promote quasi-doctrines based on Keynesian economics that permit manipulative short-term inflation and debt tactics that ultimately undermine currencies. He suggested a global \"industrial consumption price index\" system that would support the development of more \"ideal money\" that people could trust rather than more unstable \"bad money.\" He noted that some of his thinking parallels economist and political philosopher Friedrich Hayek's thinking regarding money and a nontypical viewpoint of the function of the authorities.[39][40]\nNash received an honorary degree, Doctor of Science and Technology, from Carnegie Mellon University in 1999, an honorary degree in economics from the University of Naples Federico II on March 19, 2003,[41] an honorary doctorate in economics from the University of Antwerp in April 2007, an honorary doctorate of science from the City University of Hong Kong on November 8, 2011,[1] and was keynote speaker at a conference on game theory.[42] Nash also received honorary doctorates from two West Virginia colleges: the University of Charleston in 2003 and West Virginia University Tech in 2006. He was a prolific guest speaker at a number of world-class events, such as the Warwick Economics Summit in 2005 held at the University of Warwick. In 2012, he was elected as a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[43]\nOn May 19, 2015, a few days before his death, Nash, along with Louis Nirenberg, was awarded the 2015 Abel Prize by King Harald V of Norway at a ceremony in Oslo.[44]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nIn 1951, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) hired Nash as a C. L. E. Moore instructor in the mathematics faculty. About a year later, Nash began a relationship in Massachusetts with Eleanor Stier, a nurse he met while admitted as a patient. They had a son, John David Stier,[1] but Nash left Stier when she told him of her pregnancy.[45] The film based on Nash's life, A Beautiful Mind, was criticized during the run-up to the 2002 Oscars for omitting this aspect of his life. He was said to have abandoned her based on her social status, which he thought to have been beneath his.[46]\nIn Santa Monica, California, in 1954, while in his twenties, Nash was arrested for indecent exposure in a sting operation targeting gay men.[47] Although the charges were dropped, he was stripped of his top-secret security clearance and fired from RAND Corporation, where he had worked as a consultant.[48]\nNot long after breaking up with Stier, Nash met Alicia Lard\u00e9 Lopez-Harrison (January 1, 1933 \u2013 May 23, 2015), a naturalized U.S. citizen from El Salvador. Lard\u00e9 graduated from MIT, having majored in physics.[9] They married in February 1957; although Nash was an atheist, the ceremony was performed in an Episcopal church. They had a son together, John Charles Martin Nash, who earned a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Rutgers University and also suffered from schizophrenia as an adult.[49][50][51]\nIn 1958, Nash earned a tenured position at MIT, and his first signs of mental illness were evident in early 1959. At this time, his wife was pregnant with their first child. He resigned his position as a member of the MIT mathematics faculty in the spring of 1959[9] and his wife had him admitted to  McLean Hospital for treatment of schizophrenia that same year. Their son, John Charles Martin Nash, was born soon afterward. The child was not named for a year[1] because his wife felt Nash should have a say in the name given to the boy. Due to the stress of dealing with his illness, Nash and Lard\u00e9 divorced in 1963. After his final hospital discharge in 1970, Nash lived in Lard\u00e9's house as a boarder. This stability seemed to help him, and he learned how to consciously discard his paranoid delusions.[52] He stopped taking psychiatric medication and was allowed by Princeton to audit classes. He continued to work on mathematics and was eventually allowed to teach again. In the 1990s, Lard\u00e9 and Nash resumed their relationship, remarrying in 2001.\n\nDeath[edit]\nOn May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife, Alicia Nash, died in a car accident on the New Jersey Turnpike near Monroe Township, New Jersey. They were on their way home from Newark Airport after a visit to Norway, where Nash had received the Abel Prize, when their taxicab driver, Tarek Girgis, lost control of the vehicle and struck a guardrail. Both passengers were ejected from the car upon impact. State police revealed that it appeared neither passenger was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash.[53][54][55][56][57] At the time of his death, the 86-year-old Nash was a longtime resident of New Jersey. He was survived by two sons, John Charles Martin Nash, who lived with his parents at the time of their death, and elder child John Stier.[58][59]\nFollowing his death, obituaries appeared in scientific and popular media throughout the world.[60] In addition to their obituary for Nash,[61] The New York Times published an article containing quotes from Nash that had been assembled from media and other published sources. The quotes consisted of Nash's reflections on his life and achievements.[62]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nAt Princeton, Nash became known as \"The Phantom of Fine Hall\"[63] (Princeton's mathematics center), a shadowy figure who would scribble arcane equations on blackboards in the middle of the night.\nHe is referred to in a novel set at Princeton, The Mind-Body Problem, 1983, by Rebecca Goldstein.[4]\nSylvia Nasar's biography of Nash, A Beautiful Mind, was published in 1998. A film by the same name was released in 2001, directed by Ron Howard with Russell Crowe playing Nash; it won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n\nAwards[edit]\n1978 \u2013 INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize\n1994\u00a0\u2013 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences\n1999 \u2013 Leroy P Steele Prize\n2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences[64]\n2010\u00a0\u2013 Double Helix Medal[65]\n2015\u00a0\u2013 Abel Prize[66]\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d Suellentrop, Chris (December 21, 2001). \"A Real Number\".
