{"name": "Wu Wenjun", "content": "\n Wu Wenjun (Chinese: \u5434\u6587\u4fca; 12 May 1919 \u2013 7 May 2017), also commonly known as Wu Wen-ts\u00fcn, was a Chinese mathematician, historian, and writer. He was an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), best known for the Wu's method of characteristic set.\n Wu's ancestral hometown was Jiashan, Zhejiang. He was born in Shanghai and graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 1940. In 1945, Wu taught several months at Hangchow University (later merged into Zhejiang University) in Hangzhou.\n In 1947, he went to France for further study at the University of Strasbourg. In 1949, he received his PhD, for his thesis Sur les classes caract\u00e9ristiques des structures fibr\u00e9es sph\u00e9riques, written under the direction of Charles Ehresmann.  Afterwards, he did some work in Paris with Ren\u00e9 Thom and discovered the Wu class and Wu formula in algebraic topology.  In 1951 he was appointed to a post at Peking University.  However, Wu may have been among a wave of recalls of Chinese academics working in the West following Chiang Kai-shek's ouster from the mainland in 1949, according to eyewitness testimony by Marcel Berger, as he disappeared from France one day, without saying a word to anyone.[1]\n In 1957, he was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 1986 he was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in Berkeley.[2] In 1990, he was elected as an academician of The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS).\n Along with Yuan Longping, he was awarded the State Preeminent Science and Technology Award by President Jiang Zemin in 2000, when this highest scientific and technological prize in China began to be awarded. He also received the TWAS Prize in 1990[3] and the Shaw Prize in 2006. He was the President of the Chinese society of mathematics. He died on May 7, 2017, 5 days before his 98th birthday.[4]\n The research of Wu includes the following fields: algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, game theory, history of mathematics, automated theorem proving.  His most important contributions are to algebraic topology.  The Wu class and the Wu formula are named after him.  In the field of automated theorem proving, he is known for Wu's method.\n He was also active in the field of the history of Chinese mathematics. He was the chief editor\nof the ten-volume Grand Series of Chinese Mathematics, covering the time from antiquity to late part of the Qin dynasty.\n ", "tags": ["1919 births", "2017 deaths", "20th-century Chinese mathematicians", "21st-century Chinese mathematicians", "Algebraic geometers", "Educators from Shanghai", "Historians from Shanghai", "Historians of mathematics", "Mathematicians from Shanghai", "Members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences", "People's Republic of China science writers", "Peking University faculty", "Shanghai Jiao Tong University alumni", "Topologists", "TWAS fellows", "TWAS laureates", "University of Strasbourg alumni", "Writers from Shanghai", "Zhejiang University faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from June 2015", "Articles containing Chinese-language text", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing simplified Chinese-language text", "Articles with Chinese-language sources (zh)", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Chinese mathematician (1919\u20132017)\nIn this Chinese name, the family name is  Wu.\n\n\nWu WenjunBorn(1919-05-12)12 May 1919Shanghai, ChinaDied7 May 2017(2017-05-07) (aged\u00a097)Beijing, ChinaAlma\u00a0materShanghai Jiao Tong UniversityUniversity of StrasbourgAwardsShaw Prize in Mathematics (2006)Highest Science and Technology Award (2000)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsDoctoral advisorCharles Ehresmann\nChinese nameTraditional\u00a0Chinese\u5433\u6587\u4fcaSimplified Chinese\u5434\u6587\u4fcaTranscriptionsStandard MandarinHanyu PinyinW\u00fa W\u00e9nj\u00f9nWade\u2013GilesWu Wen-ch\u00fcn\n\n\nWu Wenjun (Chinese: \u5434\u6587\u4fca; 12 May 1919 \u2013 7 May 2017), also commonly known as Wu Wen-ts\u00fcn, was a Chinese mathematician, historian, and writer.
