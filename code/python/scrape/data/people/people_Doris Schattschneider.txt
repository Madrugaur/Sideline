She is known for writing about tessellations and about the art of M. C.

Wood, Jr., worked as a bridge engineer for New York City.[5] Her family moved to Lake Placid, New York during World War II, while her father served as an engineer for the U. S. Army; she began her schooling in Lake Placid, but returned to Staten Island after the war.[5] She did her undergraduate studies in mathematics at the University of Rochester, and earned a Ph.D. in 1966 from Yale University under the joint supervision of Tsuneo Tamagawa and Ichir\u00f4 Satake; her thesis, in abstract algebra, concerned semisimple algebraic groups.[2][6] She taught at Northwestern University for a year and at the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle for three years before joining the faculty of Moravian College in 1968, where she remained for 34 years until her retirement.[2][7] She was the first female editor of Mathematics Magazine, from 1981 to 1985.[1][2] \nShe was married for 54 years to the Rev.
