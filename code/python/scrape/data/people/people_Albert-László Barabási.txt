{"name": "Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si", "content": "\n Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si (born March 30, 1967) is a Romanian-born Hungarian-American physicist, best known for his work in the research of network theory.\n He is the former Emil T. Hofmann Professor at the University of Notre Dame and current Distinguished Professor and Director of Northeastern University's Center for Complex Network Research (CCNR) associate member of the Center of Cancer Systems Biology (CCSB) at the Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard University, and visiting professor at the Center for Network Science[1] at Central European University.\n He introduced in 1999 the concept of scale-free networks and proposed the Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert model to explain their widespread emergence in natural, technological and social systems, from the cellular telephone to the World Wide Web or online communities. He is the Founding President of the Network Science Society,[2] which grew out of and sponsors the flagship NetSci conference held yearly since 2006.\n Barab\u00e1si was born to an ethnic Hungarian family in C\u00e2r\u021ba, Harghita County, Romania. His father, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si, was a historian, museum director and writer, while his mother, Katalin Keresztes, taught literature, and later became director of a children's theater.[3] He attended a high school specializing in science and mathematics; in the tenth grade, he won a local physics olympiad. Between 1986 and 1989, he studied physics and engineering at the University of Bucharest; during that time, he began doing research on chaos theory, publishing three papers.[3]\n In 1989, Barab\u00e1si emigrated to Hungary, together with his father. In 1991, he received a master's degree at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest, under Tam\u00e1s Vicsek, before enrolling in the Physics program at Boston University, where he earned a PhD in 1994. His thesis, written under the direction of H. Eugene Stanley,[4] was titled Growth and roughening of non-equilibrium interfaces.[5]\n After a one-year postdoc at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Barab\u00e1si joined the faculty at the University of Notre Dame in 1995. In 2000, at the age of 32, he was named the Emil T. Hofman Professor of Physics, becoming the youngest endowed professor. In 2004 he founded the Center for Complex Network Research.\n In 2005\u201306 he was a Visiting Professor at Harvard University. In Fall, 2007, Barab\u00e1si left Notre Dame to become the Distinguished Professor and Director of the Center for Network Science at Northeastern University and to take up an appointment in the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n As of 2008, Barab\u00e1si holds Hungarian, Romanian and U.S. citizenship.[6][7][8]\n \nBarab\u00e1si has been a major contributor to the development of network science and the statistical physics of complex systems. His biggest role has been the independent rediscovery of the scale-free network concept. He reported the scale-free nature of the WWW in 1999 and the same year, in a Science paper with R\u00e9ka Albert, he proposed the Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert model, an undirected version of the Price model,[9] predicting that growth and preferential attachment are jointly responsible for the emergence of the scale-free property in real networks. According to the review of one of Barab\u00e1si's books, preferential attachment can be described as follows: \"Barab\u00e1si has found that the websites that form the network (of the WWW) have certain mathematical properties. The conditions for these properties to occur are threefold. The first is that the network has to be expanding, growing. This precondition of growth is very important as the idea of emergence comes with it. It is constantly evolving and adapting. That condition exists markedly with the world wide web. The second is the condition of preferential attachment, that is, nodes (websites) will wish to link themselves to hubs (websites) with the most connections. The third condition is what is termed competitive fitness which in network terms means its rate of attraction.\"[10] He subsequently showed that the scale-free property emerges in biological systems, namely in metabolic networks and protein\u2013protein interaction networks. In a 2001 paper with R\u00e9ka Albert and Hawoong Jeong he demonstrated the Achilles' heel property of scale-free networks, showing that such networks are robust to random failures but fragile to attacks.[11]\n Barab\u00e1si's contributions to network biology and network medicine include introducing the concept of diseasome, or disease network, showing how diseases link to each other through shared genes and pioneered the use of large patient data to explore disease comorbidity, linking it to molecular network data.[12]\n His work on human dynamics resulted in the discovery of the fat tailed nature of the inter event times in human activity patterns, and proposed the Barab\u00e1si model[13] that showed that a queuing model was capable of explaining the bursty nature of human activity. This topic is covered by his book Bursts.[citation needed]\n His work on network control and observability brought the tools of control theory to network science. It asked how to identify the nodes from which one can control a complex network, just like a car is controlled through three control points, the steering wheel, gas pedal and the brake. By establishing an exact mapping between the dynamical control problem and matching theory, he developed tools to identify the system's control nodes. The same mapping allowed the determination of observers, nodes whose state allows one to reconstruct the state of the full system.[citation needed]\n In 2014, Lior Pachter and his student Nicolas Bray published a three-part analysis of what they deemed questionable papers in computational biology, including some of Barab\u00e1si's work. They argued that Barab\u00e1si has an undeserved reputation for brilliance, because Barab\u00e1si publicizes his work far more intensely than his critics disseminate their refutations.  Pachter and Bray provide a small list of examples, in which Barab\u00e1si's work was subsequently analyzed to be trivially refutable after publication.[14]\n Outside computational biology, critiques have identified various flaws in the methodology of Barab\u00e1si's articles on the scale-freeness of the Web,[15][16] the ubiquity of power-laws in general,[17] and the ubiquity of scale-free networks more specifically,[18] his theories on network control[19] and the dynamics of human activities.[20][21] Barab\u00e1si has also been particularly criticised for failing to acknowledge the contribution of Derek de Solla Price to the scale-free network concept, whose model of citation networks predated the BA model.[22] The BA model is an undirected version of the Price model, although many properties of the two models do not depend on the directedness of edges.[23]\n He was elected a  Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2003.[24] In 2005, he was awarded the FEBS Anniversary Prize for Systems Biology and in 2006 he was awarded the John von Neumann Medal by the John von Neumann Computer Society from Hungary, for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology.[25]\n In 2004, he was elected as an external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In 2007, he was inducted into the Academia Europaea.[26][21]\n In 2008 he received the 2008 C&C Prize, Japan \"for stimulating innovative research on networks and discovering that the scale-free property is a common feature of various real-world complex networks\"[27] and the Cozzarelli Prize, National Academies of Sciences (USA)[28]\n The Lagrange Prize-Crt Foundation was awarded to Barab\u00e1si in June 2011, and in November 2011 he was awarded Honorary degree Doctor Honoris Causa by Technical University of Madrid.[29] In 2017 he received the Senior scientific award of the Complex Systems Society for  \"setting the basis of what is now modern Network Science\".[30] In 2018 Barab\u00e1si has received an honorary doctorate from Utrecht University at the occasion of her 382th Dies Natalis.[31]\n The Bolyai Prize was awarded to Mr. Barab\u00e1si in May 2019 by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, handed over by the President of Hungary, J\u00e1nos \u00c1der. \n ", "tags": ["1967 births", "Living people", "American people of Hungarian-Romanian descent", "21st-century American physicists", "Hungarian physicists", "Romanian physicists", "Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "Complex systems scientists", "Northeastern University faculty", "University of Notre Dame faculty", "Boston University alumni", "University of Bucharest alumni", "Romanian people of Hungarian descent", "People from Harghita County", "Members of Academia Europaea", "Probability theorists", "Harvard Medical School faculty", "Highly Cited Researchers", "Fellows of the American Physical Society", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "Use mdy dates from April 2016", "Articles with hCards", "BLP articles lacking sources from January 2016", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from January 2016", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThe native form of this personal name is Barab\u00e1si Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nAlbert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1siBarab\u00e1si at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of the New Champions in 2012BornBarab\u00e1si Albert L\u00e1szl\u00f3 (1967-03-30) March 30, 1967 (age\u00a054)C\u00e2r\u021ba, Harghita County, RomaniaCitizenshipRomanianHungarianAmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Bucharest (BS) E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University (MS)Boston University (PhD)Known\u00a0forResearch of network theory  the concept of scale-free networksProposal of Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert modelScientific careerFieldsPhysicsThesisGrowth and roughening of non-equilibrium interfaces\u00a0(1994)Doctoral advisorH.
