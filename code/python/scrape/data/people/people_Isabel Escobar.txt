She received her PhD, M.S. and BSc in Environmental Engineering from the University of Central Florida.[3] She was also a United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Science to Achieve Results (STAR) Fellow.[1]\n Escobar has been the lead principal investigator on numerous federally-funded grants and holds one patent for a breakthrough anti-biofouling feed spacer material. She has edited two books, Sustainable Water For the Future: Water Recycling versus Desalination, and Modern Applications in Membrane Science and Technology, and has written numerous papers.\n Escobar focuses her research on the development and improvement of polymeric membrane materials for water treatment and reuse operations. She has been the private investigator of numerous membrane research projects in the field of membrane separations. Among her current projects is work on (1) temperature-sensitive membranes activated using superparamagnetic iron nanoparticles; (2) anti-biofouling membranes; (3) biofouling mechanisms; (4) nanoparticle fouling mechanisms; (5) bio-derived membranes; (6) green membrane fabrication and scale up; and (7) photocatalytic membranes.\n Escobar chaired the 2006 American Water Works Association (AWWA) Desalination Symposium in Honolulu, Hawaii.
