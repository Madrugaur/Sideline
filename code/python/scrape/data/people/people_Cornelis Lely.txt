He oversaw the passage of an act of parliament authorising construction of the Zuiderzee Works, a huge project \u2013 designed to his own plans \u2013 that turned the Zuiderzee into a lake and made possible the conversion of a vast area of former seabed into dry land.[1]\n Cornelis Lely was born on 23 September 1854 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, son of an oilseed trader. Lely went to the Hogere Burgerschool (HBS). He later studied at the Polytechnic School in Delft and graduated as civil engineer in 1875.[2]\n Between 1886 and 1891, Lely led the technical research team that explored the possibility, later approved by a State Commission, of enclosing the Zuiderzee.\n The Dutch parliament passed the law creating the Zuiderzee Works in 14 June 1918, using Lely's plan.[3] He served three times Minister of Transport and Water Management (in 1891\u20131894, 1897\u20131901, and 1913\u20131918) and in this role was hugely influential in advocating the implementation of his own plans.[4] The scheme was finally approved and realised after severe flooding along the shores of the Zuiderzee in 1916.\n In 1898 as minister he implemented a law on local railroads and tramways, which played a significant role in the development of the Dutch countryside.\n In 1895 Lely became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[5] Lely was governor of Surinam from 1902 to 1905.[4] In Surinam he achieved the initiation and construction of the Lawa Railway (from Paramaribo to Benzdorp).\n The city of Lelystad, situated in the Eastern Flevoland polder and capital of Flevoland province, was named after him. The flags of the province and of the city are both adorned with a white fleur-de-lys to note his contribution.\n In the city of Amsterdam \"Cornelis Lelylaan\", a major thoroughfare, is named after him and Amsterdam Lelylaan, one of the city's main railway stations, is sited on this road.\n In 1905, the Surinamese village of Kofi Djompo was renamed Lelydorp in his honour; Lely having led the construction of a new railway from Paramaribo that ran through the area.[6] Most of the railway has now gone, but Lelydorp survives and is now the capital of Wanica District. It lies on the road from Paramaribo to Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport.\n A statue of Lely stands on the western point of the Afsluitdijk. It was sculpted by Mari Andriessen and dedicated on 23 September 1954, the 100th anniversary of Lely's birth. A replica of this statue stands in the center of Lelystad, on a 35-metre-high (115\u00a0ft) tower of basalt blocks, designed by Hans van Houwelingen (artist)\u00a0[nl]. In Lelystad's city hall is a statue of Lely made by Piet Esser.\n ", "tags": ["1854 births", "1929 deaths", "Architects from Amsterdam", "Canal engineers", "Commanders of the Order of the Netherlands Lion", "Delft University of Technology alumni", "Dutch civil engineers", "Dutch technology writers", "Environmental engineers", "Governors of Suriname", "Hydraulic engineers", "Irrigation engineers", "Liberal State Party politicians", "Liberal Union (Netherlands) politicians", "Members of the House of Representatives (Netherlands)", "Members of the Provincial-Council of South Holland", "Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Members of the Senate (Netherlands)", "Ministers of Economic Affairs of the Netherlands", "Ministers of Transport and Water Management of the Netherlands", "Municipal councillors of The Hague", "People from Amsterdam", "Technical writers", "Viaduct engineers", "Water resource management in the Netherlands", "Zuiderzee Works", "19th-century Dutch architects", "19th-century Dutch civil servants", "19th-century Dutch educators", "19th-century Dutch engineers", "19th-century Dutch male writers", "19th-century Dutch politicians", "20th-century Dutch architects", "20th-century Dutch civil servants", "20th-century Dutch educators", "20th-century Dutch engineers", "20th-century Dutch male writers", "20th-century Dutch politicians", "CS1 Dutch-language sources (nl)", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with Dutch-language sources (nl)", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BPN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "His ExcellencyCornelis LelyCornelis Lely in 1913Minister of Water ManagementIn office29 August 1913\u00a0\u2013 9 September 1918Prime MinisterPieter Cort van der LindenPreceded byLouis RegoutSucceeded byAdrianus K\u00f6nigMember of the SenateIn office21 September 1910\u00a0\u2013 29 August 1913Parliamentary groupLiberal UnionGovernor\u2013General of SurinameIn office4 October 1902\u00a0\u2013 12 September 1905MonarchWilhelminaPreceded byWarmolt TonckensSucceeded byDavid Havelaar (Ad interim)Member of the House of RepresentativesIn office17 September 1918\u00a0\u2013 24 June 1922In office23 December 1905\u00a0\u2013 21 September 1909In office21 September 1897\u00a0\u2013 16 August 1902In office16 May 1894\u00a0\u2013 27 July 1897Parliamentary groupLiberal State Party (1921\u20131922)  Liberal Union (1894\u20131921)Minister of Water Management,  Commerce and IndustryIn office27 July 1897\u00a0\u2013 1 August 1901Prime MinisterNicolaas PiersonPreceded byPhilippe van der SleijdenSucceeded byJohannes Christiaan  de Marez OyensIn office21 August 1891\u00a0\u2013 9 May 1894Prime MinisterGijsbert van TienhovenPreceded byJacob HavelaarSucceeded byPhilippe van der Sleijden\nPersonal detailsBornCornelis Lely(1854-09-23)23 September 1854Amsterdam, NetherlandsDied22 January 1929(1929-01-22) (aged\u00a074)The Hague, NetherlandsNationalityDutchPolitical partyLiberal State Party (from 1921)Other politicalaffiliationsLiberal Union (until 1921)Spouse(s)Gerarda van Rinsum\n\u200b \u200b(m.\u00a01881; died\u00a01914)\u200bChildren3 sons and 1 daughterAlma materPolytechnic School  (Bachelor of Engineering, Master of Engineering)OccupationPolitician \u00b7 Civil servant \u00b7 Civil engineer \u00b7 Architect \u00b7 Researcher \u00b7 Author\nCornelis Lely (Dutch pronunciation: [k\u0254r\u02c8ne\u02d0l\u026as \u02c8le\u02d0li]; 23 September 1854 \u2013 22 January 1929) was a Dutch politician of the Liberal Union (LU) and civil engineer.
