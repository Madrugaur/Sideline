{"name": "Daniel Quillen", "content": "Daniel Gray \"Dan\" Quillen (June 22, 1940 \u2013 April 30, 2011) was an American mathematician.\n From 1984 to 2006, he was the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics at Magdalen College, Oxford. He is known for being the \"prime architect\" of higher algebraic K-theory, for which he was awarded the Cole Prize in 1975 and the Fields Medal in 1978.\n Quillen was born in Orange, New Jersey, and attended Newark Academy. He entered Harvard University, where he earned both his AB, in 1961, and his PhD in 1964; the latter completed under the supervision of Raoul Bott, with a thesis in partial differential equations. He was a Putnam Fellow in 1959.[2]\n Quillen obtained a position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after completing his doctorate. He also spent a number of years at several other universities. He visited France twice: first as a Sloan Fellow in Paris, during the academic year 1968\u201369, where he was greatly influenced by Grothendieck, and then, during 1973\u201374, as a Guggenheim Fellow. In 1969\u201370, he was a visiting member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he came under the influence of Michael Atiyah. In 1978, Quillen received a Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Helsinki.[3]\n Quillen retired at the end of 2006. He died from complications of Alzheimer's disease on April 30,\n2011, aged 70, in Florida.[4]\n Quillen's best known contribution (mentioned specifically in his Fields medal citation) was his formulation of higher algebraic K-theory in 1972. This new tool, formulated in terms of homotopy theory, proved to be successful in formulating and solving problems in algebra, particularly in ring theory and module theory.  More generally, Quillen developed tools (especially his theory of model categories) that allowed algebro-topological tools to be applied in other contexts.\n Before his work in defining higher algebraic K-theory, Quillen worked on the Adams conjecture, formulated by Frank Adams, in homotopy theory.[5]  His proof of the conjecture used techniques from the modular representation theory of groups, which he later applied to work on cohomology of groups and algebraic K-theory. He also worked on complex cobordism, showing that its formal group law is essentially the universal one.\n In related work, he also supplied a proof of Serre's conjecture about the triviality of algebraic vector bundles on affine space, which led to the Bass\u2013Quillen conjecture. He was also an architect (along with Dennis Sullivan) of rational homotopy theory.[6]\n He introduced the Quillen determinant line bundle and the Mathai\u2013Quillen formalism.\n ", "tags": ["1940 births", "2011 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century mathematicians", "Deaths from Alzheimer's disease", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Fields Medalists", "Putnam Fellows", "Algebraists", "Topologists", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Harvard University alumni", "People from Orange, New Jersey", "Highly Cited Researchers", "Waynflete Professors of Pure Mathematics", "Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford", "Disease-related deaths in Florida", "Mathematicians from New Jersey", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician known for higher algebraic K-theory,\nDaniel QuillenBorn(1940-06-22)June 22, 1940Orange, New JerseyDiedApril 30, 2011(2011-04-30) (aged\u00a070)Haven Hospice,[1] North FloridaNationalityAmericanKnown\u00a0forAlgebraic K-theory (Quillen's Q-construction), Quillen\u2013Suslin theorem, Bass\u2013Quillen conjecture, rational homotopy theory, Quillen determinant line bundle, Mathai\u2013Quillen formalism, Quillen's lemma, Quillen metric, Quillen's theorems A and BAwardsFields Medal (1978)Cole Prize (1975)Putnam Fellow (1959)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsThesisFormal Properties of Over-Determined Systems of Linear Partial Differential Equations\u00a0(1964)Doctoral advisorRaoul BottDoctoral studentsKenneth BrownVarghese MathaiInfluencesMichael AtiyahAlexander GrothendieckJean-Pierre Serre\n\nDaniel Gray \"Dan\" Quillen (June 22, 1940 \u2013 April 30, 2011) was an American mathematician.\nFrom 1984 to 2006, he was the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics at Magdalen College, Oxford.
