{"name": "Hannah Fry", "content": "\n Hannah Fry (born February 1984[1]) is a mathematician, author, lecturer, radio and television presenter, podcaster and public speaker. She studies the patterns of human behaviour, such as interpersonal relationships and dating, and how mathematics can apply to them.[2][3] Fry delivered the 2019 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures.\n Fry is of Irish descent.[4] She attended Presdales School in Ware, Hertfordshire, England,[5] before studying mathematics at University College London (UCL).[6] In 2011, she was awarded a PhD in fluid dynamics by UCL.[7]\n \nFry was appointed as a lecturer at University College London in 2012. As of 2019[update] she is a senior lecturer at the university's Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis.[8] Fry regularly appears on BBC Radio 4 in the UK, including in Computing Britain (2015, 12 episodes)[9] and The Curious Cases of Rutherford & Fry (with Adam Rutherford), which aired its 17th series in 2020/21.[10]\n She has presented several BBC television programmes. In 2015, Fry presented a BBC Four film biography of Ada Lovelace.[11] In 2016, she co-presented Trainspotting Live with Peter Snow, a three-part series about trains and trainspotting, for the same channel.[12] In the BBC Two series City in the Sky Fry studied the logistics of aviation.[13] She also hosted The Joy of Data on BBC Four, which examines the history and human impact of data.[14] A further credit for 2016 was her co-hosting an episode of the BBC Two Horizon series with Dr Xand van Tulleken, titled \"How to Find Love Online\".[15] In 2017, Fry presented an episode of Horizon titled \"10 Things You Need to Know About the Future\".[16]\n In 2018, she presented Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic, about the possible impact of a flu pandemic,[17] and Magic Numbers, also on BBC Four, a three-part series which explored mathematical concepts.[18] She hosted a one-off 90-minute special of the BBC science programme Tomorrow's World alongside four presenters from the show's original run: Maggie Philbin, Howard Stableford, Judith Hann and Peter Snow.[19]\n In 2019, Fry presented a BBC Four programme titled A Day in the Life of Earth which explored how Earth changes in a single day and how these daily changes are essential to human existence.[20] Fry also co-presented a Horizon episode titled \"The Honest Supermarket\", which covered a range of issues, including expiration dates and their impact on food waste, microplastics in the human food supply and the impact food consumption has on the environment.[21] She presented the 2019 edition of the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, entitled \"Secrets and lies\", on the hidden numbers, rules and patterns that control daily lives;[22] the three lectures were broadcast on BBC Four.[23]\n In 2020, Fry co-presented both The Great British Intelligence Test and Coronavirus Special \u2013 Part 2 with Michael Mosley on BBC Two.[24][25] She has presented further programmes for the BBC explaining the mathematics behind COVID-19 and related pandemics.[26]\n On 30 March 2014, Fry gave a TED talk at TEDxBinghamtonUniversity[27] titled \"The Mathematics of Love\", which as of August\u00a02020[update] has attracted over 5.2 million views.[28] Following the TED talk, she published a book on the topic \u2013 The Mathematics of Love: Patterns, Proofs, and the Search for the Ultimate Equation \u2013 in which she applies statistical and data-scientific models to dating, sex and marriage.[29]\n Fry has appeared in several videos for a YouTube mathematics channel, Numberphile, run by Brady Haran.[30] She has also made an appearance on his podcast: The Numberphile Podcast.[31]\n Fry has written three books. The first, The Mathematics of Love: Patterns, Proofs, and the Search for the Ultimate Equation (2015), includes the \"37% rule\", a form of the secretary problem according to which roughly the first third of any potential partners should be rejected. The second, The Indisputable Existence of Santa Claus (2016, co-authored with fellow mathematician Thomas Ol\u00e9ron Evans), discusses various Christmas-related topics and how mathematics can be involved in them, including a fair Secret Santa, decoration of Christmas trees, winning at Monopoly, and comparing the vocabulary of the Queen's Christmas message to Snoop Dogg.[6] Her third book is Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms (2018) (retitled, and reprinted, in the same year, as Hello World: How to be Human in the Age of the Machine), which looks at the impact of algorithms that affect lives.[32]\n In 2013, Fry won the UCL Provost's Public Engager of the Year award.[33] The award recognises the work that UCL's staff and students are doing to open up the university. Fry was nominated for her broad portfolio of public engagement activities.[33]\n In 2018, the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications and the London Mathematical Society announced that Fry had won that year's Christopher Zeeman Medal \"for her contributions to the public understanding of the mathematical sciences\".[34]\n In 2020, Fry won the Asimov Prize, a literary-scientific award organised by the Italian graduate school Gran Sasso Science Institute, for her book Hello World.[35]\n Fry is married; she and her husband have two daughters.[36][37]\n ", "tags": ["1980s births", "Living people", "21st-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women scientists", "Academics of University College London", "Alumni of University College London", "BBC Radio 4 presenters", "Mathematics education in the United Kingdom", "Mathematics popularizers", "Science communicators", "Mathematics educators", "Royal Institution Christmas Lectures", "TED talk template with ID not in Wikidata", "CS1 Italian-language sources (it)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from September 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2019", "All articles containing potentially dated statements", "Articles containing potentially dated statements from August 2020", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Date of birth missing (living people)", "Place of birth missing (living people)"], "raw": "British mathematician and TV presenter\n\n\nHannah FryFry in 2017BornFebruary\u00a01984 (age\u00a037)[1]Harlow, EnglandAlma\u00a0materUniversity College London (UCL)OccupationMathematician, author, lecturer, radio and television presenter, podcaster and public speakerChildren2Websitewww.hannahfry.co.uk\nHannah Fry (born February 1984[1]) is a mathematician, author, lecturer, radio and television presenter, podcaster and public speaker.
