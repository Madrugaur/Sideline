The mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria noted on a definition of polygonal numbers, due to Hypsicles:[2]\n If there are as many numbers as we please beginning from 1 and increasing by the same common difference, then, when the common difference is 1, the sum of all the numbers is a triangular number; when 2 a square; when 3, a pentagonal number [and so on]. And the number of angles is called after the number which exceeds the common difference by 2, and the side after the number of terms including 1. In On Ascensions (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 and sometimes translated On Rising Times), Hypsicles proves a number of propositions on arithmetical progressions and uses the results to calculate approximate values for the times required for the signs of the zodiac to rise above the horizon.[3] It is thought that this is the work from which the division of the circle into 360 parts may have been adopted[4] since it divides the day into 360 parts, a division possibly suggested by Babylonian astronomy,[5] although this is a mere speculation and no actual evidence is found to support this.

In ancient times it was not uncommon to attribute to a celebrated author works that were not by him; thus, some versions of Euclid's Elements include a fourteenth and even a fifteenth book, both shown by later scholars to be apocryphal. The so-called Book XIV continues Euclid's comparison of the regular solids inscribed in a sphere, the chief results being that the ratio of the surfaces of the dodecahedron and icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes, the ratio being that of the edge of the cube to the edge of the icosahedron, that is, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n3\n(\n5\n\u2212\n\n\n5\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\scriptstyle {\\sqrt {\\frac {10}{3(5-{\\sqrt {5}})}}}}.}\n\n It is thought that this book may have been composed by Hypsicles on the basis of a treatise (now lost) by Apollonius comparing the dodecahedron and icosahedron. (Hypsicles, who probably lived in the second half of the second century B.C., is thought to be the author of an astronomical work, De ascensionibus, from which the division of the circle into 360 parts may have been adopted.)\n\n^ Boyer (1991). \"Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration\".
