{"name": "Kurt Grelling", "content": "Kurt Grelling (2 March 1886 \u2013 September 1942) was a German logician and  philosopher, member of the Berlin Circle.\n Kurt Grelling was born on 2 March 1886 in Berlin. His father, the Doctor of Jurisprudence Richard Grelling, and his mother, Margarethe (n\u00e9e Simon), were Jewish. Shortly after his arrival in 1905 at University of G\u00f6ttingen, Grelling began a collaboration with philosopher Leonard Nelson, with whom he tried to solve Russell's paradox, which had shaken the foundations of mathematics when it was announced in 1903. Their 1908 paper[4] included new paradoxes, including a semantic paradox that was named the Grelling\u2013Nelson paradox.\n He received his doctorate in mathematics from the same university in 1910 with a PhD dissertation on the development of arithmetic in axiomatic set theory, advised by David Hilbert. In a recorded interview with Herbert Enderton, Alfred Tarski mentions a meeting he had with Grelling in 1938, and says that Grelling was the author of the earliest textbook in set theory, probably but wrongly referring to this dissertation, since William Henry Young and Grace Chisholm Young's Set Theory was published in 1906.\n As a skilled linguist, Grelling translated philosophical works from French, Italian and English to German, including four of Bertrand Russell's works. He became a strong proponent of Russell's writings thereafter.\n From 1911 to 1922 Grelling published exclusively journalistic articles in publications connected with the Social Democratic Party of Germany.\n In 1915 his father, Richard Grelling, wrote the anti-war book J'Accuse, condemning the actions of the Central Powers.[5]  It enjoyed huge sales outside Germany. Richard followed this success up with Das Verbrechen (The Crime), in which he attacked his critics, who included Kurt Grelling.[6]\n From 1924 onwards Grelling's publications were exclusively in the field of positivist philosophy.\n Unable to find a university position in either G\u00f6ttingen or Berlin, Grelling had to teach mathematics, philosophy and physics in secondary schools.  Nevertheless, he worked with Hans Reichenbach in planning the meetings of the Berlin Circle, which was closely associated with the Vienna Circle. In 1933, Reichenbach emigrated to Turkey and the Nazis forced Grelling to retire. But he struggled to keep the Berlin Circle active by organizing small seminars and colloquia.\n Grelling collaborated with Kurt G\u00f6del and in 1937 he published an article in which he defended G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem against an erroneous interpretation, according to which G\u00f6del's theorem is a paradox as Russell's paradox.\n Although many of his relatives and friends had fled Germany, he did not think seriously about leaving until 1937, in which year he went to Brussels to work with Paul Oppenheim, this time writing several papers on the analysis of scientific explanation and on Gestalt psychology.\n On 10 May 1940, the first day of the German invasion in Belgium, Grelling was arrested. He was deported to southern France, where he was interned for over two years under the Vichy regime. Oppenheim and Hempel tried to help Grelling by securing an appointment for him at the New School for Social Research in New York City. News of the position and a visa to the United States reached the camp where Grelling had been joined by his wife Greta, who had refused to divorce him for safety reasons. But U.S. immigration officials were perplexed by Grelling's alleged propensity towards Communism, so there was a delay that was fatal to Grelling. He and his wife were shipped to Auschwitz, arriving there on September 18, 1942 and perishing in the gas chambers that day or soon thereafter.[7][8]\n ", "tags": ["20th-century German philosophers", "German people who died in Auschwitz concentration camp", "1886 births", "1942 deaths", "Jewish philosophers", "German logicians", "German civilians killed in World War II", "Writers from Berlin", "People killed by gas chamber by Nazi Germany", "German male writers", "Vienna Circle", "German social democrats", "German Jews who died in the Holocaust", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Kurt GrellingKurt Grelling at work in his study c. 1934Born(1886-03-02)2 March 1886Berlin, German EmpireDiedSeptember 1942Auschwitz-Birkenau, German-occupied PolandEducationUniversity of G\u00f6ttingen (PhD, 1910)Era20th-century philosophyRegionWestern philosophySchoolAnalytic philosophy[1]Berlin CircleThesisDie Axiome der Arithmetik mit besonderer Ber\u00fccksichtigung der Beziehungen zur Mengenlehre (The Axioms of Arithmetic with Particular Regard to their Relation to Set Theory)\u00a0(1910)Doctoral advisorDavid HilbertMain interestsPhilosophy of science, logic, axiomatic set theoryNotable ideasGrelling\u2013Nelson paradox\nInfluences\nDavid Hilbert, Bertrand Russell[2]\n\nInfluenced\nHans Reichenbach[3]\n\n\n Memorial Stolperstein at Kurt Grelling's residence K\u00f6nigsberger Stra\u00dfe 13 in Berlin\nKurt Grelling (2 March 1886 \u2013 September 1942) was a German logician and  philosopher, member of the Berlin Circle.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and work\n2 Selected publications\n3 Notes\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nLife and work[edit]\nKurt Grelling was born on 2 March 1886 in Berlin.
