{"name": "Harold W. Kuhn", "content": "\n Harold William Kuhn (July 29, 1925 \u2013 July 2, 2014) was an American mathematician who studied game theory.  He won the 1980 John von Neumann Theory Prize along with David Gale and Albert W. Tucker.  A former Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Princeton University, he is known for the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions, for Kuhn's theorem, for developing Kuhn poker as well as the description of the Hungarian method for the assignment problem. Recently, though, a paper by Carl Gustav Jacobi, published posthumously in 1890 in Latin, has been discovered that anticipates by many decades the Hungarian algorithm.[1][2]\n Kuhn was born in Santa Monica in 1925.[3] He is known for his association with John Forbes Nash, as a fellow graduate student, a lifelong friend and colleague, and a key figure in getting Nash the attention of the Nobel Prize committee that led to Nash's 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics.[4] Kuhn and Nash both had long associations and collaborations with Albert W. Tucker, who was Nash's dissertation advisor. Kuhn co-edited The Essential John Nash,[5] and is credited as the mathematics consultant in the 2001 movie adaptation of Nash's life, A Beautiful Mind.[6]\n Harold Kuhn served as the third president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.[7]\n In 1949, he married Estelle Henkin, sister of logician Leon Henkin. His oldest son was oral historian Clifford Kuhn (1952-2015), an associate professor at Georgia State University noted for his scholarship on the American South. Another son, Nicholas Kuhn, is a professor of mathematics at the University of Virginia.[8]  His youngest son, Jonathan Kuhn, is Director of Art and Antiquities for the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation.\n Kuhn died on July 2, 2014.[9]\n ", "tags": ["20th-century mathematicians", "1925 births", "Game theorists", "Princeton University faculty", "John von Neumann Theory Prize winners", "Fellows of the Econometric Society", "2014 deaths", "Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences", "Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics", "Presidents of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Use American English from November 2019", "All Wikipedia articles written in American English", "Use mdy dates from November 2019", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For the American professor of philosophy of religion, see Harold B.
