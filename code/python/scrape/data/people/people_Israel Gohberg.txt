His father owned a small typography shop and his mother was a midwife. The young Gohberg studied in a Hebrew school in Taurtyne and then a Romanian school in Orhei, where he was influenced by the tutelage of Modest Shumbarsky, a student of the renowned topologist Karol Borsuk.\n He studied at the Kyrgyz Pedagogical Institute in Bishkek and the University of Chi\u015fin\u0103u, completed his doctorate at Leningrad University on a thesis advised by Mark Krein (1954), and attended the University of Moscow for his habilitation degree.\n Gohberg joined the faculty at Teacher's college in Soroki, at the teachers college in B\u0103l\u021bi before returning to Chi\u015fin\u0103u where he was elected into the Academy of Sciences and also being appointed head of functional analysis at University of Chi\u015fin\u0103u (1964\u201373). After moving to Israel, Israel joined Tel Aviv University (1974) and was at the Weizmann Institute at Rehovot.
