{"name": "Klavdija Kutnar", "content": "Klavdija Kutnar is a Slovene mathematician. She received her PhD at the University of Primorska (UP) in 2008. She is Rector of the University of Primorska.\n Klavdija Kutnar was born 23 December 1980, in Ljubljana, Slovenia. She graduated from the Faculty of Education of the University of Ljubljana in 2003, and in 2008 received her PhD in Mathematics at the University of Primorska under the supervision of Dragan Maru\u0161i\u010d.[1] From 2010-2012 she was head of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Primorska Institute Andrej Maru\u0161i\u010d (UP IAM). In 2012, she was elected dean of the University of Primorska Faculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Information Technology (UP FAMNIT) and since 2015 has concurrently been assistant director of UP IAM. In 2018 she was granted the titles of Research Counsellor and Full Professor in Mathematics at the University of Primorska.[2] In 2019 she was elected the fourth rector of the University of Primorska.[3]\n Kutnar\u2019s main research area is algebraic graph theory. At the beginning of her research career, she also worked in mathematical chemistry. She is noted for her contribution to the study of the structural properties of particular families of symmetric graphs and in particular, her role in developing the original method of embedding graphs on surfaces to solve special cases of the well-known Lov\u00e1sz conjecture: the problem of finding Hamiltonian paths and cycles in vertex-transitive and Cayley graphs. She is a member of the research program P1-0285, financed by the Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS) and led by Prof. Dragan Maru\u0161i\u010d, PhD.[4] In 2018, she was the first Slovenian female mathematician to obtain a basic research project financed by the ARRS (J1-9110).[5]\n Kutnar has been a member of the editorial board of the journal Ars Mathematica Contemporanea since 2016, serving as editor-in-chief from 2018. She is also a member of the editorial boards of the Bulletin of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications and Algebraic Combinatorics, and managing editor of the scientific journal ADAM \u2013 The Art of Discrete and Applied Mathematics.\n She is a Deputy Chair of the Organizing Committee of the 8th European Congress of Mathematics in 2020 and a member of International Advisory Committee for the International Congress of Mathematicians 2022, which will take place in St. Petersburg, Russia.[6]\n She is a founding member and the secretary of the Slovenian Discrete and Applied Mathematics Society.
