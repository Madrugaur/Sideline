{"name": "Manuel Sadosky", "content": "Manuel Sadosky (April 13, 1914 \u2013 June 18, 2005) was an Argentine mathematician, civil servant and author who was born in Buenos Aires to Jewish Russian immigrants who had fled the pogroms in Europe.[1]\n Son of a shoemaker, Natalio Sadosky and his wife Maria Steingart of Ekaterinoslav (currently Dnepropetrovsk), Ukraine,[1] the family had arrived in Argentina in 1905.\n Sadosky studied at the Mariano Acosta teachers school. Noted novelist Julio Cort\u00e1zar was his classmate there, and remained a longtime friend. Since his childhood he was an ardent supporter of San Lorenzo de Almagro.  He married fellow mathematician and activist Cora Ratto de Sadosky (1912\u20131981) in 1937. Biographer Pablo Jacovkis[1] has said that Cora, had a \"powerful personality [that] was not overshadowed by her husband's.\"[1] The couple had one child, mathematician Cora Sadosky (1940\u20132010).\n Sadosky graduated as a Doctor in Physics and Mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires in 1940, under supervision of Esteban Terradas. He then moved to the Henri Poincar\u00e9 Institute in Paris to pursue postdoctoral studies on a scholarship granted by the French Government. After another year in Italy, he returned to Argentina, where he faced complicated employment options because of his opposition to the Peronist regime.\n After a coup d'\u00e9tat of 1955 removed President Juan Per\u00f3n from office, Sadosky took up a position as professor at the University of Buenos Aires, where he was vice-dean of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences from 1957 to 1966.\n In 1960 he was commissioned to develop the Computational Institute (Instituto de C\u00e1lculo) of the university, home of Clementina, a new Ferranti Mercury computer and the first one installed in Argentina for research and education.[2] His staff there included several excellent mathematicians including Cecilia Berdichevsky and Rebeca Cherep de Guber, and both would work closely with him for many years to come.[3]\n He directed the institute until another coup d'\u00e9tat installed a military dictatorship in 1966, causing him to resign with the rest of the faculty in opposition to government intervention in the hitherto autonomous state universities (the Night of the Long Batons) and flee the country.[1]\n He was later able to return to Argentina, but the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance death squad threatened to kill him so he fled with his family in 1974. He moved to Uruguay, finding employment in Montevideo at the Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica, where he continued publishing, helped to initiate computer studies and introduced the first research computer in that country.[3]\n With the eventual return of democracy to Argentina in 1983, president Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn appointed him as Secretary of State of Science and Technology (until 1989).\n One of his major contributions to computer science during this period, was the creation of the ESLAI (Latin American School of Higher Informatics).\n Dr. Manuel Sadosky died in Buenos Aires on June 18, 2005.\n He was named an Illustrious Citizen of the City of Buenos Aires.[4]\n The Computer Science Department of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires is named after him.\n ", "tags": ["1914 births", "2005 deaths", "University of Buenos Aires faculty", "Argentine Jews", "Argentine mathematicians", "Argentine people of Russian-Jewish descent", "Government ministers of Argentina", "Illustrious Citizens of Buenos Aires", "People from Buenos Aires", "CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with Spanish-language sources (es)", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Manuel SadoskyManuel Sadosky and the computer ClementinaBornApril 13, 1914Buenos Aires, ArgentinaDiedJune 18, 2005Buenos Aires, ArgentinaNationalityArgentinianOccupationmathematicianSpouse(s)Corina (Cora) Elo\u00edsa RattoChildrenCora Sadosky (daughter)\nManuel Sadosky (April 13, 1914 \u2013 June 18, 2005) was an Argentine mathematician, civil servant and author who was born in Buenos Aires to Jewish Russian immigrants who had fled the pogroms in Europe.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Bibliography\n\n1.1 Education\n1.2 Computational Institute\n1.3 In exile\n1.4 Later years\n\n\n2 Selected publications\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBibliography[edit]\nSon of a shoemaker, Natalio Sadosky and his wife Maria Steingart of Ekaterinoslav (currently Dnepropetrovsk), Ukraine,[1] the family had arrived in Argentina in 1905.\nSadosky studied at the Mariano Acosta teachers school.
