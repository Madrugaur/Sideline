{"name": "Samson Abramsky", "content": "\n Samson Abramsky FRS, FRSE (born 12 March 1953) is a computer scientist who holds the Christopher Strachey Professorship at the Department of Computer Science (formerly the Computing Laboratory), University of Oxford. He has made contributions to the areas of domain theory, the lazy lambda calculus, strictness analysis, concurrency theory, interaction categories, geometry of interaction, game semantics and quantum computing.[3][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]\n Abramsky was brought up in a Jewish family[13] and educated at Hasmonean Grammar School for Boys, Hendon and at King's College, Cambridge (BA 1975, MA Philosophy 1979, Diploma in Computer Science) and Queen Mary, University of London (PhD Computer Science 1988, supervised by Richard Bornat).[4]\n Since 2016, Abramsky has been a Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford and Christopher Strachey Professor of Computing at Oxford University Department of Computer Science. He has also been a Fellow of the Royal Society since 2004. His research includes the development of game semantics, domain theory in logical form, and categorical quantum mechanics.\n His earlier positions include:\n Abramsky has played a leading role in the development of game semantics, and its applications to the semantics of programming languages. Other notable contributions include his work on domain theory in logical form, the lazy lambda calculus, strictness analysis, concurrency theory, interaction categories, and geometry of interaction. He has recently been working on high-level methods for quantum computation and information.\n Samson Abramsky co-edited 6 Volumes Handbook of Logic in Computer Science with Dov Gabbay and Tom Maibaum.\n Samson Abramsky has published over two hundred publications and his h-index was 57 as of October 2019.[14]\n Some of the recent works of Samson Abramsky include:\n Abramsky is a Fellow of the Royal Society (2004), a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (2000),[15] and a Member of Academia Europaea (1993). He is a member of the Editorial Boards of the North Holland Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics, and of the Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science. He was General Chair of LiCS 2000\u20132003, and is a member of the LiCS Organizing Committee.\n Abramsky's nomination for the Royal Society reads:\n Samson Abramsky is distinguished for seminal contributions to the mathematical foundations of computation. His outstanding achievement is his development of Game Semantics as a theory of computational processes which exposes the mathematical structure of the information flow between them. This has led to powerful applications in the study of programming languages, offering decisive new insights into the nature of sequentiality, state, control, and many other computational features. It is now leading in turn to new developments in computer-assisted program analysis and verification. An important strand, which also stands as a contribution to logic, is a generalisation of Girard's Geometry of Interaction, leading to a new genre of full completeness theorems, which characterise the 'space of proofs' of a logic. Previously, Abramsky made important contributions to abstract interpretation, domain theory, lambda calculus and concurrency. He continues to shed light over a broad range of topics by sharp and creative insights, breaking new ground, and bringing order and unity to existing work.[17] ", "tags": ["1953 births", "Living people", "Alumni of King's College, Cambridge", "Alumni of Queen Mary University of London", "Fellows of Wolfson College, Oxford", "Members of the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford", "Academics of Queen Mary University of London", "Academics of Imperial College London", "Academics of the University of Edinburgh", "British computer scientists", "British Jews", "British people of Belarusian-Jewish descent", "Jewish scientists", "Formal methods people", "Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Members of Academia Europaea", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "EngvarB from August 2014", "Use dmy dates from August 2014", "Pages using Template:Post-nominals with missing parameters", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nSamson AbramskyFRS FRSESamson AbramskyBorn (1953-03-12) 12 March 1953 (age\u00a068)[1]Alma\u00a0mater\nKing's College, Cambridge (BA, MA, Diploma)\nQueen Mary University of London (PhD)\nAwards\nFRS\nFRSE\nLovelace Medal (2013)\nACM Fellow (2014) [2]\nScientific careerFields\nTheoretical computer science\nQuantum information\nGame theory[3]\nInstitutions\nUniversity of Oxford\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nUniversity of Cambridge\nImperial College London\nGeneral Electric Company plc\nThesisDomain Theory and the Logic of Observable Properties\u00a0(1987)Doctoral advisorRichard Bornat[4]\nWebsitewww.cs.ox.ac.uk/samson.abramsky\nSamson Abramsky FRS, FRSE (born 12 March 1953) is a computer scientist who holds the Christopher Strachey Professorship at the Department of Computer Science (formerly the Computing Laboratory), University of Oxford.
