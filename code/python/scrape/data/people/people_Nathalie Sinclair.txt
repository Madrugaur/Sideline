She began her undergraduate studies at McGill University in business, but quickly switched to mathematics, and then earned a master's degree with Len Berggren at Simon Fraser on the history of mathematics and mathematics in medieval Islam.[3]\n She became a middle school teacher of mathematics and French on Bowen Island,[3] Sinclair then earned her Ph.D. in 2002 from Queen's University at Kingston, under the joint supervision of Peter Taylor of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and William Higginson of the Faculty of Education.[4]\n In 2003, Sinclair accepted a joint appointment in the College of Natural Sciences and the College of Education at Michigan State University.[5]\n In 2014, Sinclair and Nicholas Jackiw developed a mathematical app targeted at children ages three to eight.
