{"name": "Sarah Boone", "content": "\n Sarah Boone (1832\u20131904) was an American inventor who on April 26, 1892, obtained United States patent number 473,563[1] for her improvements to the ironing board. Boone's ironing board was designed to improve the quality of ironing sleeves and the bodies of women's garments. The board was very narrow, curved, and made of wood. The shape and structure allowed it to fit a sleeve and it was reversible, so one could iron both sides of the sleeve.[2][3] Along with Miriam Benjamin, Ellen Eglin, and Sarah Goode, Boone was one of four African American women inventors of her time who developed new technology for the home.[4]\n Sarah Marshall was born in Craven County, North Carolina, near the town of New Bern, in 1832.[5] She was formerly enslaved which was brutal.[6] On November 25, 1847, she married James Boone (or Boon) in New Bern;[5][7] they had eight children.[8]\n The Boone family left North Carolina for New Haven, Connecticut,[9] before the outbreak of the American Civil War;[5] they settled into a house at 30 Winter Street.[10] Sarah Boone worked as a dressmaker.[5][11] She belonged to the Dixwell Avenue Congregational Church.[1]\n Sarah Marshall Boone died in 1904 and is buried in a family plot in Evergreen Cemetery in New Haven.[5]\n ", "tags": ["1904 deaths", "19th-century American businesswomen", "African-American inventors", "Women inventors", "19th-century American inventors", "1832 births", "People from Craven County, North Carolina", "19th-century American slaves", "American tailors", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages", "Articles with hCards", "Articles using Template Infobox person Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers"], "raw": "American inventor\n\n\nSarah BooneBornSarah Marshall1832Craven County, North Carolina, USDied1904 (aged\u00a071\u201372)New Haven, Connecticut, USOther\u00a0namesBoonOccupationInventorDressmakerKnown\u00a0forInventor of an ironing board improvement\nSarah Boone (1832\u20131904) was an American inventor who on April 26, 1892, obtained United States patent number 473,563[1] for her improvements to the ironing board.
