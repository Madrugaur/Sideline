{"name": "Fernando Cod\u00e1 Marques", "content": "Fernando Cod\u00e1 dos Santos Cavalcanti Marques (born 8 October 1979) is a Brazilian mathematician working mainly in geometry, topology, partial differential equations and Morse theory. He is a professor at Princeton University. In 2012, together with Andr\u00e9 Neves, he proved the Willmore conjecture.\n Fernando Cod\u00e1 Marques was born on 8 October 1979 in S\u00e3o Carlos and grew up in Macei\u00f3. His parents were both professors of engineering.[1][2]\n Cod\u00e1 Marques started as a student of civil engineering at the Federal University of Alagoas in 1996, but switched to mathematics after two years.[3][4]\n He obtained a master's degree from the Instituto Nacional de Matem\u00e1tica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) in 1999. Among his teachers at the IMPA were Manfredo do Carmo and Elon Lages Lima.[5]\n Following the advice of Manfredo do Carmo, Cod\u00e1 Marques went to Cornell University to learn geometric analysis from Jos\u00e9 F. Escobar, so that he could return and bring this area of research to Brazil. While still in Brazil, Cod\u00e1 Marques had been informed that Escobar was facing cancer and that he could maybe die before Cod\u00e1 Marques could complete his Ph.D with him. Despite this information, Cod\u00e1 Marques decided to keep the arrangement and became his student.[6]\n In 2001, Cod\u00e1 Marques was awarded Cornell's Battig Prize for graduate students, for \"excellence and promise in mathematics\".[7] He obtained his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 2003, under the supervision of Jos\u00e9 F. Escobar (thesis: Existence and Compactness Theorems on Conformal Deformation of Metrics).[8]\n Despite the usual path being to go for a postdoctoral research, Cod\u00e1 Marques had in mind that his mission was to return to Brazil. IMPA had already offered him a position of researcher, and he accepted it. But after six months in Brazil, Escobar, who was his main connection with researchers outside of Brazil, died. Cod\u00e1 Marques faced the difficulties of doing research in isolation, so he decided to accept an invitation to stay one year as a postdoc at Stanford University. There he was influenced by Richard Schoen's school of thought in geometry and met Andr\u00e9 Neves (who would become his main collaborator), and many other of his contacts.[6]\n He worked at IMPA from 2003 to 2014.[9]\nOn September 1, 2014, Cod\u00e1 Marques joined Princeton University as a full professor.[10]\n Antoine Song was a student of his.[11]\n Some of his best known works are the following:[9][12]\n In 2009, together with Richard Schoen and Marcus Khuri he did important work on the Yamabe problem.[13][14] He solved Schoen's conjecture on compactness in the Yamabe problem for spin manifolds.\n In April 2010, in cooperation with Simon Brendle and Andr\u00e9 Neves,[15] Marques provided a counter-example to the rigidity conjecture of Min-Oo.\n Cod\u00e1 Marques and Neves \"Min-max theory and the Willmore conjecture\" was uploaded to arXiv on February 2012, in it they solved the Willmore conjecture, using Almgren\u2013Pitts min-max theory, which was then \"a relatively old tool and already somewhat out of favor\". According to Harold Rosenberg, using this tool was possible because the pair discovered a connection between objects that were apparently very different: \"connecting the problem with questions about minimal surfaces on the sphere [...] a priori there would be no reason for these things to be connected. It's curious, very curious.\",[6][16] the solution to the Willmore conjecture[17] (Willmore, 1965)\n In May 2012, in cooperation with Ian Agol and Andr\u00e9 Neves,[18] Marques provided the solution to the Freedman\u2013He\u2013Wang conjecture (Freedman\u2013He\u2013Wang, 1994)\n In December 2017, in cooperation with Kei Irie and Andr\u00e9 Neves, he solved Yau's conjecture (Yau, 1982) in the generic case.[19]\n Cod\u00e1 Marques and Andr\u00e9 Neves are currently working to extend Almgren\u2013Pitts min-max theory.[20]\n He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) of 2010 in Hyderabad (on \"Scalar curvature, conformal geometry, and the Ricci flow with surgery\"),[21] and a plenary speaker at the ICM of 2014 in Seoul (on \"Minimal surfaces \u2013 variational theory and applications\").[22]\n He received the TWAS Prize in 2012.[23]\n He was awarded the ICTP Ramanujan Prize in 2012.[17][24]\n In 2014 he gave the \u0141ojasiewicz Lecture (on \"The min-max theory of minimal surfaces and applications\") at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w.[25]\n He is a full member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences since 2014.[1]\n He shared the 2016 Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry with Andr\u00e9 Neves.[9][26]\n He was elected to the 2018 class of fellows of the American Mathematical Society.[27]\n He is a Distinguished Visiting Professor of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Studies.[28]\n He sits on the Editorial Board of the journal Annals of Mathematics.[29]\n In 2020 he received a Simons Investigator Award.[30] The citation reads: \"His recent work, in collaboration with Andr\u00e9 Neves, developed a full Morse theory for the area functional in closed Riemannian manifolds. The ideas introduced by them have revitalized the subject, leading to the discovery that closed minimal surfaces are ubiquitous in these spaces.\"\n He is married to mathematician Ana Maria Menezes de Jesus. She was a student of Harold Rosenberg at IMPA, and is currently an instructor of mathematics at Princeton University.[31][32] Cod\u00e1 Marques and Menezes have a son named Pedro and a daughter named Luisa.[33][34]\n ", "tags": ["21st-century Brazilian mathematicians", "1979 births", "Living people", "Cornell University alumni", "Princeton University faculty", "Differential geometers", "Members of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences", "People from S\u00e3o Carlos", "PDE theorists", "Topologists", "Instituto Nacional de Matem\u00e1tica Pura e Aplicada alumni", "Instituto Nacional de Matem\u00e1tica Pura e Aplicada researchers", "Brazilian expatriate academics in the United States", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "TWAS laureates", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "CS1 Portuguese-language sources (pt)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Articles to be expanded from February 2018", "All articles to be expanded", "Articles using small message boxes", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers"], "raw": "Fernando Cod\u00e1 MarquesBorn (1979-10-08) October 8, 1979 (age\u00a041)S\u00e3o Carlos, BrazilNationalityBrazilianAlma\u00a0materCornell University (Ph.D.)IMPA (M.S.)UFAL (B.S.)Known\u00a0forWillmore conjectureFreedman\u2013He\u2013Wang conjectureMin-Oo conjectureYau's conjectureContributions to Almgren\u2013Pitts min-max theoryYamabe problemSpouse(s)Ana Maria MenezesAwardsVeblen Prize in Geometry (2016)ICTP Ramanujan Prize (2012)TWAS Prize (2012)Scientific careerFieldsMathematics: geometric analysis, geometric topologyInstitutionsPrinceton UniversityIMPAThesisExistence and Compactness Theorems on Conformal Deformation of Metrics\u00a0(2003)Doctoral advisorJos\u00e9 F.
