{"name": "Rebeca Guber", "content": "\n Rebeca Cherep de Guber (2 July 1926 \u2013 25 August 2020) was an Argentine mathematician, university professor, textbook author and 1960s pioneer in the development of computer science in Argentina.[1][2]\n Rebeca Cherep was born in Avellaneda, which is a suburb of the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. She completed her undergraduate studies at the National University of La Plata, earned her PhD in mathematics, and taught at the Faculties of Exact and Natural Sciences and Engineering at the University of Buenos Aires.[3]\n She married Jos\u00e9 Guber, an engineer, and they had at least one child, Rosana Guber.[4]\n In 1960 she was part of the group of scientists and teachers who created the Argentine Calculation Society, under the direction of Manuel Sadosky, with whom, years before, she had written the textbook, Elements of Differential and Integral Calculus.[5] In the years since its first publication, the text has been widely disseminated among advanced students of science and engineering, and republished many times.[6]\n \nThe Calculation Institute (IC) of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences was created around 1959.[7] Rebeca Guber took over as Technical Secretary on June 6, 1960. A few months later, the computer named Clementina, (which was installed in 18 metal cabinets stretching 18 metres (59\u00a0ft) long[8]) became known as the first computer installed for scientific research in Argentina and began its operations at the IC.[5] About her work there, Guber has recalled: \"After 1955, Manuel [Sadosky] became a professor of the Analysis I course and I was his head of practical work. When the Calculation Institute was created, Manuel called me to be his chief of operations. It was a very busy and rewarding time. Manuel outlined the policies and I made sure that everything went as planned. He had to handle a group of seventy people.\"  Guber's work proved to be fundamental in the entire process of installation and development of the famous Clementina.[3]\n Rebeca Guber, along with her colleague and friend Cecilia Berdichevsky, are only two of the female mathematicians who were fundamental to the success of the early development of information science in Argentina.[3]\n In 1966, with Argentina's coup d'etat that removed the president from power and culminated in the Night of the Long Batons, scientists and researchers massively resigned from institutes and universities. The Calculation Institute of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences was \"practically dismantled.\" After Rebeca Guber, Juan \u00c1ngel Chamero and David Jacovkis resigned their positions there[3] and under the leadership of Manuel Sadosky, they founded a consultancy firm called Scientific Technical Advisors (ACT), in part to prevent the Institute's lines of research and work from being totally abandoned. \n After the return of Argentinian democracy and the election of president Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn at the end of 1983, Guber continued to work with Sadosky when he was named the Nation's Secretariat of Science and Technology. \n In tribute to her, in the Calculus Institute there is a room that bears her name: Rebeca Cherep de Guber Classroom.[9]\n ", "tags": ["1925 births", "2020 deaths", "University of Buenos Aires alumni", "Argentine mathematicians", "Argentine computer scientists", "People from Buenos Aires", "Computer scientists", "Women computer scientists", "Argentine women computer scientists", "CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from May 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers"], "raw": "Argentine mathematician\n\n\nRebeca Cherep de GuberBornRebeca Cherep2 July 1926Avellaneda, ArgentinaDied25 August 2020(2020-08-25) (aged\u00a094)Buenos Aires, ArgentinaNationalityArgentinianOccupationmathematician, computer scientistSpouse(s)Jos\u00e9 GuberChildrenRosana Guber\nRebeca Cherep de Guber (2 July 1926 \u2013 25 August 2020) was an Argentine mathematician, university professor, textbook author and 1960s pioneer in the development of computer science in Argentina.[1][2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Calculation Institute\n1.2 University closure\n1.3 Secretariat of Science and Technology\n1.4 Legacy\n\n\n2 Selected publications\n3 References\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nRebeca Cherep was born in Avellaneda, which is a suburb of the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
