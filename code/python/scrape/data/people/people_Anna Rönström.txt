{"name": "Anna R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m", "content": "Anna R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m (1847\u20131920), was a Swedish educator. She was a local pioneer of female education in Lund, and the founder of the secondary education school H\u00f6gre Elementarskolan i Lund (Higher Elementary School in Lund) for girls, also customarily known as R\u00f6nstr\u00f6mska skolan (R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m School).\n[1]\n \n Anna R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m was a student of the H\u00f6gre l\u00e4rarinneseminariet in Stockholm 1864\u201367, and worked as a governess in Lund before she founded her own school for girls in 1871. The school was originally referred to as R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m School (R\u00f6nstr\u00f6mska skolan) after its founder, and became the first school in Lund to provide secondary education to females in preparation for university studies. \nIn this, R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m and her school was a typical representative of other female pioneers who opened the first secondary education schools for girls in different Swedish cities, comparable to other local pioneers such as Maria Henschen in Uppsala, Maria Stenkula in Malm\u00f6 and Elsa Borg in G\u00e4vle.[1]\n[2]\n In theory, Anna R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m was a conservative anti-feminist and in fact had a conservative view of women's education. She stated that women should be education at home for a life in the home, and that a school for women should be more of a second home rather than a school and raise their students as parents their children rather than to educate them, and that the education of females should be guided by religion: this was in fact typical of the conservative view in the contemporary debate of women's education. In practice, however, the school she created was in fact radical and adjusted to the modern views of equal education of men and women: the school provided its students all the education necessary to prepare for university studies, and unlike many other girls' schools of the same kind, it also provided the same mathematics level as the secondary school for boys, and further more, it did not teach the French language, as schools for females normally did, but rather the German language, which was the language preferred in the secondary school for boys at the time. She also introduced home economics, which was a radical innovation at the time (1892). Her school was successful, granted state support in 1879 and communal support in 1882.[1]\n R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m was also an influential participator in the flickskolm\u00f6te, the annual national girls' school conferences. She introduced a teacher exchange between Denmark and Sweden in 1898, which became popular and functioned for many years. \nIn 1905, she also founded a women's teachers seminary with Anna Heurlin, which was incorporated in her school. \nShe is described as a skillful mathematician and became a member of the International Congress of Mathematicians  at the meeting held at Rome in 1908.[1]\n[3]\n The fate of her school was also typical: in 1933, it was united with its prime rival, the Lunds fullst\u00e4ndiga l\u00e4roverk f\u00f6r flickor from 1880, to form  Lunds kommunala flickskola ('Lund Communal Girl's School'), which was in turn later made a co-educational school.\n[4]\n She was awarded the  Swedish  royal  medal Illis Quorum Meruere Labores (commonly known as Illis quorum) in 1913.[5]\n ", "tags": ["1847 births", "1920 deaths", "19th-century Swedish educators", "20th-century Swedish educators", "Swedish mathematicians", "Women mathematicians", "19th-century Swedish mathematicians", "CS1 Swedish-language sources (sv)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Swedish educator\nAnna R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m (1847\u20131920), was a Swedish educator.
