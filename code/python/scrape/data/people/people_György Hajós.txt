{"name": "Gy\u00f6rgy Haj\u00f3s", "content": "Gy\u00f6rgy Haj\u00f3s (February 21, 1912, Budapest \u2013 March 17, 1972, Budapest) was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in group theory, graph theory, and geometry.[1][2]\n Haj\u00f3s was born February 21, 1912, in Budapest; his great-grandfather, Adam Clark, was the famous Scottish engineer who built the Chain Bridge in Budapest. He earned a teaching degree from the University of Budapest in 1935. He then took a position at the Technical University of Budapest, where he stayed from 1935 to 1949. While at the Technical University of Budapest, he earned a doctorate in 1938. He became a professor at the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in 1949 and remained there until his death in 1972.  Additionally he was president of the J\u00e1nos Bolyai Mathematical Society from 1963 to 1972.[1][2]\n Haj\u00f3s's theorem is named after Haj\u00f3s, and concerns factorizations of Abelian groups into Cartesian products of subsets of their elements.[3] This result in group theory has consequences also in geometry: Haj\u00f3s used it to prove a conjecture of Hermann Minkowski that, if a Euclidean space of any dimension is tiled by hypercubes whose positions form a lattice, then some pair of hypercubes must meet face-to-face. Haj\u00f3s used similar group-theoretic methods to attack Keller's conjecture on whether cube tilings (without the lattice constraint) must have pairs of cubes that meet face to face; his work formed an important step in the eventual disproof of this conjecture.[4]\n Haj\u00f3s's conjecture is a conjecture made by Haj\u00f3s that every graph with chromatic number k contains a subdivision of a complete graph Kk. However, it is now known to be false: in 1979, Paul A. Catlin found a counterexample for k = 8,[5] and Paul Erd\u0151s and Siemion Fajtlowicz later observed that it fails badly for random graphs.[6] The Haj\u00f3s construction is a general method for constructing graphs with a given chromatic number, also due to Haj\u00f3s.[7]\n Haj\u00f3s was a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, first as a corresponding member beginning in 1948 and then as a full member in 1958. In 1965 he was elected to the Romanian Academy of Sciences, and in 1967 to the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. He won the Gyula K\u00f6nig Prize in 1942, and the Kossuth Prize in 1951 and again in 1962.[1][2]\n ", "tags": ["Hungarian people of Scottish descent", "Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "Geometers", "Algebraists", "1912 births", "1972 deaths", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian mathematician\nThe native form of this personal name is Haj\u00f3s Gy\u00f6rgy.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nGy\u00f6rgy Haj\u00f3sGy\u00f6rgy Haj\u00f3sBorn(1912-02-21)21 February 1912Budapest, Austria-HungaryDied(1972-03-17)17 March 1972Budapest, HungaryNationalityHungarianCitizenshipHungarianScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of Budapest, Budapest Technical University of Budapest, Budapest\n\nGy\u00f6rgy Haj\u00f3s (February 21, 1912, Budapest \u2013 March 17, 1972, Budapest) was a Hungarian mathematician who worked in group theory, graph theory, and geometry.[1][2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Research\n3 Awards and honors\n4 References\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nHaj\u00f3s was born February 21, 1912, in Budapest; his great-grandfather, Adam Clark, was the famous Scottish engineer who built the Chain Bridge in Budapest.
