Keaton was awarded a Career Achievement Award from the Hollywood Film Festival.[1]\n On January 18, 2016, he was named Officer of Order of Arts and Letters in France.[2] He is also a visiting scholar at Carnegie Mellon University.[3]\n Michael John Douglas, the youngest of seven children, was born at Ohio Valley Hospital in Kennedy Township, Pennsylvania,[4] on September 5, 1951.[5] He was raised between McKees Rocks,[6] Coraopolis and Robinson Township, Pennsylvania.[7][8] His father, George A. Douglas, worked as a civil engineer and surveyor, and his mother, Leona Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Loftus), a homemaker, came from McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania.[5][9] Keaton was raised in a Catholic family,[10] and is of half Irish descent through his mother.[10][11][12] His father was of English, German, Scottish and Scotch-Irish ancestry, and was originally from a Protestant family.[13][14][15] Keaton attended Montour High School in Robinson Township, Pennsylvania,[16] and studied speech for two years at Kent State University, where he appeared in plays, and returned to Pennsylvania to pursue his career.[17]\n Keaton first appeared on TV in the Pittsburgh public television programs Where the Heart Is and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (1975). For  Mister Rogers he played one of the \"Flying Zookeeni Brothers\"[18] and served as a full-time production assistant.[19] (In 2004, after Fred Rogers' death, Keaton hosted a PBS memorial tribute, Fred Rogers: America's Favorite Neighbor.) Keaton also worked as an actor in Pittsburgh theatre; he played the role of Rick in the Pittsburgh premiere of David Rabe's Sticks and Bones with the Pittsburgh Poor Players.[20] He also performed stand-up comedy during his early years in order to supplement his income.[21]\n Keaton left Pittsburgh and moved to Los Angeles to begin auditioning for various TV parts. He popped up in various popular TV shows including Maude and The Mary Tyler Moore Hour. He decided to use a stage name to satisfy SAG rules, as there was already an actor (Michael Douglas) and daytime host (Mike Douglas) with the same or similar names.  In response to questions as to whether he selected his new surname due to an attraction to actress Diane Keaton, or in homage to silent film actor Buster Keaton, he has responded by saying \"it had nothing to do with that.\"[22][23]  Keaton has said in several interviews that he searched a phone book under \"K,\" saw \"Keaton\" and decided to stop looking.[24] Keaton's film debut came in a small non-speaking role in the Joan Rivers film Rabbit Test.\n His next big break was working alongside Jim Belushi in the short-lived comedy series Working Stiffs, which showcased his comedic talent and led to a co-starring role in the comedy Night Shift directed by Ron Howard. This was his breakout role as the fast-talking schemer Bill \"Blaze\" Blazejowski earned Keaton some critical acclaim.\n Night Shift led to Keaton becoming a leading man  in the landmark comedy hit Mr. Mom, which was met with universal acclaim. Keaton was pigeonholed as a comic lead during this time with films like Johnny Dangerously, Gung Ho, The Squeeze, The Dream Team, though Keaton tried to transition to dramatic leads as early as 1984, playing a hockey player in Touch and Go, which was shelved until 1986. Woody Allen cast Keaton as the lead in The Purple Rose of Cairo the following year, but after filming began Allen felt Keaton was \"too modern\" and reshot his scenes with Jeff Daniels in the final film, further delaying his transition to drama in the public eye. When Touch and Go was finally released in 1986 the studio was still unsure of how to market the film, making the poster similar to Mr. Mom, which resulted in failure at the box office.\n 1988 was the seminal year in Keaton's career where landed two major unconventional roles, forever changing his image to audiences.

It was only after he was introduced to Frank Miller's comic book miniseries, The Dark Knight Returns, that Keaton really understood the dark and brooding side of Batman that he portrayed to much fan approval.[30] Keaton later reprised the role for the sequel Batman Returns (1992), which was another critically acclaimed success.[31] He was initially set to reprise the role again for a third Batman film, even going as far as to show up for costume fitting. However, when Burton was dropped as director of the film, Keaton left the franchise as well. He was reportedly dissatisfied with the screenplay approved by the new director, Joel Schumacher. According to the A&E Biography episode on Keaton, after he had refused the first time (after meetings with Schumacher), Warner Bros. offered him $15 million, but Keaton steadfastly refused and was replaced by Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995).[32]\n Keaton remained active during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films, including Pacific Heights, One Good Cop, My Life and the star-studded Shakespearean story Much Ado About Nothing.

While he continued to receive good notices from the critics (particularly for Jackie Brown), he was not able to re-approach the box-office success of Batman until the release of Disney/Pixar's Cars (2006), in which he voiced Chick Hicks, a green race car with a mustache, who frequently loses his patience with losing to his longtime rival, Strip Weathers, a.k.a The King, voiced by Richard Petty. On New Year's Day of 2004, he hosted the PBS TV special Mr. Rogers: America's Favorite Neighbor. It was released by Triumph Marketing LLC on DVD September 28, 2004.

They had one son, Sean, in 1983. He had a relationship with actress Courteney Cox from 1989 to 1995. Keaton, a longtime Pittsburgh resident and fan of its sports teams, negotiated a break in his Batman movie contract in case the Pittsburgh Pirates made the playoffs that year, although they ultimately did not. He also wrote an ESPN blog on the Pirates during the final months of their 2013 season.[53]\nIn the 1980s, Keaton bought a ranch near Big Timber, Montana, where he spends much of his time.[54] An avid fisherman, he is often seen on the saltwater fishing series Buccaneers & Bones on Outdoor Channel, along with Tom Brokaw, Zach Gilford, Thomas McGuane and Yvon Chouinard, among others.[55]\nKeaton endorsed Hillary Clinton for President in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,[56] and Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[57]\nIn 2019, he appeared in a PETA ad campaign, asking tourists not to visit operations that exploit animals, such as roadside zoos which sometimes offer the opportunity to get selfies with wild animals.[58]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n\n1978\n\nRabbit Test\n\nSailor\n\n\n\n\nA Different Approach\n\nFilmmaker\n\nShort film\n\n\n1982\n\nNight Shift\n\nBill Blazejowski\n\n\n\n\n1983\n\nMr. Mom\n\nJack Butler\n\n\n\n\n1984\n\nJohnny Dangerously\n\nJohnny Kelly / Johnny Dangerously\n\n\n\n\n1986\n\nGung Ho\n\nHunt Stevenson\n\n\n\n\nTouch and Go\n\nRobert \"Bobby\" Barbato\n\n\n\n\n1987\n\nThe Squeeze\n\nHarold \"Harry\" Berg\n\n\n\n\n1988\n\nShe's Having a Baby\n\nHimself\n\nUncredited cameo\n\n\nBeetlejuice\n\nBetelgeuse\n\n\n\n\nClean and Sober\n\nDaryl Poynter\n\n\n\n\n1989\n\nThe Dream Team\n\nWilliam \"Billy\" Caufield\n\n\n\n\nBatman\n\nBruce Wayne / Batman\n\n\n\n\n1990\n\nPacific Heights\n\nCarter Hayes / James Danforth\n\n\n\n\n1991\n\nOne Good Cop\n\nArthur \"Artie\" Lewis\n\n\n\n\n1992\n\nBatman Returns\n\nBruce Wayne / Batman\n\n\n\n\n1993\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing\n\nDogberry\n\n\n\n\nMy Life\n\nRobert \"Bob\" Ivanovich\n\n\n\n\n1994\n\nThe Paper\n\nHenry Hackett\n\n\n\n\nSpeechless\n\nKevin Vallick\n\n\n\n\n1996\n\nMultiplicity\n\nDoug Kinney\n\n\n\n\n1997\n\nInventing the Abbotts\n\nNarrator / Older Doug Holt\n\nUncredited\n\n\nJackie Brown\n\nRaymond \"Ray\" Nicolette\n\n\n\n\n1998\n\nDesperate Measures\n\nPeter J.
