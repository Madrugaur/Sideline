{"name": "Charles Adler Jr.", "content": "Charles Adler Jr. (June 20, 1899 \u2013 October 23, 1980) was an American inventor and engineer. He is most known for developing devices meant to improve transportation safety, including sonically actuated traffic lights, colorblind road signals, pedestrian push-buttons, and flashing aircraft lights.\n Adler was born to a wealthy family in Baltimore, Maryland. As a child he exhibited a vivid imagination. For this reason, Adler\u2019s father encouraged him to pursue inventing.\n At age 14, he developed his first documented invention\u2014an automobile brake\u2014which he received a patent for 5 years later.\n After high school, Adler attended Johns Hopkins University to study engineering, but after continuing to struggle with academics, he dropped out 2 years later. He served briefly in the US Army training corps as an acting corporal during World War I until December 1918.[1]\n In 1919, Adler began working for the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad (also known as the Ma&Pa) as a telegrapher and assistant station agent. There, he began developing safety and signaling devices, where he was later asked by railroad president OH Nance to look into fixing the failing electric warning signals at railroad crossings. In response, Adler designed a system that contained a warning light connected in parallel to the standard bells. This ensured that even if the bells failed, the light would turn on and alert the driver to an oncoming train.\n After the success of this system, Adler was promoted within the company to signal engineer and was given resources for his own experiments and research.\n For his first solo project, he set out to design a new flashing signal for grade crossings. In his design, he created an automatically triggered system that flashed two lights alternatively in a wigwag pattern when a train was approaching. This invention, called the Adler Flashing Relay, received the American Railway Association\u2019s endorsement and was later adopted by over 40 railroad companies.\n After the success of his projects, Adler left the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad to pursue invention full-time. However, he remained a signal consultant for the company until 1957.[2]\n During his time at Ma&Pa, Adler kept a journal of potential invention ideas for a later date. One of such ideas\u2014the automatic speed-control system\u2014became the focus of his career in the 1920s. He conceived the idea for this automobile safety feature on October 1, 1924 and had a working prototype by December 1925.\n Adler\u2019s speed control system was based on the idea of car speed governors, but he believed they should only be activated at particularly dangerous spots on the road. Adler\u2019s system was composed of a series of bar magnets buried under the road 20 meters away from dangerous spots. At speeds over 24\u00a0km/h, this magnet activated a series of relays installed in the car which cut the car\u2019s ignition. Once the car had passed over a similar second magnet, the ignition was restored, and the car would be able to accelerate like normal.\n Rather than manufacturing the invention himself, Adler decided to publicize his work in hopes of finding a company to license it. He sold the idea to Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and received positive reactions from other buyers. Adler contacted 600 newspapers, magazines, and engineering journals, including Science Monthly and the New York Evening Post, to run stories on his system. However, on December 15, 1926 his financial investors suspended work until they could guarantee the support of the national government.[1]\n In the 1920s Adler worked on developing the sonically actuated traffic light. To operate it, drivers pulled up to a red light and honked their horns to make the light change. The system, designed for use on intersections between lightly traveled and major roads, was first installed by Baltimore on February 22, 1928 at the intersection of Falls Road and then-Belvedere Avenue (now Northern Parkway) and still stands today. Further production of this design was picked up by General Electric, but Adler\u2019s traffic signal was beat out by another invention. This was the first actuated traffic signal in the US and served as the basis for modern traffic signals.[1]\n On February 4, 1929 Adler installed a pedestrian push button at the intersection of Charles Street and Cold Spring Lane in Baltimore. It was the first pedestrian-actuated signal.\n By the end of the 1930s, Adler\u2019s work on traffic safety came to an end. After getting his pilot\u2019s license and nearly colliding with another plane, he decided to pursue improvements in aviation safety. He patented an external lighting system for airplanes to help pilots better see each other at night. This patent, along with 9 of his other inventions, were transferred by Adler to the US government in the name of safety.[3]\n In 1930 Adler worked on a traffic signal based on different shapes for colorblind drivers.[2]\n In 1933, Adler\u2019s double-filament lamp was installed on the Pennsylvania Central Railroad. The ability of the bulb to function at half-capacity, even when burnt out, was beneficial in keeping railroad crossing lights functioning for long periods of time. The system remained part of the Pennsylvania Central Railroad until the 1970s.[2]\n Adler continued his work in transportation safety, serving on various transportation boards and advising the government on a number of safety issues. As a member of Maryland\u2019s Traffic Safety Commission during 1952\u20131980, Adler made recommendations that later resulted in the formation of a federal department of government focused on traffic safety. Adler also established his own foundation in 1956 to help inventors in the field of safety.\n In 1961, Adler was appointed to the board of directors of Friendship International Airport (now BWI Marshall) and organized the connection of the airport to the city by rail to reduce traffic. The resulting BWI Rail Station opened in 1980; Adler died hours before the station's dedication, where he was scheduled to be honored.[2]\n Adler left behind many inventions that were the first of their kind. He is credited with over sixty patented inventions in the field of vehicular safety, some of which he transferred to the government.\n His motto was \u201cIf they can save lives, I want everyone to have them.\u201d Adler often donated his patents to the government free of charge so that they could be publicly used and help more people.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1899 births", "1980 deaths", "Engineers from Maryland", "Transport engineers", "People from Baltimore", "Johns Hopkins University alumni", "Smithsonian Institution people", "20th-century American engineers", "20th-century American inventors", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Use mdy dates from November 2016"], "raw": "American engineer (1899-1980)\nCharles Adler Jr.Born(1899-06-20)June 20, 1899DiedOctober 23, 1980(1980-10-23) (aged\u00a081)Alma\u00a0materJohns Hopkins UniversityOccupationInventor, EngineerKnown\u00a0forTransportation Safety\nCharles Adler Jr. (June 20, 1899 \u2013 October 23, 1980) was an American inventor and engineer.
