{"name": "Gregory Chaitin", "content": "\n Gregory John Chaitin (/\u02c8t\u0283a\u026at\u026an/ CHY-tin; born 25 June 1947)  is an Argentine-American mathematician and computer scientist. Beginning in the late 1960s, Chaitin made contributions to algorithmic information theory and metamathematics, in particular a computer-theoretic result equivalent to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem.[2] He is considered to be one of the founders of what is today known as algorithmic (Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin, Kolmogorov or program-size) complexity together with Andrei Kolmogorov and Ray Solomonoff. Along with the works of e.g. Solomonoff, Kolmogorov, Martin-L\u00f6f, and Leonid Levin, algorithmic information theory became a foundational part of theoretical computer science, information theory, and mathematical logic.[3][4] It is a common subject in several computer science curricula. Besides computer scientists, Chaitin's work draws attention of many philosophers and mathematicians to fundamental problems in mathematical creativity and digital philosophy.\n He attended the Bronx High School of Science and City College of New York, where he (still in his teens) developed the theory that led to his independent discovery of algorithmic complexity.[5][6]\n Chaitin has defined Chaitin's constant \u03a9, a real number whose digits are equidistributed and which is sometimes informally described as an expression of the probability that a random program will halt. \u03a9 has the mathematical property that it is definable, with asymptotic approximations from below (but not from above), but not computable.\n Chaitin is also the originator of using graph coloring to do register allocation in compiling, a process known as Chaitin's algorithm.[7]\n He was formerly a researcher at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York and remains an emeritus researcher. He has written more than 10 books that have been translated to about 15 languages. He is today interested in questions of metabiology and information-theoretic formalizations of the theory of evolution.\n Chaitin also writes about philosophy, especially metaphysics and philosophy of mathematics (particularly about epistemological matters in mathematics). In metaphysics, Chaitin claims that algorithmic information theory is the key to solving problems in the field of biology (obtaining a formal definition of 'life', its origin and evolution) and neuroscience (the problem of consciousness and the study of the mind).\n In recent writings, he defends a position known as digital philosophy. In the epistemology of mathematics, he claims that his findings in mathematical logic and algorithmic information theory show there are \"mathematical facts that are true for no reason, that are true by accident\".[8] Chaitin proposes that mathematicians must abandon any hope of proving those mathematical facts and adopt a quasi-empirical methodology.\n In 1995 he was given the degree of doctor of science honoris causa by the University of Maine. In 2002 he was given the title of honorary professor by the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina, where his parents were born and where Chaitin spent part of his youth. In 2007 he was given a Leibniz Medal[9] by Wolfram Research. In 2009 he was given the degree of doctor of philosophy honoris causa by the National University of C\u00f3rdoba. He was formerly a researcher at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center and is now a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.\n Some philosophers and logicians disagree with the philosophical conclusions that Chaitin has drawn from his theorems related to what Chaitin thinks is a kind of fundamental arithmetic randomness.[10]\nThe logician Torkel Franz\u00e9n criticized Chaitin's interpretation of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem and the alleged explanation for it that Chaitin's work represents.[11]\n ", "tags": ["1947 births", "Living people", "The Bronx High School of Science alumni", "City College of New York alumni", "Argentine mathematicians", "Argentine computer scientists", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American information theorists", "IBM employees", "Philosophers of mathematics", "Epistemologists", "Metaphysics writers", "American logicians", "21st-century American philosophers", "Argentine information theorists", "Mathematicians from New York (state)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from September 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Articles needing POV-check from July 2016", "All NPOV disputes", "CS1 Italian-language sources (it)", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Argentine-American mathematician\n\n\nGregory ChaitinBorn (1947-06-25) 25 June 1947 (age\u00a073)Chicago[1]NationalityArgentine-AmericanKnown\u00a0forChaitin\u2013Kolmogorov complexityChaitin's constantChaitin's algorithmScientific careerFieldsBiologyMathematicsComputer scienceInstitutionsFederal University of Rio de JaneiroIBM Thomas J.
