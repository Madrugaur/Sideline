It offers a classification of polytopes and derives Fedorov polytopes, congruent polytopes that can completely fill space.\nHe wrote the classic The Symmetry of Regular Systems of Figures in 1891,[9] which contained the first cataloging of the 230 space groups. The same year the equivalent results were presented by German mathematician Sch\u00f6nflies. Fedorov and Sch\u00f6nflies had been intensively discussing the subject during their work, so the results can be somehow considered as joint ones, though Sch\u00f6nflies noted Fedorov's priority for some major ideas.\nHe published his classic work The Theodolite Method in Mineralogy and Petrography in 1893.[10]\nIn 1906 he published Perfektsionizm (Perfectionism), a work he had started in the late 1870s. From a materialistic starting point he argued  that natural conditions are themselves conditions of eternal change. He attacked authors claim that there is  stability and equilibrium in nature. Contrariwise he claimed that evolution is quality of living creatures rather than a tendency toward a \"higher order\" of stability, and equilibrium of organisms. He criticised Herbert Spencer's views arguing that such views when applied to the evolution of natural history focus attention on the least changeable. However, he argued that such views systematically failed to take into account the fact that equilibrium is attained only at the moment of death: for a living creature, changing forms are constantly developing. Thus Fyodorov criticised the notion that the constant and the stable are the supreme mission of life. Rather he claimed that life never finally achieves anything but always strives to achieve. For him this is where the true philosophy of nature is to be found.[11]\nTsarstvo kristallov (Crystal Kingdom) was first published posthumously in 1920 and featured much of the work carried out by Fyodorov and his colleagues. during the previous of forty years. Here he noted that sciences which have been fully developed not only satisfy the spiritual needs of part of mankind but also provide great power to direct the active forces of nature for man\u2019s use.[11]\nLegacy[edit]\n Evgraf Fjodorow Strasse\nThere is a street named after him on the site of the international X-ray laser research facility European XFEL in Schenefeld near Hamburg.\n\nSee also[edit]\nGroup theory\nList of Russian material scientists\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ I.
