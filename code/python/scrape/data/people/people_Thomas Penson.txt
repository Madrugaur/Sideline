{"name": "Thomas Penson", "content": "\n Thomas Penson, or Thomas Penson the younger (c. 1790 \u2013 1859) was the county surveyor of Denbighshire and Montgomeryshire. An innovative architect and designer of a number of masonry arch bridges over the River Severn and elsewhere. He was the son of Thomas Penson the older, (c. 1760 \u2013 1824), who had been the county surveyor for Flintshire from 1810 to 1814, but had been dismissed when the bridge at Overton-on-Dee collapsed.[1] Thomas Penson the younger, completed its replacement. Thomas Penson the younger had two sons: Thomas Mainwaring Penson (died 1864) and Richard Kyrke Penson (died 1886), both of whom were architects and both practised in Chester[2][3]\n \nThomas Penson the younger, was a pupil of the architect and bridge designer Thomas Harrison of Chester. He became a fellow of the RIBA in 1848 and an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1839.[4] He was appointed Montgomeryshire County Surveyor in 1817, a post in which he continued until 1859.  He was also the surveyor for the Montgomeryshire Turnpike Trusts and was responsible for the design of many new roads in the county.[5] He became county surveyor for Denbighshire around 1820. He had married Frances Kirk, daughter of the Wrexham iron master Richard Kirk (1747\u20131839) in 1814, and initially lived at Overton-on-Dee, but by 1823 he had moved to Oswestry, where he set up his office, known as \"Penson's Chambers\" at 35 Willow Street; while he lived at 19 Willow Street. In 1839 his wife inherited from her father Gwersyllt Hall or Hill near Wrexham, which Penson re-modeled in Neo-Jacobean style, which they then used as their main residence.[6] Among Penson's pupils was J W Poundley, who was to become the Montgomeryshire County Surveyor 1861: and the Welsh poet John Jones (Talhaiarn). Penson was Mayor of Oswestry in 1840 and was appointed Deputy Lord Lieutenant for Denbighshire in 1852.  Thomas Penson died at Gwersyllt on 20 May 1859.[7]\n Penson's work as a bridge builder in Montgomeryshire has been surveyed in detail by C R Anthony[8] Anthony lists 62 bridges built to Penson's designs in Montgomeryshire.\nHe relied on contractors to build his bridges, such as David Davies, who built the approach roads to Llandinam Bridge in 1846.[9][10]\nIn February 1852, the Severn flooded, damaging a number of bridges for which Penson went on to design replacements.\nPenson designed a two-span cast iron arch bridge at Caerhowel in 1858 to replace a timber structure destroyed by floods. Against his advice, a suspension bridge designed by James Dredge had been built in 1854, only to collapse four years later under the weight of three lime wagons, killing one man.\nOther bridges credited to Thomas Penson include:\n Long Bridge, Newtown By Thomas Penson\n Caerhowel Bridge over the Severn at Brynderwen, Abermule. By Thomas Penson 1858\n Sontley Bridge near Wrexham Inscription Thos Person: County Surveyor;  Jones Ruabon :Foundry 1843\n Longbridge, Llanidloes Thomas Penson, 1826\n Although a pupil of Thomas Harrison, noted for his use of the Classical and particularly \"Grecian\" architectural style, this is rarely adopted by Penson. An exception is the once impressive Flannel Market (now Regent Centre) of 1832 at Newtown. For Country Houses he favoured a Neo-Jacobean style; as at Vaynor, Llanrhaidr Hall and Hill House, Gwersysllt,. He also used this style for the Butcher's Market at Wrexham. For churches he adopted an assertive and non-archaeological version of French Romanesque, although St Davids, Newtown, built in brick and terracotta, is also influenced by the North German Brick Gothic. More particularly he seems to be copying Saint Salvator's Cathedral in Bruges, with buff (rather than the normal red) bricks and has pyramid capping on the pinnacles. Saint Salvator's tower had been remodelled by Robert Dennis Chantrell following a fire in 1838, and this may provide a connection with Penson[12] The design is probably also influenced by Pugin's Roman Catholic St Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham, which is a slightly earlier example of Brick Gothic revival.  It is Penson's innovative use of terracotta at Christ Church, Welshpool that is of particular interest. Christ Church (1839\u201344) was commissioned by the Earl of Powis and is possibly the earliest example of the terracotta revival in Britain.  In this church moulded brownish yellow bricks and terracotta were used for the Romanesque arches of the nave and for the apsidal vaulting of the chancel ceiling[13]\n Penson was an early and leading exponent of Romanesque Revival architecture and he developed a distinctive style based on the French Romanesque and the earlier Romanesque of the German and Flemish Brick Gothic. Penson built at least six churches in this style. Romanesque Revival architecture had been introduced in Wales by Thomas Hopper\u2019s \u2018\u2018Neo-Norman\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2019Norman revival\u2019\u2019 designs for Penrhyn Castle, which were executed between 1822-37.,[14] The style of Romanesque adopted by Penson contrasts with the Italianate Romanesque of other architects such as Thomas Henry Wyatt, who designed Saint Mary and Saint Nicholas Church, Wilton in this style at Wilton which was built between 1841 and 1844 for the Dowager Countess of Pembroke and her son, Lord Herbert of Lea.[15]\n The source for Penson\u2019s terracotta appears to have been the brickworks associated with the Oswestry  coalfield between Trefonen and Morda which were to come into the ownership of the railway engineer Thomas Savin. Terracotta was being promoted as cheaper alternative to costly carved stonework for decorative work on churches. The terracotta was produced by casting, which was then fired. Similar designs on the columns and arches can be seen on the porch of the Llangedwyn church and Llanymynech, and these are presumably designs prepared by Penson.[16]\n Christ Church, Welshpool.

Some of these were rebuilt from earlier timber framed buildings, while others were built in a Tudor Revival style and are some of the earliest examples of Black-and-white Revival architecture. Penson\u2019s style can be recognised by the massive brick chimney stacks which have been added to the houses, the ornamental bargeboards to the gables and in some cases the black and white painting on the brick work to give the impression of timber framing.[49]\nPenson appears to be an important innovator in developing rural Tudor picturesque architecture and his son Thomas Mainwaring Penson further developed Black-and-white Revival architecture  from 1852 onwards in Chester.
