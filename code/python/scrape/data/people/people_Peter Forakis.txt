{"name": "Peter Forakis", "content": "Peter Forakis (born September 22, 1927, in Hanna, Wyoming, died November 26, 2009 in Petaluma, California)[1] was an American artist known as an abstract geometric sculptor. The son of a Greek immigrant, he grew up on the Wyoming prairie until the age of 10 when his family moved to Oakland, California. Eventually they settled in Modesto, California. Forakis was in the Merchant Marines from 1945-50. He served in the US. Military in Korea and Japan from 1951-53. He earned his B.F.A. at the California School of Fine Arts (San Francisco Art Institute) in 1957.\n In 1955 Forakis created the poster for the Six Gallery reading by Allen Ginsberg, Philip Lamantia, Michael McClure, Gary Snyder, and Philip Whalen, MCed by Kenneth Rexroth.[2] In 1958 Forakis moved to New York City. It was during this time in New York in the late 1950s-1960s that Forakis emerged as a prominent member of the art world, and, along with artists Mark di Suvero, Ed Ruda, Dean Fleming, Robert Grosvenor, Anthony Magar, Tamara Melcher, Forrest \u201cFrosty\u201d Myers, David Novros and Leo Valledor, he founded the Park Place Gallery (1963\u201367), a unique artists\u2019 co-op space.  Park Place became the prototype for experimental art spaces of the 1970s.\n Forakis was a ceaseless experimenter and was conducting his own research during the Park Place Gallery time period.  Although he began as a painter, his paintings became sculpture. His work quickly evolved in a 3-dimensional direction, with a seminal series of \u201c3D paintings\u201d (1959\u201362) consisting of brightly painted abstract constructions made from mostly found timber which literally \u201ccame off the wall.\u201d  Sadly, few of these works remain.\nForakis became fascinated by geometry and his focus became sculptural. San Francisco Chronicle Art critic Kenneth Baker credits Forakis as the \u201coriginator of geometry-based sculpture from the 60s\u201d. In an article by Joanne Dickson titled \u201cProfile: Peter Forakis\u201d in the Winter 1981 edition of Ocular Magazine Forakis said, \u201cGeometry\u2026is a natural law that exists not only in my thinking and my blood, bones, and marrow, but in the universe and all its matter.\u201d \nForakis embarked on his lifelong exploration of the cube and hypercube along with Four-Dimensional theories.  Since the late 1950s Peter Forakis has been a prolific producer of sculpture based on geometric shapes such as cubes, spheres, octahedrons and rhomboids. Some of his best known pieces include Daedules & Icarus (1963), Magic Box (1966) and Hyper Cube,1967 (Walker Art Center).\n In 1967 Forakis received his first monumental scale commission.  Atlanta Gateway, one of the largest existing works of modern sculpture anywhere measuring 100 feet by 200 feet by 100 feet of tubular steel, spans a major traffic artery in Atlanta, Georgia\u2019s Southwest Industrial Park.\n By the early 1970s Forakis had begun experimenting with his \u201cslots\u201d technique, one of his signature achievements notable both as a unique language of examining geometry and for fabricating large scale works in steel without welding. Cutting slots into steel and sliding sheets together allowed large sculptures to be assembled using only gravity and the weight of the material. Archimedes Cube, (series, beginning in 1968) a signature piece for Forakis, has no welds, only slots. Of his monumental slotted sculptures are Sokar: the Egyptian Key (1974), and Jack London (1982) owned by the Oakland Museum and located in the Oakland Estuary, Oakland, California.\n He  exhibited his work in major sculpture exhibitions in museums including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) 1967 American Sculpture of the Sixties exhibition. His work has been seen on both coasts, across the US, and in Europe and Asia.
