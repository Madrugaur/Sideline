Dickson.[4] She taught at Hastings College from 1913 to 1917 and at Northwestern University from 1917 to 1919. She then returned to her alma mater in 1921 where she was the only female regular faculty member above the rank of instructor until 1982 when Karen Uhlenbeck was appointed professor of mathematics.[3] Logsdon remained at the University of Chicago for a large portion of her career, until 1946.
