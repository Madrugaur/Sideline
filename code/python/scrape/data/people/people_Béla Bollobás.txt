{"name": "B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s", "content": "\n B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s FRS (born 3 August 1943) is a Hungarian-born British mathematician who has worked in various areas of mathematics, including functional analysis, combinatorics, graph theory, and percolation. He was strongly influenced by Paul Erd\u0151s since the age of 14.[2][6][7][8]\n As a student, he took part in the first three International Mathematical Olympiads, winning two gold medals.[9] Paul Erd\u0151s invited Bollob\u00e1s to lunch after hearing about his victories, and they kept in touch afterward. Bollob\u00e1s' first publication was a joint publication with Erd\u0151s on extremal problems in graph theory, written when he was in high school in 1962.\n With Erd\u0151s's recommendation to Harold Davenport and a long struggle for permission from the Hungarian authorities, Bollob\u00e1s was able to spend an undergraduate year in Cambridge, England. However, the authorities denied his request to return to Cambridge for doctoral study. A similar scholarship offer from Paris was also quashed. He wrote his first doctorate in discrete geometry under the supervision of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Fejes T\u00f3th and Paul Erd\u0151s in Budapest University, 1967, after which he spent a year in Moscow with Isra\u00efl Moiseevich Gelfand. After spending a year at Christ Church, Oxford, where Michael Atiyah held the Savilian Chair of Geometry, he vowed never to return to Hungary due to his disillusion with the 1956 Soviet intervention. He then went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where in 1972 he received a second PhD in functional analysis, studying Banach algebras under the supervision of Frank Adams.[4][2] In 1970, he was awarded a fellowship to the college.\n By then, I said to myself, \"If I ever manage to leave Hungary, I won't return.\"  His main area of research is combinatorics, particularly graph theory. His chief interests are in extremal graph theory and random graph theory. In 1996 he resigned his university post, but remained a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.\n Bollob\u00e1s has been a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, since 1970; in 1996 he was appointed to the Jabie Hardin Chair of Excellence at the University of Memphis, and in 2005 he was awarded a Senior Research Fellowship at Trinity College.[2]\n Bollob\u00e1s has proved results on extremal graph theory, functional analysis, the theory of random graphs, graph polynomials and percolation. For example, with Paul Erd\u0151s he proved results about the structure of dense graphs; he was the first to prove detailed results about the phase transition in the evolution of random graphs; he proved that the chromatic number of the random graph on n vertices is asymptotically n/2\u00a0log\u00a0n; with Imre Leader he proved basic discrete isoperimetric inequalities; with Richard Arratia and Gregory Sorkin he constructed the interlace polynomial; with Oliver Riordan he introduced the ribbon polynomial (now called the Bollob\u00e1s\u2013Riordan polynomial); with Andrew Thomason, J\u00f3zsef Balogh, Mikl\u00f3s Simonovits, Robert Morris and Noga Alon he studied monotone and hereditary graph properties; with Paul Smith and Andrew Uzzell he introduced and classified random cellular automata with general homogeneous monotone update rules; with J\u00f3zsef Balogh, Hugo Duminil-Copin and Robert Morris he studied bootstrap percolation; with Oliver Riordan he proved that the critical probability in random Voronoi percolation in the plane is 1/2; and with Svante Janson and Oliver Riordan he introduced a very general model of heterogeneous sparse random graphs.\n In addition to over 350 research papers on mathematics, Bollob\u00e1s  has written several books, including the research monographs Extremal Graph Theory in 1978, Random Graphs in 1985 and Percolation (with Oliver Riordan) in 2006, the introductory books Modern Graph Theory for undergraduate courses in 1979, Combinatorics and Linear Analysis in 1990, and the collection of problems The Art of Mathematics \u2013 Coffee Time in Memphis in 2006, with drawings by Gabriella Bollob\u00e1s. He has also edited a number of books, including Littlewood's Miscellany.\n Bollob\u00e1s's research students have included Keith Ball at Warwick, Graham Brightwell at LSE, Timothy Gowers (who was awarded a Fields Medal in 1998 and is Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics), Imre Leader at the University of Cambridge, Jonathan Partington at Leeds, and Charles Read at Leeds, who died in 2015.\n Bollob\u00e1s is an External Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; in 2007 he was awarded the Senior Whitehead Prize by the London Mathematical Society.[11] In 2011 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society for his major contributions to many\ndifferent areas of mathematics within the broad field of combinatorics, including random graphs, percolation, extremal graphs, set systems and isoperimetric inequalities. The citation also recognises the profound influence of his\ntextbooks in many of these areas, and his key role in establishing Britain as one of the leading countries in probabilistic and extremal combinatorics.[12] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[13]\n \nBollob\u00e1s was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2011. His nomination reads  B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s is one of the world's leading mathematicians in combinatorics. He has a huge published output, which includes major contributions to many different branches of this very large area, such as random graphs, percolation, extremal graphs and set systems, isoperimetric inequalities, and more. In addition, through his classic textbooks, he has more or less defined many of these subjects. Britain is now one of the strongest countries for probabilistic and extremal combinatorics in the world: this is almost entirely due to Bollob\u00e1s's influence.[14] In 1998 he was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin.[15] He was elected Foreign Member of the Polish Academy of Sciences in 2013 and received an Honorary Doctorate from Adam Mickiewicz University, Pozna\u0144 in 2013.  In 2016, he received the Bocskai Prize.  In 2017, he received the Sz\u00e9chenyi Prize and became a Member of the Academy of Europea.\n His father is a physician. His wife, Gabriella Bollob\u00e1s, born in Budapest, was an actress and a musician  in Hungary before moving to England to become a sculptor. She made busts of mathematicians and scientists, including Paul Erd\u0151s,  Bill Tutte, George Batchelor, John von Neumann, Paul Dirac, and Stephen Hawking, as well as a cast bronze of David Hilbert.[2]\n Bollob\u00e1s is also a sportsman, having represented the University of Oxford at modern pentathlon and the University of Cambridge at fencing.[citation needed]\n ", "tags": ["1943 births", "Living people", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "21st-century Hungarian mathematicians", "Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "Graph theorists", "Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "University of Memphis faculty", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "British people of Hungarian descent", "International Mathematical Olympiad participants", "Scientists from Budapest", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "EngvarB from July 2017", "Use dmy dates from July 2017", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2018", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nB\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1sBorn (1943-08-03) 3 August 1943 (age\u00a077)[1]Budapest, HungaryAlma\u00a0materE\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd UniversityTrinity College, CambridgeKnown\u00a0forFunctional analysiscombinatoricsExtremal graph theorypercolation theory graph polynomialsSpouse(s)Gabriella Bollob\u00e1s[2]AwardsDoctor of Science (Cantab) (1982)  Foreign Member of the Hungarian National Academy of Sciences\n(1990)Senior Whitehead Prize (2007)  Fellow of the Royal Society (2011) Inaugural Fellow of the American Mathematical Society (2012) Honorary Doctorate of the Adam Mickiewicz University (2013)  Foreign Member of the Polish Academy of Sciences (2013)  Bocskai Prize (2015)   Sz\u00e9chenyi Prize (2017)  Member of Academia Europea (2018)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsRandom graphsExtremal graph theoryInstitutionsE\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd UniversityUniversity of Cambridge University of MemphisDoctoral advisorL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Fejes T\u00f3thPaul Erd\u0151s[3]Frank Adams[4]Doctoral students\nKeith Ball[5]\nJ\u00f3zsef Balogh\nGraham Brightwell\nKeith Carne\nTom Coker\nJonathan Cutler\nTristan Denley\nReinhard Diestel\nTed Dobson\nTimothy Gowers\nKaren Gunderson\nPenny Haxell\nPeter van Hintum\nYoshiharu Kohayakawa\nImre Leader\nJonathan Lee\nShoham Letzter\nRobert Morris\nBhargav Narayanan\nJonathan Partington\nLuke Pebody\nJamie Radcliffe\nOliver Riordan\nCharles Read\nJulian Sahasrabudhe\nAlexander Scott\nPaul Smith\nHunter Spink\nAndrew Thomason\nMarius Tiba\nDominik Vu\n\nWebsiteroyalsociety.org/people/bela-bollobasdpmms.cam.ac.uk/people/bb12/\nB\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s FRS (born 3 August 1943) is a Hungarian-born British mathematician who has worked in various areas of mathematics, including functional analysis, combinatorics, graph theory, and percolation.
