{"name": "Beulah Louise Henry", "content": "Beulah Louise Henry (September 28, 1887 \u2013 February 1973[1]) was an American inventor. In the 1930s, she was given the nickname \"Lady Edison\" for her many inventions.[2][3][4] According to the Journal of the Patent Office Society, in 1937, she was known as \"America's leading feminine inventor\".[5]  Famed for being a prolific inventor, Henry patented a wide number of products and innovations designed to improve daily life. Her work was so well known and respected that, as of 1937, she had a museum exhibit dedicated to her in Osaka, Japan, which was seen as an inspiration to aspiring female Japanese inventors.[5]\n Her inventions include a bobbin-free sewing machine and a vacuum ice cream freezer. She received 49 patents and had around 110 inventions total.[2]\n She was born in Raleigh, North Carolina,[5][6] the daughter of Walter R. and Beulah Henry. She was the granddaughter of former North Carolina Governor W. W. Holden and a direct descendant of President Benjamin Harrison.[5] Like many great inventors, Beulah Louise Henry was not only a creative child, but an inquisitive one too. She enjoyed painting and music, but her favorite hobby was to point out things that she saw wrong and mention changes or innovations that could be made to improve them.[5] At nine years old, she is noted to have begun drawing sketches of inventions and by 1912, at age 25, she had her first patent, for a vacuum ice cream freezer.[7] From 1909 to 1912 she attended North Carolina Presbyterian College and Elizabeth College in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she submitted her first patents.[3]\n She moved to New York City by 1924, where she founded two companies. She worked as an inventor for the Nicholas Machine Works from 1939 to 1955. She also served as a consultant for many companies that manufactured her inventions, including the Mergenthaler Linotype Company and the International Doll Company. She lived in New York hotels, belonged to a variety of scientific societies, and never married.[3]\n While living in New York, Beulah Louise Henry established both Henry Umbrella and Parasol Company and later B.L. Henry Company.[8]\n Unique from most inventors of the time, Henry's inventions did not always follow the same theme or category. One focus Henry had in terms of inventions was quality of life improving products for women. For instance, she invented a hair curler, vanity case, and a rubber sponge soap holder. One of her more prominent inventions was a \"snap-on\" parasol, which would allow women to change their parasol's pattern to match their outfit without needing to buy an entirely new parasol.\n Beulah Louise Henry also delved into the market of children's toys by inventing a new method for stuffing dolls. As a substitute to using traditional, heavy stuffing, Henry devised a way to inflate lifelike dolls and toys with rubber tubing, which reduced the toys' weight immensely. [5]\n One of Henry's most famous inventions is the \"Double Chain Stitch Sewing Machine\", which was a speedier version of a sewing machine, which eliminated the use of a bobbin and even allowed for the use of smaller diameter threads without risk of malfunction.\n Another one of Henry's inventions, patented in 1936, was a tool that enabled the writing of multiple copies of a document on a typewriter without the use of carbon paper.\n A partial list of Henry's inventions includes:[9]\n \"If necessity is the mother of invention, then resourcefulness is the father\"[10]\n \"I invent because I cannot help it - new things just thrust themselves on me\"[5]\n Henry received recognition during her life for her many inventions, working for many different companies as an innovator in New York City, such as the Mergenthaler Linotype Company as well as International Doll Company [11]. Even though these companies often put their names on her work, she still was able to profit from these inventions and still received credit from these companies for her work on the inventions [12]. After death, Henry was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006 [13].\n \n ", "tags": ["1887 births", "1973 deaths", "American women engineers", "Women inventors", "People from North Carolina", "20th-century American inventors", "CS1 errors: dates", "CS1 errors: missing title", "CS1 errors: external links", "CS1 errors: requires URL", "CS1 errors: access-date without URL", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "American business woman and inventor\nFor the U.S. film actress (born in 1887), see Louise Henry (actress).\n \"Lady Edison\" with latest invention- an air baby doll that can be bathed.\nBeulah Louise Henry (September 28, 1887 \u2013 February 1973[1]) was an American inventor.
