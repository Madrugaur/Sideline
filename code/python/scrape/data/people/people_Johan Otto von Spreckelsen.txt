{"name": "Johan Otto von Spreckelsen", "content": "Johan Otto von Spreckelsen (4 May 1929 \u2014 16 March 1987) was a Danish architect, best known for designing the Grande Arche of La D\u00e9fense in Puteaux, near Paris. He directed the creation of several modern churches in Denmark.[1][2]\n He was born in Viborg and studied at the Viborg Katedralskole and Royal Academy of Arts in Copenhagen. He later became associate professor at the Academy and from 1978 he was professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture. He later served as director up to the time of his death.[3][4]\n He directed the creation of several modern churches in Denmark: Vangede Kirke near Copenhagen (1974), Stavnsholt Kirke at the city of Farum (1981) and two Roman Catholic churches including one in Esbjerg (1969), St Nikolaj Church, and Hvidovre (1960), also consecrated to Saint Nicholas.[5]\n He was modest about his accomplishments. Once in an interview, he declared that he was an architect who built three churches and a house.[6] He relied heavily on simple geometrical figures, especially the quadrant, which can be seen in his churches, in the interior decorations even of church organs.[7]\n His design won the international competition of the Grande Arche in Puteaux, France, as the French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand felt it was the best because of its 'purity and strength'.
