{"name": "Friedensreich Hundertwasser", "content": "\n \n Friedrich Stowasser (December 15, 1928 \u2013 February 19, 2000), better known by his pseudonym Friedensreich Regentag Dunkelbunt Hundertwasser, was an Austrian visual artist[1] and architect who also worked in the field of environmental protection.\n Hundertwasser stood out as an opponent of \"a straight line\" and any standardization, expressing this concept in the field of building design. His best known work is the Hundertwasserhaus in Vienna, Austria which has become a notable place of interest in the Austrian capital, characterised by imaginative vitality and uniqueness.\n The Nazi era was a very difficult time for Hundertwasser and his mother Elsa, who were Jewish. They avoided persecution by posing as Christians, a credible ruse as Hundertwasser's father had been a Catholic. Hundertwasser was baptized as a Catholic in 1935. To remain inconspicuous, Hundertwasser also joined the Hitler Youth.[2]\n Hundertwasser developed artistic skills early on. After the war, he spent three months at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. At this time, he began to sign his art as Hundertwasser instead of Stowasser. He left to travel, using a small set of paints he carried at all times to sketch anything that caught his eye. In Florence, he met the young French painter Ren\u00e9 Br\u00f4 for the first time and they became lifelong friends. Hundertwasser's first commercial painting success was in 1952\u201353 with an exhibition in Vienna.\n His adopted surname is based on the translation of \"sto\" (the Slavic word for \"(one) hundred\") into German. The name Friedensreich has a double meaning as \"Peace-realm\" or \"Peace-rich\" (in the sense of \"peaceful\"). Therefore, his name Friedensreich Hundertwasser translates directly into English as \"Peace-Realm Hundred-Water\". The other names he chose for himself, Regentag and Dunkelbunt, translate to \"Rainy day\" and \"Darkly multi-coloured\".\n In the early 1950s, he entered the field of architecture. Hundertwasser also worked in the field of applied art, creating flags, stamps, coins, and posters. His most famous flag is his koru flag (designed in 1983), as well as several postage stamps for the Austrian Post Office. He also designed stamps for Cape Verde and for the United Nations postal administration in Geneva on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n In 1957 Hundertwasser acquired a farm on the edge of Normandy.[3] Hundertwasser married Herta Leitner in 1958 but they divorced two years later. He married again in 1962 to the Japanese artist Yuko Ikewada but she divorced him in 1966. By this time, he had gained a popular reputation for his art.\n In 1964 Hundertwasser bought \"Hahns\u00e4ge\", a former saw mill, in the sparsely populated Lower Austria's Waldviertel. There, far from the hustle and bustle and surrounded by nature, he set up a new home.[3]\n He spent some time in the 1960s in the central African Tooro Kingdom where he painted a number of works and named them after the kingdom.[4][5]\n In 1972 Hundertwasser incorporated a stock company, the \"Gr\u00fcner Janura AG\", in Switzerland; in 2008 it was renamed as \"Namida AG\". Hundertwasser managed his intellectual property rights through this company.[6][7]\n In the 1970s, Hundertwasser acquired several properties in the Bay of Islands in New Zealand, which include a total area of approximately 372 ha of the entire \"Kaurinui\" valley. There he realized his dream of living and working closely connected to nature. Beside other projects he designed the \"Bottle House\" there. He could live largely self-sufficiently using solar panels, a water wheel and a biological water purification plant. His first grass roof experiments took place there.[3]\n In 1979 Hundertwasser bought the vast historical garden Giardino Eden including the Palazzo Villa delle Rose, from Alexandra of Yugoslavia via his Swiss company.[8][9]\n In 1980, Hundertwasser visited Washington D.C. to support activist Ralph Nader's efforts to oppose nuclear proliferation. Mayor Marion Barry declared November 18 to be Hundertwasser Day as a result.[10] Hundertwasser planted trees in Judiciary Square and advocated on behalf of a co-op apartment owner who was taken to court for installing a bay window. [10]\n In 1982, Hundertwasser's only child, his daughter Heidi Trimmel, was born.[11]\n Hundertwasser was buried in New Zealand after his death at sea on the Queen Elizabeth 2 in 2000 at the age of 71.[2]\n In a letter from 1954 Hundertwasser described the square as \"geometric rectangles compressed columns on the march\".[12]\n Beginning in the 1950s Hundertwasser traveled globally promoting ecological causes.[13] In 1959 Hundertwasser got involved with helping the Dalai Lama escape from Tibet by campaigning for the Tibetan religious leader in Carl Laszlo's magazine Panderma. In later years, when he was already a known artist, Friedensreich Hundertwasser became an environmental activist and most recently operated as a more prominent opponent of the European Union, advocating the preservation of regional peculiarities.\n \nAmong the lesser-known facets of Hundertwasser's personality is his commitment to constitutional monarchy:  Austria needs something to look up to, consisting of perennial higher values\u2014of which one now hardly dares to speak\u2014such as beauty, culture, internal and external peace, faith, richness of heart [...] Austria needs an emperor, who is subservient to the people. A superior and radiant figure in whom everyone has confidence, because this great figure is a possession of all. The rationalist way of thinking has brought us, in this century, an ephemeral higher, American standard of living at the expense of nature and creation, which is now coming to an end, for it is destroying our heart, our quality of life, our longing, without which an Austrian does not want to live. It is outrageous that Austria has an emperor who did no evil to anyone but is still treated like a leper. Austria needs a crown! Long live Austria! Long live the constitutional monarchy! Long live Otto von Habsburg!- Friedensreich Hundertwasser, F\u00fcr die Wiederkehr der konstitutionellen Monarchie (For the Return of the Constitutional Monarchy).[fn 1]Kaurinui, New Zealand, 28 March 1983; dedicated, on 14 May 1987, to Otto von Habsburg for his 75th birthday. Hundertwasser's original and unruly artistic vision expressed itself in pictorial art, environmentalism, philosophy, and design of facades, postage stamps, flags, and clothing (among other areas). The common themes in his work utilised bright colours, organic forms, a reconciliation of humans with nature, and a strong individualism, rejecting straight lines.\n He remains sui generis, although his architectural work is comparable to Antoni Gaud\u00ed (1852\u20131926) in its use of biomorphic forms and the use of tile. He was also inspired by the art of the Vienna Secession, and by the Austrian painters Egon Schiele (1890\u20131918) and Gustav Klimt (1862\u20131918).\n He was fascinated by spirals, and called straight lines \"godless and immoral\" and \"something cowardly drawn with a rule, without thought or feeling\"[14] He called his theory of art \"transautomatism\", focusing on the experience of the viewer rather than the artist.[15] This was encapsulated by his design of a new flag for New Zealand, which incorporated the image of the Koru a spiral shape based on the image of a new unfurling silver fern frond and symbolizing new life, growth, strength and peace according to the M\u0101ori people.[16]\n Even though Hundertwasser first achieved notoriety for his boldly-coloured paintings, he is more widely known for his individual architectural designs. These designs use irregular forms, and incorporate natural features of the landscape. The Hundertwasserhaus apartment block in Vienna has undulating floors (\"an uneven floor is a melody to the feet\"), a roof covered with earth and grass, and large trees growing from inside the rooms, with limbs extending from windows. He took no payment for the design of Hundertwasserhaus, declaring that it was worth the investment to \"prevent something ugly from going up in its place\".\n From the early 1950s he increasingly focused on architecture, advocating more just human and environmental friendly buildings. This began with manifestos, essays and demonstrations. For example, he read out his \"Mouldiness Manifesto against Rationalism in Architecture\" in 1958 on the occasion of an art and architectural event held at the Seckau Monastery. He rejected the straight line and the functional architecture.[17] In Munich in 1967 he gave a lecture called \"Speech in Nude for the Right to a Third Skin\". His lecture \"Loose from Loos, A Law Permitting Individual Buildings Alterations or Architecture-Boycott Manifesto\", was given at the Concordia Press Club in Vienna in 1968.\n In the Mouldiness Manifesto he first claimed the \"Window Right\": \"A person in a rented apartment must be able to lean out of his window and scrape off the masonry within arm's reach. And he must be allowed to take a long brush and paint everything outside within arm's reach. So that it will be visible from afar to everyone in the street that someone lives there who is different from the imprisoned, enslaved, standardised man who lives next door.\"[14] In his nude speeches of 1967 and 1968 Hundertwasser condemned the enslavement of humans by the sterile grid system of conventional architecture and by the output of mechanised industrial production.[18] He rejected rationalism, the straight line and functional architecture.[19]\n For Hundertwasser, human misery was a result of the rational, sterile, monotonous architecture, built following the tradition of the Austrian architect Adolf Loos, author of the modernist manifesto Ornament and crime (1908). He called for a boycott of this type of architecture, and demanded instead creative freedom of building, and the right to create individual structures.[20] In 1972 he published the manifesto Your window right \u2014 your tree duty. Planting trees in an urban environment was to become obligatory: \"If man walks in nature's midst, then he is nature's guest and must learn to behave as a well-brought-up guest.\" Hundertwasser propagated a type of architecture in harmony with nature in his ecological commitment. He campaigned for the preservation of the natural habitat and demanded a life in accordance with the laws of nature. He wrote numerous manifestos, lectured and designed posters in favor of nature protection, including against nuclear power, to save the oceans and the whales and to protect the rain forest. He was also an advocate of composting toilets and the principle of constructed wetland. He perceived feces not as nauseous but as part of the cycle of nature. His beliefs are testified by his manifesto The Holy Shit and his DIY guide for building a composting toilet.[21]\n In the 1970s, Hundertwasser had his first architectural models built.[citation needed] The models for the Eurovision TV-show \"W\u00fcnsch Dir was\" (Make a Wish) in 1972 exemplified his ideas on forested roofs, tree tenants and the window right. In these and similar models he developed new architectural shapes, such as the spiral house, the eye-slit house, the terrace house and the high-rise meadow house. \nIn 1974, Peter Manhardt made models for him of the pit-house, the grass roof house and the green service station \u2013 along with his idea of the invisible, inaudible Green Motorway.[22]\n In the early 1980s Hundertwasser remodelled the Rosenthal Factory in Selb, and the Mierka Grain Silo in Krems. These projects gave him the opportunity to act as what he called an \"architecture doctor\".[citation needed]\n In architectural projects that followed he implemented window right and tree tenants, uneven floors, woods on the roof, and spontaneous vegetation.[citation needed] Works of this period include: housing complexes in Germany; a church in B\u00e4rnbach, Austria; a district heating plant in Vienna; an incineration plant and sludge centre in Osaka, Japan; a railway station in Uelzen; a winery in Napa Valley; and the Hundertwasser toilet in Kawakawa.\n In 1999 Hundertwasser started his last project named Die Gr\u00fcne Zitadelle von Magdeburg (in German). Although he never completed this work, the building was built a few years later in Magdeburg, a town in eastern Germany, and opened on October 3, 2005.[23]\n An art gallery featuring Hundertwasser's work will be established in a council building in Whang\u0101rei, New Zealand, and will bring to fruition his 1993 plans for improving the building.[26]\n The extensive work of Hundertwasser includes 26 stamps for various postal administrations. Seventeen of these designs were \u2013 in part after his death \u2013 implemented as a postage stamp.\n Two of the unrealized designs are alternative designs for a stamp issue (United Nations, Senegal) and were therefore not performed. Seven other designs created for the postal administrations of Morocco and French Polynesia, were not realized as a postage stamp.\n In addition, Friedensreich Hundertwasser, has adapted some of his works for stamp issues. On the basis of these adaptations have been stamps issued by:\n The Austrian post office used more Hundertwasser motives for the European edition 1987 (Modern architecture, Hundertwasser House), on the occasion of his death in 2000 (painting Blue Blues, under the WIPA 2000) and 2004 National Donauauen (poster: The outdoors is our freedom at civil protests in Hainburg).\n For the first time a Hundertwasser motive was also used on a Cuban stamp, as part of the art exhibition Salon de Mayo (Havana, 1967).\n With the exception of service marks for the Council of Europe and the Cuban stamp, all stamps were engraved by Wolfgang Seidel and by the Austrian State Printing Office in a complex combination printing process produces (intaglio printing, rotogravure printing, as well as metal stamping).\n Hundertwasser also worked as a medallist.[27][28]\n ", "tags": ["1928 births", "2000 deaths", "20th-century Austrian painters", "20th-century male artists", "Austrian emigrants to New Zealand", "Austrian male painters", "Abstract painters", "Austrian male sculptors", "Austrian architects", "Austrian performance artists", "Expressionist architects", "Organic architecture", "Green thinkers", "Austrian stamp designers", "Flag designers", "Austrian expatriates in New Zealand", "Austrian Roman Catholics", "Austrian people of Jewish descent", "Artists from Vienna", "People who died at sea", "Academy of Fine Arts Vienna alumni", "People from Kawakawa, New Zealand", "Recipients of the Grand Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria", "Recipients of the Grand Austrian State Prize", "20th-century Austrian sculptors", "Austrian monarchists", "CS1 maint: others", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia pending changes protected pages", "Wikipedia introduction cleanup from October 2014", "All pages needing cleanup", "Articles covered by WikiProject Wikify from October 2014", "All articles covered by WikiProject Wikify", "Articles needing additional references from January 2009", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with multiple maintenance issues", "Use New Zealand English from April 2019", "All Wikipedia articles written in New Zealand English", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from May 2014", "Commons link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with AAG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with FNZA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Austrian-born visual artist\n\n\nThis article has multiple issues.

Seven other designs created for the postal administrations of Morocco and French Polynesia, were not realized as a postage stamp.\nIn addition, Friedensreich Hundertwasser, has adapted some of his works for stamp issues. On the basis of these adaptations have been stamps issued by:\n\nFrance \u2013 2 badges for \u20ac Europe, 1994\nUnited Nations Postal Administration (Vienna, Geneva and New York) \u2013 Social Summit (3 stamps), 1995\nLuxembourg \u2013 European Capital of Culture (3 stamps), 1995\nLiechtenstein \u2013 EXPO 2000 in Hanover (3 stamps), 2000\nThe Austrian post office used more Hundertwasser motives for the European edition 1987 (Modern architecture, Hundertwasser House), on the occasion of his death in 2000 (painting Blue Blues, under the WIPA 2000) and 2004 National Donauauen (poster: The outdoors is our freedom at civil protests in Hainburg).\nFor the first time a Hundertwasser motive was also used on a Cuban stamp, as part of the art exhibition Salon de Mayo (Havana, 1967).\nWith the exception of service marks for the Council of Europe and the Cuban stamp, all stamps were engraved by Wolfgang Seidel and by the Austrian State Printing Office in a complex combination printing process produces (intaglio printing, rotogravure printing, as well as metal stamping).\nHundertwasser also worked as a medallist.[27][28]\n\nBooks[edit]\nIn 1989 Brockhaus released a 24-volume limited special edition of its encyclopedia with 1800 pieces, entirely designed by Hundertwasser. Each individual cover of this edition varies in colour of the linen as well as in the colours of foil stamping, making each copy a unique piece. \"No band, no cover I designed the encyclopedia is equal to the other. Nevertheless, they attack each other with all their differences and come together to form an overall picture. This is networking among themselves a symbol of knowledge, the Brockhaus gives.\" (F.
