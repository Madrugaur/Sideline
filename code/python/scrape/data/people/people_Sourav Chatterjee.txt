{"name": "Sourav Chatterjee", "content": "\n Sourav Chatterjee (born November 1979)[1]  is a mathematician, specializing in mathematical statistics and probability theory. Chatterjee is credited with work on the study of fluctuations in random structures, concentration and super-concentration inequalities, Poisson and other non-normal limits, first-passage percolation, Stein's method and spin glasses.[2][3] He has received numerous prestigious awards including a Sloan Fellowship in mathematics, Tweedie Award,[4] Rollo Davidson Prize, Doeblin Prize, Lo\u00e8ve Prize, and Infosys Prize in mathematical sciences. He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2014. \n Chatterjee received a Bachelor and Master of Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, and a Ph.D from Stanford University in 2005, where he worked under the supervision of Persi Diaconis.[5] Chatterjee joined University of California, Berkeley, as a Visiting Assistant Professor, then received a tenure-track Assistant Professor position in 2006. In July 2009 he became an Associate Professor of Statistics and Mathematics at University of California, Berkeley. Then in September 2009, Chatterjee became an Associate Professor of Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University.[6] He spent the academic year 2012-2013 as a Visiting Associate Professor of Mathematics and Statistics at Stanford University. Since autumn 2013 he has joined the faculty of Stanford University as a full professor with joint appointments in the departments of Mathematics and Statistics.[7]\n He has served as an Associate Editor of Annals of Probability,Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9 (B) Probabilities et Statistiques, \"Probability Theory and Related Fields\".
