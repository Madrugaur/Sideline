{"name": "Jacqueline Ferrand", "content": "Jacqueline Lelong-Ferrand (17 February 1918, Al\u00e8s, France \u2013 26 April 2014, Sceaux, France) was a French mathematician who worked on conformal representation theory, potential theory, and Riemannian manifolds. She taught at universities in  Caen, Lille, and Paris.[1][2][3]\n Ferrand was born in Al\u00e8s, the daughter of a classics teacher, and went to secondary school in N\u00eemes.[4]\nIn 1936 the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure began admitting women, and she was one of the first to apply and be admitted. In 1939 she and Roger Ap\u00e9ry placed first in the mathematics agr\u00e9gation; she began teaching at a girls' school in S\u00e8vres, while continuing to do mathematics research under the supervision of Arnaud Denjoy, publishing three papers in 1941 and defending a doctoral thesis in 1942.[4][5][6] In 1943 she won the Girbal-Baral Prize of the French Academy of Sciences, and obtained a faculty position at the University of Bordeaux. She moved to the University of Caen in 1945, was given a chair at the University of Lille in 1948, and in 1956 moved to the University of Paris as a full professor.
