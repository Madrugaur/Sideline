{"name": "Christian de Portzamparc", "content": "Christian de Portzamparc (French pronunciation:\u00a0\u200b[k\u0281istj\u0251\u0303 d\u0259 p\u0254\u0281tz\u0251\u0303pa\u0281k]; born 5 May 1944) is a French architect and urbanist. \n He graduated from the \u00c9cole Nationale des Beaux Arts[1] in Paris in 1970 and has since been noted for his bold designs and artistic touch; his projects reflect a sensibility to their environment and to urbanism that is a founding principle of his work.[2]\n He was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 1994.[3]\n De Portzamparc was born in Casablanca, Morocco in 1944, when that country was a French protectorate, to a family of Breton noble descent.[4] He began studying architecture in 1962 at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris where he was influenced by professors Eug\u00e8ne Beaudouin, who \"encouraged his taste for formal expressionism\", and George Candilis, who \"emphasized systematic work on grids and networks.\"[5] In 1966 he traveled to New York where he spent a few months during a nine-month academic hiatus that was rooted in his hesitations about continuing in architecture\u2014\"Architecture seemed to me to be too bureaucratic, and not free enough compared to art; and the modernistic ideals which I worshiped before, seemed to me unable to reach the richness of real life. I also began to criticize my first influences like Le Corbusier\".[5] Nevertheless, he returned to his studies in the 1967 academic year and would graduate from the Beaux-Arts in 1969.[5]  He created his agency in 1980, supported by Marie-\u00c9lisabeth Nicoleau, \u00c9tienne Pierr\u00e8s and Bertrand Beau, and later welcomed Bruno Durbecq, C\u00e9line Barda, L\u00e9a Xu, Andr\u00e9 Terzibachian and Clovis Cunha. Based in Paris, the agency has 'satellite' offices near building sites, in addition to offices in New York and Rio de Janeiro, and represents a team of 80 people, drawn from all corners of the globe.[6]\n Both an architect and urban planner, Christian de Portzamparc is implicated in the research of form and meaning, as well as being a constructer. His work focuses on research over speculation and concerns the quality of life; aesthetics are conditioned by ethics, and he maintains that we have too often dissociated one from the other. Christian de Portzamparc focuses on all scales of construction, from simple buildings to urban re-think; the town is a founding principal of his work, developing in parallel and in crossover along three major lines: neighbourhood or city pieces, individual buildings and sky-scrapers.[7]\n The growth of Christian de Portzamparc's urban projects through competitions and studies led to an evolution of methods, a practical result of theoretical research and analysis. This renewed vision of urban structure, which he named the \"open block\" in the 80s, can be seen today through projects such as the Quartier Mass\u00e9na - Seine Rive Gauche (since 1995), an entire neighbourhood of Paris, and at La Lironde (since 1991), in the south of France, both of which illustrate his master-planning and coordination techniques.[8]\n Christian de Portzamparc's buildings create environments wherein the interior and exterior spaces interpenetrate, working as catalysts in cityscape dynamics. This method of functioning came into play in major cultural programmes, often dedicated to dance and music, the most recent examples of which include a 1500-seat philharmonic hall, 300 seat chamber hall and 120 seat electro-acoustic hall in Luxembourg, completed in 2005, plus a unique 1800 seat concert hall that transforms into a 1300-seat opera house, which is under construction, amongst other music halls, as part of the project Cidade da M\u00fasica in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n The towers created by Christian de Portzamparc have, since the beginning, been a result of his studies of the vertical and sculptural dimension, concentrating on the prismatic form, the most recognised example of which is the LVMH Tower created in 1995 in New York, USA, for which Christian de Portzamparc received many accolades, soon to be accompanied by the residential tower at 400 Park avenue in Manhattan, whose construction commenced in 2010.\n In 1994, Christian de Portzamparc became the first French architect to gain the prestigious \"Pritzker Architectural Prize\", at the age of 50.[9]\n In 1999, he created the twenty-three story LVMH Tower on East 57th Street in New York City and, later, the LVMH's corporate headquarters on Avenue Montaigne in Paris, France.[9]\n In 2006, the Coll\u00e8ge de France created a 53rd chair dedicated 'artistic creation', and called on Christian de Portzamparc to be its first occupant. Today, he continues his research work through projects that are under way around the world, expressing his freshness, pleasure and passion through a perfectionism that has characterised his work from the beginning.[citation needed]\n \n ", "tags": ["20th-century French architects", "21st-century French architects", "Modernist architecture in France", "Pritzker Architecture Prize winners", "Skyscraper architects", "1944 births", "Living people", "People from Casablanca", "Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Commandeurs of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres", "Officers of the National Order of Merit (France)", "Alumni of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts", "French people of Breton descent", "Articles with peacock terms from June 2017", "All articles with peacock terms", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from May 2015", "Articles with unsourced statements from August 2019", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with suppressed authority control identifiers"], "raw": "This article contains wording that promotes the subject in a subjective manner without imparting real information.
