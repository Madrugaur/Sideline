Galil served as the President of Tel Aviv University from 2007 through 2009. From 2010 to 2019, he was the dean of the Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing.[3] His research interests include the design and analysis of algorithms, computational complexity and cryptography. He has been credited with coining the terms stringology and sparsification.[4][5]  He has published over 200 scientific papers[6] and is listed as an ISI highly cited researcher.[7]\n Zvi Galil was born in Tel Aviv in Mandatory Palestine in 1947. He completed both his B.Sc. (1970) and his M.Sc. (1971) in Applied Mathematics, both summa cum laude, at Tel Aviv University before earning his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Cornell in 1975 under the supervision of John Hopcroft.[2] He then spent a year working as a post-doctorate researcher at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York.[8]\n From 1976 until 1995 he worked in the computer science department of Tel Aviv University, serving as its chair from 1979 to 1982. In 1982 he joined the faculty of Columbia University, serving as the chair of the Computer Science Department from 1989-1994.[1][8] From 1995-2007, he served as the dean of the Fu Foundation School of Engineering & Applied Science.[9] In this position, he oversaw the naming of the school in honor of Chinese businessman Z. Y. Fu after a large donation was given in his name.[10] At Columbia, he was appointed the Julian Clarence Levi Professor of Mathematical Methods and Computer Science in 1987, and the Morris and Alma A. Schapiro Dean of Engineering in 1995.[1]\n Galil served as the President of Tel Aviv University starting in 2007 (following Itamar Rabinovich),[11] but resigned and returned to the faculty in 2009, and was succeeded by Joseph Klafter.[12][13] He was named as the dean of Georgia Tech's College of Computing on April 9, 2010.[3] At Georgia Tech, together with Udacity founder Sebastian Thrun, Galil conceived of the College of Computing\u2019s Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program, and he led the faculty creation of the program.[14] OMSCS went on to become the largest online master\u2019s program in computer science in the United States.[15] Galil stepped down as dean and returned to a regular faculty position in June 2019.[16][17]\n In 1982, Galil founded the Columbia University Theory Day and organized the event for the first 15 years. It still exists as the New York Area Theory Day.[18] From 1983 to 1987, Galil served as the chairman of ACM SIGACT, an organization that promotes research in theoretical computer science.[19] He served as managing editor of SIAM Journal on Computing from 1991 to 1997 and editor in chief of Journal of Algorithms from 1988 to 2003.\n Galil's research is in the areas of algorithms, particularly string and graph algorithms, complexity, cryptography and experimental design. Among his most highly cited work are the following:\n In 1995, Galil was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery for \"fundamental contributions to the design and analysis of algorithms and outstanding service to the theoretical computer science community,\"[20] and in 2004, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering for \"contributions to the design and analysis of algorithms and for leadership in computer science and engineering.\"[21][22] In 2005, he was selected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[23] In 2008, Columbia University established the Zvi Galil award for student life.[24] In 2009, the Columbia Society of Graduates awarded him the Great Teacher Award.[25] In 2012, The University of Waterloo awarded Galil with an honorary Doctor of Mathematics degree for his \"fundamental contributions in the areas of graph algorithms and string matching.\"[26]\n ", "tags": ["Columbia University faculty", "Cornell University alumni", "Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery", "Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science", "Israeli computer scientists", "Israeli mathematicians", "Theoretical computer scientists", "1947 births", "Living people", "People from Tel Aviv", "Tel Aviv University alumni", "Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering", "Georgia Tech faculty", "IBM Research computer scientists", "Highly Cited Researchers", "Presidents of universities in Israel", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers"], "raw": "Israeli mathematician and computer scientist\nZvi GalilGalil in 2010Born (1947-06-26) June 26, 1947 (age\u00a073)[1]Tel Aviv, Mandatory Palestine[1]Nationality\nIsraeli\nAmerican\nAlma\u00a0mater\nTel Aviv University\nCornell\nAwards\nACM Fellow\nNAE Member\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences Fellow\nScientific careerFields\nComputer science\nMathematics\nInstitutions\nIBM Thomas J.
