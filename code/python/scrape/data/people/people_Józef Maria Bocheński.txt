{"name": "J\u00f3zef Maria Boche\u0144ski", "content": "J\u00f3zef Maria Boche\u0144ski (Czusz\u00f3w, Congress Poland, Russian Empire, 30 August 1902 \u2013 8 February 1995, Fribourg, Switzerland) was a Polish Dominican, logician and philosopher.\n After taking part in the 1920 campaign against Soviet Russia, he took up legal studies in Lw\u00f3w, then studied economics in Pozna\u0144. Boche\u0144ski earned a doctorate in philosophy (he studied in Fribourg in Switzerland, 1928\u201331).  He was also an alumnus of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome where he studied Sacred Theology from 1931 to 1934 earning a doctorate in Sacred Theology. Boche\u0144ski was a professor of logic at the Angelicum until 1940.\n During World War II he served as chaplain to Polish forces during the 1939 invasion of Poland, was taken prisoner of war, escaped the Germans and reached Rome. He joined the Polish Army and served as chaplain first in France, then in England. He fought as a soldier in 1944 in the Italian campaign of the Polish II Corps at Monte Cassino.\n In 1945 he received the chair in the history of twentieth-century philosophy at the University of Fribourg (of which he was rector in 1964-66); he founded and ran the Institute of Eastern Europe there, and published the journal Studies in Soviet Thought and a book series concerned with the foundations of Marxist philosophy (Sovietica).\n Boche\u0144ski served as consultant to several governments: West Germany (under Konrad Adenauer), South Africa, the United States, Argentina, and Switzerland.\n Before 1989 none of his works were published officially in Poland.\n Boche\u0144ski is perhaps the most famous exponent of the Cracow Circle Thomism, which has been called \"the most significant expression of Catholic thought between the two World Wars.\"[1] The Circle was founded by a group of philosophers and theologians that, in distinction from traditional neo-Thomism, embraced modern formal logic and applied it to traditional Thomist philosophy and theology.[2] Inspired by the logical clarity of Aquinas, members of the Circle held both philosophy and theology to contain \"propositions with truth-values\u2026a structured body of propositions connected in meaning and subject matter, and linked by logical relations of compatibility and incompatibility, entailment etc.\"  \"The Cracow Circle set about investigating and where possible improving this logical structure with the most advanced logical tools available at the time, namely those of modern mathematical logic, then called \u2018logistic\u2019.\" [3]  Other members of the Circle included Jan Salamucha and Jan F. Drewnowski.\n Bochenski said \"that once when he went to visit Lukasiewicz before the war [World War II], Lukasiewicz conveyed him inside excitedly, indicated a complex formula, beginning something like 'CCC...', and said, 'Look at this beautiful and self-evidently true formula.'  Clearly the formula's truth was not immediately evident to the bemused Bochenski.\"[4]\n In Boche\u0144ski's Pr\u00e9cis de logique math\u00e9matique, he uses this notation, in the style of \u0141ukasiewicz:[5]\n Robert Blanch\u00e9 quoted a passage of Bochenski\u2019s Formale Logik in Structure intellectuelles (1966, 39): \"Hindu logic knows of three logical propositions and not the four of western logic. For it Some S are P does not signify Some S at least are P but Some S are P but not all.\" This passage shows that Indian tradition explicitly speaks of the existence of partial quantity, the third quantity to be considered along with totality apprehended by A the universal affirmative of the square, and zero quantity apprehended by E the universal negative of the square. To the two universals A and E entertaining a relationship of contrariety, one should add the third contrary constituted by the double negation of the first two. As the subcontrary I contradicts E and the subcontrary O contradicts A, the logical proposition apprehending partial quantity can be represented by the conjunction of I and O\u00a0: I & O. In Blanch\u00e9\u2019s logical hexagon this conjunction is symbolized by the letter Y. Many scholars[who?] think that the logical square of opposition, representing four values, should be replaced by the logical hexagon, which has the power to express more relations of opposition.\n ", "tags": ["Polish logicians", "People from Proszowice County", "Catholic philosophers", "Polish Dominicans", "1902 births", "1995 deaths", "20th-century Polish philosophers", "Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas alumni", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles needing additional references from March 2009", "All articles needing additional references", "All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases", "Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from July 2014", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "AC with 26 elements", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.
