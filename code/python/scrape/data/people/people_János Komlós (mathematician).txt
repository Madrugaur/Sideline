In probabilistic terminology, the theorem is as follows. Let \u03be1,\u03be2,... be a sequence of random variables such that E[\u03be1],E[\u03be2],... is bounded. Then there exist a subsequence \u03be'1, \u03be'2,... and a random variable \u03b2 such that for each further subsequence \u03b71,\u03b72,... of \u03be'0, \u03be'1,...  we have (\u03b71+...+\u03b7n)/n \u2192 \u03b2 a.s.\nWith Mikl\u00f3s Ajtai and Endre Szemer\u00e9di he proved[3] the ct2/log t upper bound for the Ramsey number R(3,t). The corresponding lower bound was established by Jeong Han Kim only in 1995, and this result earned him a Fulkerson Prize.\nThe same team of authors  developed the optimal Ajtai\u2013Koml\u00f3s\u2013Szemer\u00e9di sorting network.[4]\nKoml\u00f3s and Szemer\u00e9di proved that if G is a random graph on n vertices  with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nn\nlog\n\u2061\nn\n+\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nn\nlog\n\u2061\nlog\n\u2061\nn\n+\nc\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}n\\log n+{\\frac {1}{2}}n\\log \\log n+cn}\n\n\nedges, where c is a fixed real number, then the probability that G has a Hamiltonian circuit converges to\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\u2212\n\ne\n\n\u2212\n2\nc\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e^{-e^{-2c}}.}\n\n\nWith G\u00e1bor S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy and Endre Szemer\u00e9di he proved the so-called blow-up lemma which claims that the regular pairs in Szemer\u00e9di's regularity lemma are similar to complete bipartite graphs when considering the embedding of graphs with bounded degrees.[5]\nKoml\u00f3s worked on Heilbronn's problem; he,  J\u00e1nos Pintz and Szemer\u00e9di disproved Heilbronn's conjecture.[6]\nKoml\u00f3s also wrote highly cited papers on sums of random variables,[7] space-efficient representations of sparse sets,[8] random matrices,[9] the Szemer\u00e9di regularity lemma,[10] and derandomization.[11]\nDegrees, awards[edit]\nKoml\u00f3s received his Ph.D. in 1967 from E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University under the supervision of Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi.[12] In 1975 he received the Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Prize, a prize established for  researchers of the Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics.
