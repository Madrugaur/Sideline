{"name": "Paul V. Roberts", "content": "Paul V. Roberts (November 27, 1938 - February 2006) was a prominent environmental engineer. He made major contributions to environmental engineering by applying fundamental principles of mass transport and chemistry to drinking water treatment and wastewater reclamation research. An author of more than 200 scientific publications, he was a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the Swiss Academy of Sciences.\n Paul Roberts graduated with a BS degree in chemical engineering from Princeton University in 1960, and received a Ph.D. degree in chemical engineering from Cornell University in 1966.[1]  He taught at the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Valpara\u00edso and the Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda in Chile, and worked as a process engineer with Chevron Research Company in Richmond, California. In 1968, he joined the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park. After he received a M.S. degree in environmental engineering at Stanford University in 1971,[1] he joined the Swiss Federal Institute of Water Supply and Water Pollution Control.[1]  In 1976 he left his position as the head of the engineering department at the Institute and began his career at Stanford. In 1989 Roberts was named the C.L. Peck, Class of 1906 Professor in the School of Engineering.

His broad body of work spans such topics as reclaimed wastewater, drinking water disinfection, adsorption and volatilization of organic contaminants during water and wastewater treatment, contaminant transport in groundwater, and multiphase flow in porous media. He is perhaps best known for conceiving and directing the first and probably the most definitive field study ever conducted on the movement and fate of hazardous chemicals in groundwater at the Borden site in Canada.
