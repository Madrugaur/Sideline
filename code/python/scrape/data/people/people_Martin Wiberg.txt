The logarithmic tables were subsequently published in English, French and German in 1876. The device was investigated by the French academy of science which also wrote an extensive report on it in 1863.[1] The device was inspired by the similar work done by Per Georg Scheutz[2] (had the same capacity: 15-digit numbers and fourth-order differences) and has similarities with Charles Babbage's difference engine.

Wiberg failed to sell his machine, and also failed to sell the output tables due to their bad looks.[5][6][7]\n Apart from this invention, Wiberg invented numerous other devices and gadgets, among these a cream separator and a pulse jet engine.
