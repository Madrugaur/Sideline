Cascini, C. Hacon and J. McKernan).[8] He was awarded the Fields Medal in 2018, \"for his proof of boundedness of Fano varieties and contributions to the minimal model program\".[9] His favorite mathematician is Alexander Grothendieck.[10][11]In his office at the University of Cambridge, Birkar has two photographs of Grothendieck, who was a refugee and a Fields medalist, just like Birkar.[12]\n \n Birkar is an ethnic Kurd, and was born in 1978 in Marivan County, Kurdistan Province, Iran, on a subsistence farm, and raised during the Iran-Iraq War.[13] He studied mathematics at the University of Tehran where he received his bachelor's degree. He was awarded the third prize in the International Mathematics Competition for University Students in 2000[14] and, shortly after, while still studying in the University, relocated to the UK as a refugee and asked for political asylum.[15] In 2001\u20132004 Birkar was a PhD student at the University of Nottingham.[16] In 2003 he was awarded the Cecil King Travel Scholarship by the London Mathematical Society as the most promising PhD student.[17] Upon emigrating to the UK he changed his name to Caucher Birkar, which means \"migrant mathematician\" in Kurdish.[18]\n Together with Paolo Cascini, Christopher Hacon and James McKernan, Birkar settled several conjectures including existence of log flips, finite generation of log canonical rings, and existence of minimal models for varieties of log general type, building upon earlier work of Vyacheslav Shokurov and of Hacon and McKernan.[19]\n In the setting of log canonical singularities, he proved existence of log flips along with key cases of the minimal model and abundance conjectures.  (This was also proved independently by Hacon and Chenyang Xu.)[20]\n In a different direction, he studied the old problem of Iitaka on effectivity of Iitaka fibrations induced by pluri-canonical systems on varieties of non-negative Kodaira dimension. The problem consists of two halves: one related to general fibres of the fibration and one related to the base of the fibration. Birkar and Zhang co-solved the second half of the problem, hence essentially reducing Iitaka's problem to the special case of Kodaira dimension zero.[21]\n In more recent work, Birkar studied Fano varieties and singularities of linear systems. He proved several fundamental problems such as Shokurov's conjecture on boundedness of complements and Borisov\u2013Alexeev\u2013Borisov conjecture on boundedness of Fano varieties.[22][23] In 2018, Birkar was given the Fields Medal for his Fano varieties and his other contributions the minimal model problem.[9] In a video made available by the Simons Foundation, Birkar expressed hope that his Fields Medal will put \u201cjust a little smile on the lips\u201d of the world's estimated 40 million Kurds.[24] Birkar's Fields Medal was stolen on the same day it was awarded to him.[25] In a special ceremony at ICM 2018, Birkar was presented with a replacement medal.[26]\n Birkar is also active in the field of birational geometry over fields of positive characteristic. His work together with work of Hacon-Xu nearly completes the minimal model program for 3-folds over fields of characteristic at least 7.[27]\n ", "tags": ["Fields Medalists", "Living people", "People from Kurdistan Province", "Iranian Kurdish people", "Iranian emigrants to the United Kingdom", "British people of Kurdish descent", "Iranian Mathematics Competition Medalists", "Iranian mathematicians", "University of Tehran alumni", "Alumni of the University of Nottingham", "British mathematicians", "Iranian refugees", "Refugees in the United Kingdom", "British people of Iranian descent", "Cambridge mathematicians", "Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge", "1978 births", "Kurdish people", "CS1 Persian-language sources (fa)", "CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "CS1 maint: others", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Kurdish-language text", "Articles containing Persian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Kurdish mathematician\nCaucher BirkarFRSBornFereydoun Derakhshani[1][2]1978 (age\u00a042\u201343)Ney, Marivan County, IranCitizenshipIran, BritainAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Tehran (BSc) University of Nottingham (PhD)Children1AwardsLeverhulme Prize (2010)Moore Prize (2016)Fields Medal (2018)Scientific careerFieldsAlgebraic geometryBirational geometryInstitutionsUniversity of CambridgeThesisTopics in Modern Algebraic Geometry\u00a0(2004)Doctoral advisor\nIvan Fesenko\nVyacheslav Shokurov[3]\nInfluenceselder brother[4]\nWebsitewww.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~cb496\nCaucher Birkar FRS (Kurdish: \u06a9\u06c6\u0686\u06d5\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0631/Ko\u00e7er B\u00eerkar\u200e, lit.\u2009'migrant mathematician'; born Fereydoun Derakhshani (Persian: \u0641\u0631\u06cc\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u062e\u0634\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u200e); July 1978) is a UK-based Iranian Kurdish mathematician and a professor at the University of Cambridge.[3][5]\nBirkar is an important contributor to modern birational geometry.[6] In 2010 he received the Leverhulme Prize in mathematics and statistics for his contributions to algebraic geometry,[7] and in 2016, the AMS Moore Prize for the article \"Existence of minimal models for varieties of log general type\", Journal of the AMS (2010) (joint with P.
