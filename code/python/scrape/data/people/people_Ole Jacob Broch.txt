{"name": "Ole Jacob Broch", "content": "Ole Jacob Broch (14 January 1818 \u2013 5 February 1889) was a Norwegian mathematician, physicist, economist and government minister.[1]\n Broch was born at Fredrikstad in \u00d8stfold, Norway. He was the son of war commissary Johan J\u00f8rgen Broch (1791\u20131860) and Jensine Laurentze Bentzen (1790\u20131877) and the brother of the orientalist and linguist, Jens Peter Broch.[2] He attended Kristiansand Cathedral School and showed a talent for mathematics at an early age. He attended the Overl\u00e6rer M\u00f8ller Institute in Christiania (now Oslo) and later studied at the University of Christiania (now University of Oslo). He also traveled abroad for studies in Paris, Berlin and K\u00f6nigsberg, during which he developed an interest in optics and statistics.[2]\n After returning to Norway, he worked with his friend and colleague Hartvig Nissen to found the school Hartvig Nissens skole in 1843, which were to have an emphasis on natural sciences and modern languages.[3] After finishing his doctorate in 1847, he returned to a position at the University that he had resigned to work with Nissen.[2] He also taught at the Military Academy, and in 1847 he founded the insurance company Gjensidige (under the name \"Christiania almindelige, gjensidige Fors\u00f8rgelsesanstalt\"),[3] which was Scandinavia's first life insurance company.[2]\n Broch entered politics as a local politician in Christiania, and in the period 1862\u201369 he represented the city in the Storting.[2] In 1869, he was appointed Minister of the Navy in the first cabinet of Frederik Stang. After serving as a member of the Council of State Division in Stockholm in 1871\u201372, he returned as Minister of the Navy briefly in 1872.[4] He resigned over differences with his colleagues about government ministers' access to the parliament.[5]\n After this his attention turned to international tasks. In 1879 he became a member, and in 1883 director of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in S\u00e8vres, France.[2] This work took up much of the remainder of Broch's life, but in 1884 he was recalled to Norway to attempt to form a government. The constitutional crisis which caused the fall of the so-called April Ministerium of Christian Homann Schweigaard, led to the demand for a new prime minister. Broch failed in this attempt, and returned to France, where he died a few years later. He was buried at Var Frelsers gravlund in Oslo.[2]\n Broch received several honours for his scientific and political work. He was a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters from 1849, and he received the Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1879.[2]\n Internationally, he was created grand officer of the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur, and Commander Grand Cross of the Swedish Order of the Polar Star.[2]\n Broch\u00f8ya, an island off the north coast of Nordaustlandet in Svalbard, was named after him.[6]\n ", "tags": ["1818 births", "1889 deaths", "People from Fredrikstad", "People educated at Kristiansand Cathedral School", "University of Oslo alumni", "Norwegian mathematicians", "Norwegian educators", "Norwegian physicists", "Norwegian economists", "Members of the Storting", "Government ministers of Norway", "Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences", "Grand Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters", "Commanders Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star", "Recipients of the St. Olav's Medal", "Norwegian Military Academy faculty", "Burials at the Cemetery of Our Saviour", "CS1 Norwegian-language sources (no)", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": " Ole Jacob Broch.\nOle Jacob Broch (14 January 1818 \u2013 5 February 1889) was a Norwegian mathematician, physicist, economist and government minister.[1]\n\n Ole Jacob Broch\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Honors\n3 Selected works\n4 References\n5 Further reading\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nBroch was born at Fredrikstad in \u00d8stfold, Norway.
