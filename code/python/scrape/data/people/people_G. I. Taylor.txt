{"name": "G. I. Taylor", "content": "\n Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor OM FRS FRSE (7 March 1886 \u2013 27 June 1975) was a British physicist and mathematician, and a major figure in fluid dynamics and wave theory. His biographer and one-time student, George Batchelor, described him as \"one of the most notable scientists of this (the 20th) century\".[4][5][6][7]\n Taylor was born in St. John's Wood, London. His father, Edward Ingram Taylor, was an artist, and his mother, Margaret Boole, came from a family of mathematicians (his aunt was Alicia Boole Stott and his grandfather was George Boole).  As a child he was fascinated by science after attending the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, and performed experiments using paint rollers and sticky-tape. Taylor read mathematics and physics at Trinity College, Cambridge from 1905 to 1908. Then he obtained a scholarship to continue at Cambridge under J. J. Thomson.\n Taylor is best known to students of physics for his very first paper,[8] published while he was still an undergraduate, in which he showed that interference of visible light produced fringes even with extremely weak light sources. The interference effects were produced with light from a gas light, attenuated through a series of dark glass plates, diffracting around a sewing needle. Three months were required to produce a sufficient exposure of the photographic plate. The paper does not mention quanta of light (photons) and does not reference Einstein's 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, but today the result can be interpreted by saying that less than one photon on average was present at a time. Once it became widely accepted ca. 1927 that the electromagnetic field was quantized, Taylor's experiment began to be presented in pedagogical treatments as evidence that interference effects with light cannot be interpreted in terms of one photon interfering with another photon\u2014that, in fact, a single photon must travel through both slits of a double-slit apparatus. Modern understanding of the subject has shown that the conditions in Taylor's experiment were not in fact sufficient to demonstrate this, because the light source was not in fact a single-photon source, but the experiment was reproduced in 1986 using a single-photon source, and the same result was obtained.[9]\n He followed this up with work on shock waves,[citation needed] winning a Smith's Prize. In 1910 he was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity College, and the following year he was appointed to a meteorology post, becoming Reader in Dynamical Meteorology. His work on turbulence in the atmosphere led to the publication of \"Turbulent motion in fluids\",[10] which won him the Adams Prize in 1915.\n In 1913 Taylor served as a meteorologist aboard the Ice Patrol vessel Scotia, where his observations formed the basis of his later work on a theoretical model of mixing of the air. At the outbreak of World War I, he was sent to the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough to apply his knowledge to aircraft design, working, amongst other things, on the stress on propeller shafts. Not content just to sit back and do the science, he also learned to fly aeroplanes and make parachute jumps.\n After the war Taylor returned to Trinity and worked on an application of turbulent flow to oceanography. He also worked on the problem of bodies passing through a rotating fluid. In 1923 he was appointed to a Royal Society research professorship as a Yarrow Research Professor. This enabled him to stop teaching, which he had been doing for the previous four years, and which he both disliked and had no great aptitude for. It was in this period that he did his most wide-ranging work on fluid mechanics and solid mechanics, including research on the deformation of crystalline materials which followed from his war work at Farnborough. He also produced another major contribution to turbulent flow, where he introduced a new approach through a statistical study of velocity fluctuations.\n In 1934, Taylor, roughly contemporarily with Michael Polanyi and Egon Orowan, realised that the plastic deformation of ductile materials could be explained in terms of the theory of dislocations developed by Vito Volterra in 1905. The insight was critical in developing the modern science of solid mechanics.\n During World War II, Taylor again applied his expertise to military problems such as the propagation of blast waves, studying both waves in air and underwater explosions. Taylor was sent to the United States in 1944\u20131945 as part of the British delegation to the Manhattan Project. At Los Alamos, Taylor helped solve implosion instability problems in the development of atomic weapons particularly the plutonium bomb used at Nagasaki on 9 August 1945.\n In 1944 he also received his knighthood and the Copley Medal from the Royal Society.\n Taylor was present at the Trinity (nuclear test), July 16, 1945, as part of General Leslie Groves' \"VIP List\" of just 10 people who observed the test from Compania Hill, about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) northwest of the shot tower. By a strange twist, Joan Hinton, another direct descendant of  the mathematician, George Boole, had been working on the same project and witnessed the event in an unofficial capacity. They met at the time but later followed different paths. Joan, strongly opposed to nuclear weapons, defected to Mao's China, while Taylor maintained that political policy was not within the remit of the scientist.[11]\n In 1950, he published two papers estimating the yield of the explosion using the Buckingham Pi theorem, and high speed photography stills from that test, bearing timestamps and physical scale of the blast radius, which had been published in Life magazine.  His estimate of 22 kt was remarkably close to the accepted value of 20 kt, which was still highly classified at that time.\n Taylor continued his research after the war, serving on the Aeronautical Research Committee and working on the development of supersonic aircraft. Though he officially retired in 1952, he continued research for the next twenty years, concentrating on problems that could be attacked using simple equipment. This led to such advances as a method for measuring the second coefficient of viscosity.[citation needed] Taylor devised an incompressible liquid with separated gas bubbles suspended in it.[citation needed] The dissipation of the gas in the liquid during expansion was a consequence of the shear viscosity of the liquid. Thus the bulk viscosity could easily be calculated. His other late work[citation needed] included the longitudinal dispersion in flow in tubes,[12] movement through porous surfaces, and the dynamics of sheets of liquids.\n Aspects of Taylor's life often found expression in his work. His over-riding interest in the movement of air and water, and by extension his studies of the movement of unicellular marine creatures and of weather, were related to his lifelong love of sailing. In the 1930s he invented the 'CQR' anchor, which was both stronger and more manageable than any in use, and which was used for all sorts of small craft including seaplanes.[13]\n His final research paper[citation needed] was published in 1969, when he was 83. In it he resumed his interest in electrical activity in thunderstorms, as jets of conducting liquid motivated by electrical fields. The cone from which such jets are observed is called the Taylor cone, after him. In the same year Taylor received the A. A. Griffith Medal and Prize and was appointed to the Order of Merit.\n Taylor married Grace Stephanie Frances Ravenhill, a school teacher in 1925. They stayed together until Stephanie's death in 1965. Taylor suffered a severe stroke in 1972 which effectively put an end to his work. He died in Cambridge in 1975.\n ", "tags": ["1886 births", "1975 deaths", "English mathematicians", "English physicists", "English meteorologists", "English inventors", "Manhattan Project people", "Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge", "Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Order of Merit", "Knights Bachelor", "Recipients of the Copley Medal", "Royal Institution Christmas Lectures", "Royal Medal winners", "20th-century mathematicians", "People educated at University College School", "Aerodynamicists", "Fluid dynamicists", "20th-century inventors", "EngvarB from August 2014", "Use dmy dates from August 2014", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from January 2017", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BPN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For other people named Geoffrey Taylor, see Geoffrey Taylor (disambiguation).\n\n\nSir Geoffrey Ingram TaylorBorn(1886-03-07)7 March 1886St. John's Wood, Middlesex, EnglandDied27 June 1975(1975-06-27) (aged\u00a089)Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, EnglandNationalityBritishAlma\u00a0materTrinity College, CambridgeKnown\u00a0forTaylor's dislocationTaylor coneTaylor scraping flowTaylor dispersionTaylor numberTaylor\u2013Couette flowTaylor\u2013Goldstein equationRayleigh\u2013Taylor instabilityTaylor\u2013Proudman theoremTaylor\u2013von Neumann\u2013Sedov blast waveTaylor\u2013Green vortexSaffman\u2013Taylor instabilityTaylor microscaleTaylor columnTaylor\u2013Caulfield instabilityTaylor\u2013Culick flowHomogeneous isotropic turbulenceTaylor\u2013Dean flowTaylor's decaying vorticesTaylor-Melcher leaky dielectric modelAwardsKnight BachelorRoyal Medal (1933)Copley Medal (1944)Order of MeritSymons Gold Medal (1951)Wilhelm Exner Medal (1954)De Morgan Medal (1956)Timoshenko Medal (1958)Franklin Medal (1962)FRS[1]Theodore von Karman Medal (1969)Scientific careerFieldsPhysics Mathematics Fluid mechanics  Fluid dynamics  Solid mechanics  Wave theoryAcademic advisorsJ.
