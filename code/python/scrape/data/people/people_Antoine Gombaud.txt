{"name": "Antoine Gombaud", "content": "Antoine Gombaud, Chevalier de M\u00e9r\u00e9 (1607 \u2013 29 December 1684) was a French writer, born in Poitou.[1] Although he was not a nobleman, he adopted the title Chevalier (Knight) for the character in his dialogues who represented his own views (Chevalier de M\u00e9r\u00e9 because he was educated at M\u00e9r\u00e9). Later his friends began calling him by that name.[2]\n M\u00e9r\u00e9 was an important Salon theorist. Like many 17th century liberal thinkers, he distrusted both hereditary power and democracy, a stance at odds with his self-bestowed noble title. He believed that questions are best resolved in open discussions among witty, fashionable, intelligent people.\n M\u00e9r\u00e9's most famous essays are L'honn\u00eate homme (The Honest Man) and Discours de la vraie honn\u00eatet\u00e9 (Discourse on True Honesty),[1] but he is far better known for his contribution to probability theory. He was an amateur mathematician who became interested in a problem that dates to medieval times, if not earlier, the problem of the points. Suppose two players agree to play a certain number of games, say a best-of-seven series, and are interrupted before they can finish. How should the stake be divided among them if, say, one has won three games and the other has won one?[3]\n In keeping with his Salon methods, M\u00e9r\u00e9 enlisted the Mersenne salon to solve it. Two famous mathematicians, Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat, took up the challenge. In a series of letters they laid the foundation for the modern theory of probability.[4]\n M\u00e9r\u00e9 claimed that he had discovered probability theory himself, a claim not taken seriously by the mathematicians involved. He also claimed that his probability calculations showed that mathematics was inconsistent, and argued elsewhere that mathematicians were wrong in thinking that lines are infinitely divisible.[5]\n The spelling used here is that of the 1930 edition of the complete works by \u00c9ditions Fernand Roche.\n ", "tags": ["French essayists", "17th-century French mathematicians", "Probability theorists", "1607 births", "1684 deaths", "17th-century French writers", "17th-century French male writers", "French male essayists", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Antoine Gombaud, Chevalier de M\u00e9r\u00e9 (1607 \u2013 29 December 1684) was a French writer, born in Poitou.[1] Although he was not a nobleman, he adopted the title Chevalier (Knight) for the character in his dialogues who represented his own views (Chevalier de M\u00e9r\u00e9 because he was educated at M\u00e9r\u00e9).
