{"name": "Nicanor Parra", "content": "\n Nicanor Segundo Parra Sandoval (5 September 1914 \u2013 23 January 2018) was a Chilean poet and physicist. He was considered one of the most influential poets in the Spanish language of the 20th century, often compared with Pablo Neruda. Parra described himself as an \"anti-poet,\" due to his distaste for standard poetic pomp and function; after recitations he would exclaim \"Me retracto de todo lo dicho\" (\"I take back everything I said\").\n Parra, the son of a schoolteacher, was born in 1914 in San Fabi\u00e1n de Alico, near Chill\u00e1n, in Chile.[1] He came from the artistically prolific Parra family of performers, musicians, artists, and writers. His sister, Violeta Parra, was a folk singer, as was his brother Roberto Parra Sandoval.\n In 1933, he entered the Instituto Pedag\u00f3gico of the University of Chile, where he qualified as a teacher of mathematics and physics in 1938, one year after the publication of his first book, Cancionero sin Nombre. After teaching in Chilean secondary schools, in 1943 he enrolled in Brown University in the United States to study physics. In 1948, he attended Oxford University to study cosmology.[2] He returned to Chile as a professor at the Universidad de Chile in 1952. Parra served as a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Chile from 1952 to 1991, and was a visiting professor at Louisiana State University, New York University, and Yale University.[3] He read his poetry in England, France, Russia, Mexico, Cuba, and the United States. He published dozens of books.\n His collection Poemas y Antipoemas (1954) is a classic of Latin American literature, one of the most influential Spanish poetry collections of the twentieth century. It is cited as an inspiration by American Beat writers such as Allen Ginsberg.[4][5]\n A fictionalized version of Parra appeared in Alejandro Jodorowsky's autobiographical film Endless Poetry (2016).\n Parra died on 23 January 2018, at 7:00 am, in La Reina in Santiago de Chile, at the age of 103.[6]\n As far I know, only the Mexican poet Mario Santiago has made a lucid reading of his work. We others have only seen a dark meteorite. Parra was proposed on four occasions for the Nobel Prize in Literature.[7] On 1 December 2011, Parra won the Spanish Ministry of Culture's Cervantes Prize, the most important literary prize in the Spanish-speaking world.[8][9] On 7 June 2012, he won the Pablo Neruda Ibero-American Poetry Award.[10]\n English translations\n ", "tags": ["1914 births", "2018 deaths", "Chilean male poets", "Chilean physicists", "People from Chill\u00e1n", "Parra family", "National Prize for Literature (Chile) winners", "Premio Cervantes winners", "University of Chile alumni", "Brown University alumni", "Alumni of St Catherine's College, Oxford", "University of Chile faculty", "Chilean centenarians", "20th-century Chilean poets", "20th-century male writers", "CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)", "Use dmy dates from October 2018", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 maint: others", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Parra and the second or maternal family name is  Sandoval.\nNicanor Parra SandovalBornNicanor Segundo Parra Sandoval(1914-09-05)5 September 1914San Fabi\u00e1n de Alico, ChileDied23 January 2018(2018-01-23) (aged\u00a0103)La Reina, ChileOccupationPoetAwardsMiguel de Cervantes Prize (2011)\nNicanor Segundo Parra Sandoval (5 September 1914 \u2013 23 January 2018) was a Chilean poet and physicist.
