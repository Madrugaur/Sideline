{"name": "Gloria Conyers Hewitt", "content": "Gloria Conyers Hewitt (born 1935) is an American mathematician. She was the fourth African-American woman to receive a PhD in Mathematics.[1][2] Her main research interests were in group theory and abstract algebra. She is the first African American woman to chair a math department in the United States.\n Hewitt was born on October 26, 1935 in Sumter, South Carolina.[3] She entered Fisk University in 1952 and graduated in 1956 with a degree in secondary mathematics education. Without her knowledge, department chairman Lee Lorch recommended Hewitt to two graduate schools. As a result, she was offered a fellowship at the University of Washington in her senior year, though she had not applied for it.[4] Hewitt received her masters from there in 1960, and then her Ph.D. (with a thesis on \"Direct and Inverse Limits of Abstract Algebras\") in 1962.[1][4]\n In 1961, Hewitt joined the faculty at the University of Montana.[4] In 1966 she became tenured and promoted to associate professor, then in 1972, to full professor.[5] In 1995, she was elected chair of the Department of Mathematical Science.[1] She served in that position until she retired in June 1999, with the title of Professor Emeritus.[4][5]\n While a professor at the University of Montana she participated in multiple other organizations. She served on the executive council of the mathematical honor society, Pi Mu Epsilon.[5] She served on the chair of the committee that writes questions for the mathematics section of the GREs.[5] Hewitt was also a faculty consultant for the Advanced Placement examination in calculus.[5] In 1995, she was awarded an ETS Certificate of Appreciation after twelve years of service.[5]\n Hewitt served on the Board of Governors of the Mathematical Association of America.[6]\n She was known for many mathematics reason but most of all for being one of the first three black women to get a mathematics award.\n Hewitt's works focus on two mathematic areas: abstract algebra and group theory.[5] She has eight published research papers and twenty-one unpublished lectures.[5]\n One would expect Hewitt to have to faced many racial and gender oriented obstacles; however, in a personal interview she stated that she did not feel there had been any racial incidences in her career that had a detrimental effect on her studies.[4] She did however, write an article in the Annals of the New York Academy of Science, titled \"The Status of Women in Mathematics\".[7]   Hewitt has said that \"Some of my fellow graduate students did all they could to help and encourage me.  They included me in most of their activities.  I know this situation was not the norm for a lot of Blacks studying mathematics, but I was fortunate enough to be at the right place at the right time\"[6]\n She was awarded a prestigious National Science Foundation postdoctoral Science Faculty Fellowship.
