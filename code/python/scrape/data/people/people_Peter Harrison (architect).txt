{"name": "Peter Harrison (architect)", "content": "Peter Harrison (June 14, 1716 \u2013 April 30, 1775) was a colonial American architect in New England who is credited with bringing the Palladian architectural movement to the colonies.\n Born in York, England, Harrison immigrated to the colony of Rhode Island in 1740 with his brother Joseph Harrison. They initially established themselves as merchants and captains of their own trading vessels.\n Having gained a stake, between 1743 and 1745, Harrison returned to England to receive formal training as an architect. He studied under the direction of an English lord (it is not known which one), among those who trained architects through private studio-schools. They used architectural pattern books, taught drafting and coloring skills, and conducted grand tours of Italy and Greece, where students could see classical structures firsthand. They were taught to become expert draftsmen. These private studio-schools drew from the works of such masters such as the 16th-century Italian Palladio and the classical Roman Vitruvius.\n Through his travels and education in Europe, Harrison acquired a substantial library of books related to classically inspired designs, and also had an opportunity to see the latest designs that were produced by architects of the Palladian movement. When he returned to New England, where he first settled in Newport, Rhode Island, he brought Palladianism with him. He designed notable buildings in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and influenced many more.\n Peter Harrison is now credited as the first professionally trained architect in America in the Palladian style. His known works in the British-American colonies are considered to be of the highest quality and the finest examples of Palladianism in his time.\n Many buildings are attributed to  Harrison, but only a few are fully documented as being his creations. These buildings are: the Redwood Library (1748\u201349), the Brick Market Building (1762\u201372), and the Touro Synagogue (1759) in Newport, Rhode Island; the King's Chapel (1749) in Boston, Massachusetts; and Christ Church, Cambridge (1759\u201360).\n Harrison married Elizabeth Pelham and later settled in New Haven, Connecticut. He was dedicated to Toryism and English culture. He was ruined by this affiliation during the turbulent years of the American Revolutionary War, when Tories were sometimes boycotted as local conditions turned. He died of a stroke at his home in New Haven in 1775.  He is buried in an unmarked grave at the New Haven Green.\n Soon after his death in 1775, his home was attacked by a mob of revolutionaries. They burned his library and all of his original drawings. This act of political violence destroyed the collection of one of the most erudite architects of the colonial period. It prevented the preparation of a catalogue of his designs for posterity.\n The Redwood Library built by Harrison in 1750, image copied with the permission of cardcow.com\n Touro Synagogue, America's first oldest surviving synagogue building\n 1853 picture of the Brick Market building, now home to the Museum of Newport History\n \n ", "tags": ["1716 births", "1775 deaths", "People from York", "American architects", "People of colonial Rhode Island", "Loyalists in the American Revolution from Connecticut", "Kingdom of England emigrants to the Thirteen Colonies", "Burials in Connecticut", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American architect\nPeter HarrisonMid-nineteenth century portrait of Harrison done from a Nathaniel Smibert original from 1756BornJune 14, 1716York, Yorkshire, EnglandDiedApril 30, 1775(1775-04-30) (aged\u00a058)New Haven, Connecticut, British AmericaNationalityBritishOccupationArchitectBuildingsThe Redwood Library, Touro Synagogue, King's Chapel (1749) in Boston, Massachusetts, Christ Church, Cambridge\n\nPeter Harrison (June 14, 1716 \u2013 April 30, 1775) was a colonial American architect in New England who is credited with bringing the Palladian architectural movement to the colonies.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Gallery\n4 References\n5 Further reading\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nBorn in York, England, Harrison immigrated to the colony of Rhode Island in 1740 with his brother Joseph Harrison.
