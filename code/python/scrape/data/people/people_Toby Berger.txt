{"name": "Toby Berger", "content": "Toby Berger (born September 4, 1940) is a noted American information theorist.\n Berger was born in New York City, to a Jewish family.[1] He received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Yale University in 1962, and doctoral degree in applied mathematics from Harvard University in 1968. From 1962-1968 he was also a senior scientist at Raytheon. From 1968-2005 he taught at Cornell University, and in 2006 joined the University of Virginia. His primary interests have been in information theory, random fields, communication networks, video compression, signature verification, coherent signal processing, and quantum information theory.\n Berger is a member of the National Academy of Engineering[2] an IEEE Fellow, a past president of the IEEE Information Theory Society, and a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Society for Engineering Education, Sigma Xi, and Tau Beta Pi. He received the 2002 Claude E. Shannon Award for his contributions to information theory, and the 2011 IEEE Richard W.
