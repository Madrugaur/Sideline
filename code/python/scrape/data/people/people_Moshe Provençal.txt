The halakhic debate quickly descended into a fierce and raging legal feud which eventually came to include halakhic giants from Safed and Thessaloniki. Proven\u00e7al spearheaded the rabbinic group arguing that Venturozzo's bill of divorce was invalid.[6] In 1566, Proven\u00e7al published a pamphlet making his case and arguing that the opposing rabbis did not follow proper judicial protocol.[7] By 1574, the debate was resolved, and the Italian rabbinate was reconciled.
