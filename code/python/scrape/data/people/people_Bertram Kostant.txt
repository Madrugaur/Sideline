{"name": "Bertram Kostant", "content": "Bertram Kostant (May 24, 1928 \u2013 February 2, 2017)[1] was an American mathematician who worked in representation theory, differential geometry, and mathematical physics.\n Kostant grew up in New York City, where he graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1945.[2]  He went on to obtain an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Purdue University in 1950. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1954, under the direction of Irving Segal, where he wrote a dissertation on representations of Lie groups.\n After time at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University, and the University of California, Berkeley, he joined the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he remained until his retirement in 1993. Kostant's work has involved  representation theory, Lie groups, Lie algebras, homogeneous spaces, differential geometry and mathematical physics, particularly symplectic geometry. He has given several lectures on the Lie group E8.[3] He has been one of the principal developers of the theory of geometric quantization. His introduction of the theory of prequantization has led to the theory of quantum Toda lattices. The Kostant partition function is named after him.  With Gerhard Hochschild and Alex F. T. W. Rosenberg, he is one of the namesakes of the Hochschild\u2013Kostant\u2013Rosenberg theorem which describes the Hochschild homology of some algebras.[4]\n His students include James Harris Simons, James Lepowsky, Moss Sweedler, David Vogan, and Birgit Speh. At present he has more than 100 mathematical descendants.\n Kostant's honors include election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1978.  In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[5] He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM with talk Orbits and quantization theory in 1970 at Nice.[6]\n ", "tags": ["1928 births", "2017 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Stuyvesant High School alumni", "Purdue University alumni", "University of Chicago alumni", "Princeton University faculty", "University of California, Berkeley faculty", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty", "People from Brooklyn", "Mathematicians from New York (state)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 maint: extra text: authors list", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nBertram KostantBertram Kostant at a workshop on \u201cEnveloping Algebras and Geometric Representation Theory\u201d in Oberwolfach, 2009Born(1928-05-24)May 24, 1928Brooklyn, New YorkDiedFebruary 2, 2017(2017-02-02) (aged\u00a088)Roslindale, MassachusettsNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materPurdue UniversityUniversity of Chicago (PhD)Known\u00a0forKostant partition function  Kostant\u2013Parthasarathy\u2013Ranga Rao\u2013Varadarajan determinantsAwardsWigner Medal (2016)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyUniversity of California, BerkeleyThesisRepresentations of a Lie algebra and its enveloping algebra on a Hilbert spaceDoctoral advisorIrving SegalDoctoral students\nMarjorie Batchelor\nJames Lepowsky\nArlie Petters\nStephen Rallis\nJames Harris Simons\nBirgit Speh\nMoss Sweedler\nDavid Vogan\n\n\nBertram Kostant (May 24, 1928 \u2013 February 2, 2017)[1] was an American mathematician who worked in representation theory, differential geometry, and mathematical physics.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career in mathematics\n3 Awards and honors\n4 Selected publications\n5 See also\n6 Notes\n7 References\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nKostant grew up in New York City, where he graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1945.[2]  He went on to obtain an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Purdue University in 1950.
