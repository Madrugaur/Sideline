He was the Chief Scientist of Australia from 1999 to 2006.\n Born in the Melbourne suburb of Brighton, Batterham graduated from the University of Melbourne in 1965 with a degree in chemical engineering, and received a PhD from the same institution in 1969. He received a scholarship from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to undertake postgraduate studies at the central research laboratories of ICI in the United Kingdom.[3] Batterham returned to Australia in 1970, and took up the position of chief scientist of the CSIRO's Division of Mineral Engineering, and was later promoted to division chief.[4]\n In 1999, he was appointed Chief Scientist of Australia, a role which he undertook simultaneously to acting as chief technologist for the multinational mining company Rio Tinto. Supporters of renewable energy technologies claimed that Batterham's employment by a mining company made his advice to the Prime Minister on climate change and geosequestration questionable, although Batterham assured his critics that his advice and work as Chief Scientist was neutral and not affected by his Rio Tinto position.[5] In 2004, concern was expressed over Dr. Batterham's dual roles, and a Senate committee found that there was a conflict of interest between the two, recommending that the Chief Scientist position be made full-time.[6] In May 2005, Batterham stepped down as Chief Scientist and took on a full-time position at Rio Tinto.[7]\n From May 2004 to May 2005, Batterham was President of the Institution of Chemical Engineers.[8]\n He was appointed an International Fellow[1] of the Royal Academy of Engineering[1] in 2004.\n He was appointed a Fellow (FTSE) of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) in 1988, and served as its President 2007\u20132012.[9]\n Batterham is the assistant organist at Scots' Church, Melbourne.[3][10] He has given numerous organ recitals, and has released several CDs.\n ", "tags": ["1941 births", "Living people", "Chief Scientists of Australia", "Australian chemical engineers", "Australian mining engineers", "Imperial Chemical Industries people", "Officers of the Order of Australia", "Recipients of the Centenary Medal", "University of Melbourne alumni", "Australian classical organists", "Male organists", "Fellows of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering", "Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science", "Foreign members of the Chinese Academy of Engineering", "21st-century Australian public servants", "21st-century Australian engineers", "20th-century Australian engineers", "21st-century organists", "21st-century Australian male musicians", "Use dmy dates from April 2018", "Use Australian English from April 2018", "All Wikipedia articles written in Australian English", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\n Robin Batterham, 2005\nRobin John Batterham AO FREng[1] FAA FTSE[2] (born 3 April 1941) is an Australian scientist specialising in chemical engineering.
