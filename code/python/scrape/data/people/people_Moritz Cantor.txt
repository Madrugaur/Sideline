{"name": "Moritz Cantor", "content": "Moritz Benedikt Cantor (23 August 1829 \u2013 10 April 1920) was a German historian of mathematics.\n Cantor was born at Mannheim.

In his early youth, Moritz Cantor was not strong enough to go to school, and his parents decided to educate him at home. Later, however, he was admitted to an advanced class of the Gymnasium in Mannheim.
