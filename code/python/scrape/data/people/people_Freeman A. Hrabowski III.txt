{"name": "Freeman A. Hrabowski III", "content": "Freeman Alphonsa Hrabowski III (born August 13, 1950) is an American educator, advocate, and mathematician. In May 1992 he began his term as president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC),[1] one of the twelve public universities composing the University System of Maryland.[2] Hrabowski has been credited with transforming UMBC into an institution noted for research and innovation.[3] Under his leadership, UMBC was ranked the #1 Up and Coming University in the U.S. for six consecutive years (2009-2014) by U.S. News and World Report magazine.[4] When that designation was retired, U.S. News and World Report began including UMBC on its annual Most Innovative National Universities list.[5]\n Hrabowski is the co-author of the books Beating the Odds: Raising Academically Successful African American Males (1998); Overcoming the Odds: Raising Academically Successful African American Young Women (2001); Holding Fast to Dreams:  Empowering Youth from the Civil Rights Crusade to STEM (2015); and The Empowered University: Shared Leadership, Culture Change, and Academic Success (2019).[6]\n His research and many publications focus on science and math education, with a special emphasis on minority participation and performance. His leadership, expertise and vision are  integral to programs worldwide in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are used by universities, school systems, and community groups around the country.[7]\n Hrabowski chaired the National Academies committee that produced the report Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation: America's Science and Technology Talent at the Crossroads.[8] In 2012, President Barack Obama appointed Hrabowski to Chair of the newly created President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for African Americans.[9] Publications have named him one of America's Best Leaders,[10] one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World,[11] and one of America's 10 Best College Presidents.[12]\n In 2011, Hrabowski received the Carnegie Corporation of New York's Academic Leadership Award, one of the highest honors given to an educator. The award included a $500,000 grant, which he has directed to support and promote a culture of innovation, entrepreneurship, and student success at UMBC.[13]\n Hrabowski was born in segregated Birmingham, Alabama, the only child of his parents, both of whom were educators.[14]   His mother was an English teacher who decided to become a math teacher, and she used the young Hrabowski as a guinea pig at home.  His father had been a math teacher and then went to work at a steel mill because, as Hrabowski is quoted as saying, \"frankly, he could make more money doing that.\"[failed verification] Frequently asked about the origin of his unusual surname, Hrabowski explains that he is the great-great-grandson of Eaton Hrabowski, a slave owned by and named for slave owner Samuel Hrabowski.[15] In a CBS television interview, Hrabowski recounted that he is the third Freeman Hrabowski;  his grandfather was the first Freeman Hrabowski born a free man, as opposed to having to be freed.[16]\n When he was 12 years old, in 1963, Hrabowski saw his friends readying for the Children's Crusade march for civil rights.  He convinced his parents to let him join in as a youth advocate, but soon into the march he was swept up in a mass arrest.  Birmingham's notorious Public Safety Commissioner Eugene \"Bull\" Connor spat in his face and arrested him.[17]  The jail guards locked even the youngest freedom marchers in with hardened criminals. Hrabowski spent five terrified days and nights shielding other youngsters and comforting them by reading his Bible aloud or singing songs.  After being reunited with the adults, Hrabowski remembers Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. telling them, \"What you do this day will have an impact on generations as yet unborn.\"  King's words resonated with Hrabowski, and ultimately rang true as the national outrage at the brutality against Birmingham children helped build the pressure for laws banning racial discrimination. That outcome gave Hrabowski a life mission, and he has since been a staunch and tireless campaigner for equality, education, and excellence. \n When he was 19 years old, Hrabowski graduated from Hampton Institute with high honors in mathematics. During his matriculation there he spent a year abroad at the American University in Cairo, Egypt. At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he received his M.A. in mathematics and four years later his Ph.D. in higher education administration and statistics. Much of his work focuses on ensuring students of all backgrounds continue to be amongst the graduates from STEM programs.[16][18]\n UMBC was a relatively young school in a Baltimore suburb when Hrabowski arrived in 1987 as Vice Provost, then Executive Vice President, and President in 1992.[19]\n Over nearly three decades as president of UMBC, Hrabowski gained a high public profile.[20] Hrabowski emphasized STEM education, and co-founded the Meyerhoff Scholars, aimed at promoting minority achievement in STEM fields.[20] Under his leadership, \"more black students earn bachelor's degrees in science and technology from UMBC than from any other non-historically black university in Maryland, even College Park, which has three times as many students.\"[20] Hrabowski was an advisor to President Barack Obama on higher education policy, and was appointed by Obama to serve as chair of an advisory council on excellence in African-American education. He received an honorary doctorate from Harvard University in 2010.[20]\n Hrabowski has received, among other awards:\n *Interim\n ", "tags": ["1950 births", "Living people", "Activists from Birmingham, Alabama", "Presidents of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County", "Hampton University alumni", "University of Illinois alumni", "African-American academics", "Urban Institute people", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with peacock terms from March 2021", "All articles with peacock terms", "All articles with failed verification", "Articles with failed verification from March 2018", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American academic administrator (born 1950)\nThis article contains wording that promotes the subject in a subjective manner without imparting real information.
