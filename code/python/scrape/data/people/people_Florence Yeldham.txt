{"name": "Florence Yeldham", "content": "\n Florence Annie Yeldham (30 October 1877 \u2013 10 January 1945)[1] was a British school teacher and historian of arithmetic. She supported the idea of following the history of mathematics as a motive to teach arithmetic.[1]\n Florence Yeldham was born at School House, Brightling, Battle, East Sussex, on 30 October 1877, the daughter of school teacher Thomas Yeldham, who later became a school inspector, and his wife, Elizabeth Ann Chesterfield. She was the second daughter and second of at least seven children. She was not originally from London but moved there from Sussex and studied in James Allen's Girls' School, Dulwich.[1]\n James Allen's Girls' School awarded her an exhibition to go to Bedford College, University of London, from where she matriculated in 1895. Yeldham graduated with a BSc (division two) in 1900, having chosen papers in pure mathematics, experimental physics, and zoology. Whilst she is listed as having gained honours, which one would have expected, no details have been found.[1]\n Although she did not enjoy a remarkable teaching career, Yeldham wrote books herself.
