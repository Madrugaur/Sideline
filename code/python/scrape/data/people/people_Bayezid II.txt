{"name": "Bayezid II", "content": "Bayezid II (Ottoman Turkish: \u0628\u0627\u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u062b\u0627\u0646\u0649\u200e, romanized:\u00a0B\u0101yez\u012bd-i s\u0331\u0101n\u012b, December 1447 \u2013 26 May 1512, Turkish: II. Bayezid) was the eldest son and successor of Mehmed II, ruling as Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1481 to 1512. During his reign, Bayezid II consolidated the Ottoman Empire and thwarted a Safavid rebellion soon before abdicating his throne to his son, Selim I. He is most notable for evacuating Sephardi Jews from Spain after the proclamation of the Alhambra Decree, and resettling them throughout Ottoman lands, especially in Salonica.\n Bayezid II was the son of Mehmed II (1432\u20131481) and G\u00fclbahar Hatun. \n There are sources that claim that Bayezid was the son of M\u00fckrime Hatun.[3] This would make Ay\u015fe Hatun a first cousin of Bayezid II. However, the marriage of M\u00fckrime Hatun took place two years after Bayezid was born[4] and the whole arrangement was not to Mehmed's liking.[5] G\u00fclbahar Hatun is generally accepted as the real mother of Bayezid II.[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]\n Born in Demotika, Bayezid II was educated in Amasya and later served there as a bey for 27 years. In 1473, he fought in the Battle of Otlukbeli against the Aq Qoyunlu.\n Bayezid II married G\u00fclbahar Hatun, who was the mother of Bayezid II's successor, Selim I and nephew of Sitti\u015fah Hatun.\n Bayezid II's overriding concern was the quarrel with his brother Cem Sultan, who claimed the throne and sought military backing from the Mamluks in Egypt. Having been defeated by his brother's armies, Cem sought protection from the Knights of St. John in Rhodes. Eventually, the Knights handed Cem over to Pope Innocent VIII (1484\u20131492). The Pope thought of using Cem as a tool to drive the Turks out of Europe, but as the papal crusade failed to come to fruition, Cem was left to languish and die in a Neapolitan prison.\n Bayezid II ascended the Ottoman throne in 1481.[14] Like his father, Bayezid II was a patron of western and eastern culture. Unlike many other sultans, he worked hard to ensure a smooth running of domestic politics, which earned him the epithet of \"the Just\". Throughout his reign, Bayezid II engaged in numerous campaigns to conquer the Venetian possessions in Morea, accurately defining this region as the key to future Ottoman naval power in the Eastern Mediterranean. The last of these wars ended in 1501 with Bayezid II in control of the whole Peloponnese. Rebellions in the east, such as that of the Qizilbash, plagued much of Bayezid II's reign and were often backed by the shah of Persia, Ismail I, who was eager to promote Shi'ism to undermine the authority of the Ottoman state. Ottoman authority in Anatolia was indeed seriously threatened during this period and at one point Bayezid II's vizier, Had\u0131m Ali Pasha, was killed in battle against the \u015eahkulu rebellion.\n In July 1492, the new state of Spain expelled its Jewish and Muslim populations as part of the Spanish Inquisition. Bayezid II sent out the Ottoman Navy under the command of admiral Kemal Reis to Spain in 1492 in order to evacuate them safely to Ottoman lands. He sent out proclamations throughout the empire that the refugees were to be welcomed.[15] He granted the refugees the permission to settle in the Ottoman Empire and become Ottoman citizens. He ridiculed the conduct of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in expelling a class of people so useful to their subjects. \"You venture to call Ferdinand a wise ruler,\" he said to his courtiers, \"he who has impoverished his own country and enriched mine!\"[16] Bayezid addressed a firman to all the governors of his European provinces, ordering them not only to refrain from repelling the Spanish refugees, but to give them a friendly and welcome reception.[16] He threatened with death all those who treated the Jews harshly or refused them admission into the empire. Moses Capsali, who probably helped to arouse the sultan's friendship for the Jews, was most energetic in his assistance to the exiles. He made a tour of the communities and was instrumental in imposing a tax upon the rich, to ransom the Jewish victims of the persecution.\n The Muslims and Jews of al-Andalus contributed much to the rising power of the Ottoman Empire by introducing new ideas, methods and craftsmanship. The first printing press in Constantinople (now Istanbul) was established by the Sephardic Jews in 1493. It is reported that under Bayezid's reign, Jews enjoyed a period of cultural flourishing, with the presence of such scholars as the Talmudist and scientist Mordecai Comtino; astronomer and poet Solomon ben Elijah Sharbi\u1e6d ha-Zahab; Shabbethai ben Malkiel Cohen, and the liturgical poet Menahem Tamar.\n During Bayezid II's final years, on 14 September 1509, Constantinople was devastated by an earthquake,[17][18] and a succession battle developed between his sons Selim and Ahmet. Ahmet unexpectedly captured Karaman, and began marching to Constantinople to exploit his triumph. Fearing for his safety, Selim staged a revolt in Thrace but was defeated by Bayezid and forced to flee back to the Crimean Peninsula. Bayezid II developed fears that Ahmet might in turn kill him to gain the throne, so he refused to allow his son to enter Constantinople.\n When Selim returned from Crimea and, with support from the Janissaries, he forced his father to abdicate the throne on 25 April 1512. Bayezid departed for retirement in his native Dimetoka, but he died on 26 May 1512 at Havsa, before reaching his destination and only a month after his abdication. He was buried next to the Bayezid Mosque in Istanbul.\n Bayezid was praised in a ghazal of Abd\u00fcrrezzak Bah\u015f\u0131, a scribe who came to Constantinople from Samarkand in the second half of the 15th century that worked at the courts of Mehmed II and Bayezid II, and wrote in Chagatai with the Old Uyghur alphabet:[19][20]\n I had a pleasant time in your reign my Padishah.\n I was without fear of all fears and dangers.\n \nThe fame of your justice and fairness reached to China and Hotan.\n Thanks to God that there exist a merciful person like my Padishah.\n \nSultan Bayezid Khan ascended the throne.\n This country had been his fate since past eternity.\n \nAny enemy that denied the country of my master:\n That enemy's neck had been in rope and gallows.\n \nYour believing servants' faces smile like Bah\u015f\u0131's.\n The place of those who walk unbelieving is hellfire.\n Bayezid had seven consorts:\n Bayezid had eight sons:\n Bayezid had eleven daughters:\n ", "tags": ["1447 births", "1512 deaths", "15th-century caliphs", "15th-century Ottoman sultans", "16th-century Ottoman sultans", "Burials in Turkey", "Monarchs who abdicated", "Ottoman dynasty", "People from Didymoteicho", "Pages with non-numeric formatnum arguments", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles containing Ottoman Turkish (1500-1928)-language text", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia without a Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1481 to 1512\nKayser-i R\u00fbm\nBayezid II\u0628\u0627\u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u062b\u0627\u0646\u0649Kayser-i R\u00fbm18th century portrait of Bayezid IISultan of the Ottoman Empire (Padishah)Reign22 May 1481 \u2013 24 April 1512 (30\u00a0years, 338\u00a0days)PredecessorMehmed IISuccessorSelim IBorn3 December 1447Demotika, Ottoman Sultanate  (modern-day Demotika, Greece)Died26 May 1512(1512-05-26) (aged\u00a064)Abalar, Havsa, Ottoman EmpireBurialBayezid II Mosque, IstanbulConsorts\u015eirin HatunH\u00fcsn\u00fc\u015fah HatunB\u00fclb\u00fcl HatunNigar HatunG\u00fclruh HatunG\u00fclbahar Valide HatunFerah\u015fad HatunIssue\u015eehzade Sultan Ahmed\u015eehzade Sultan KorkudSelim IAyn\u0131\u015fah HatunAy\u015fe HatunNamesBayezid bin MehmedDynastyOttomanFatherMehmed IIMotherG\u00fclbahar Hatun[1][2]ReligionSunni IslamTughra\nBayezid II (Ottoman Turkish: \u0628\u0627\u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u062b\u0627\u0646\u0649\u200e, romanized:\u00a0B\u0101yez\u012bd-i s\u0331\u0101n\u012b, December 1447 \u2013 26 May 1512, Turkish: II.

In the game, due to Bayezid's absence from Constantinople, the Byzantines had the opportunity to sneak back into the city, hoping to revive their fallen empire. Near the end of the game, Bayezid surrendered the throne to his son Selim. However, Bayezid does not make an actual appearance.\nBayezid II, prior to becoming Sultan, is depicted by Akin Gazi in the Starz series, Da Vinci's Demons. He seeks an audience with Pope Sixtus IV (having been manipulated into believing that peace between Rome and Constantinople is a possibility), only to be ridiculed and humiliated by Sixtus, actions which later serve as a pretext for the Ottoman invasion of Otranto. Sixtus assumes that Bayezid has been overlooked in favor of his brother Cem.\nReferences[edit]\nNotes\n\n\n^ Necdet Sakao\u011flu (2008).
