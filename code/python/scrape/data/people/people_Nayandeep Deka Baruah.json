He graduated with a masters in mathematics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK), India in 1995 and a Ph.D in mathematics from Tezpur University, India in 2001.[2] The title of his Ph.D. thesis was Contributions to Ramanujan's Schlafli-type Modular Equations, Class Invariants, Theta-functions, and Continued Fractions.[3] Following a short stint at Assam University, Silchar, Baruah has been a member of the faculty at Tezpur since 1997,[4] becoming full professor in 2009.
