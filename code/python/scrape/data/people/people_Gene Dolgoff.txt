{"name": "Gene Dolgoff", "content": "\n Gene (Eugene) Dolgoff (born 1950) is the founder, CEO, and CTO of HOLOBEAM TECHNOLOGIES INC., which is developing new technologies for diagnosing diseases using advanced medical imaging and for improving treatment. The main technologies being developed, which are patent pending, are Holographic Energy Teleportation (HET), Advanced Nanoparticles, and a new type of MRI diagnostic imaging system.\n Before going to City College  he began his work in optical physics at George Washington High School\n At the City College of the City University of New York, he majored in physics, mathematics, and electrical engineering, and minored in physiological-psychology, as well as teaching a course (which he authored) in optics, lasers, and holography for three years. He also studied computer science, geometry, and astronomy at Columbia University in New York.\n Dolgoff's mother was a Lithuanian refugee and was held at Stutthof, Dachau, and Auschwitz Nazi concentration camps during WW II. After the war and her emigration to the US, she tried to recover funds her father said to have deposited at Swiss and other banks. She was unsuccessful, so her son Eugene continued the inquiries after her death.[1]\n Dolgoff was an early developer of digital projection and started experimenting and thinking about LCD projectors in 1968[citation needed]. He founded Projectavision Inc., the world's first dedicated digital projection company in 1988 (listed on NASDAQ in 1990).[2] With funding from DARPA, he worked on the development of the U.S. HDTV system. He has published several papers in 3-D imaging, optics, holography, the brain, and LCD video projection, and has more than 65 patents granted worldwide with others pending. In 2018 Dolgoff filed a patent application for Holographic Energy Teleportation and became CEO of Holobeam Technologies Inc.[3]\n In an interview on the 74th episode of the netcast \"Home Theater Geeks\", Dolgoff shared with host Scott Wilkinson how he was the one who suggested the Holodeck idea to Gene Roddenberry and how the two worked to define the parameters of the concept, which was used in Star Trek: The Next Generation, and other spinoffs. Dolgoff also suggested to Roddenberry that all the controls on the ship should be holographic, but Roddenberry could not see how that could be conveyed to the viewer, so that idea was not used until recently in the new series called Star Trek Discovery.
