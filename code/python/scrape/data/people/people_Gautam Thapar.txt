However, Brij Mohan passed on the chance to his younger brother Lalit Mohan Thapar, giving lack of desire and inability to shoulder the responsibility as the reasons.[2] Thapar was educated at The Doon School. He later studied chemical engineering at Pratt Institute in the United States. After failing to find a suitable job and US visa nearing expiry, he returned to India.[2]\n Thapar had responsibility to turn around the BILT's chemical division, which was suffering losses due to management-labour conflicts and shortage of water and power.[when?] Gautam showed profits within a year, by scrapping the company's expansion plans, selling off a few assets and trying to resolve labour concerns.[2] The family's assets were divided into four in 1999, with Gautam's older brother Karan parting ways in 2005. Gautam became the Chairman of Crompton Greaves on 22 July 2004.[3]\n When Lalit Mohan Thapar retired, he chose his nephew Gautam over Vikram.[4] In 2005, Lalit Mohan handed over the reins of the business empire to Gautam along with his voting rights, shares and most of his personal effects in his will. Gautam became the Chairman of the Group on 1 July 2006.[1]\n On 29 August 2019, he was sacked as Chairman of CG Power and Industrial Solutions with immediate effect after an investigation that unearthed a multi crore financial scam at the firm.
