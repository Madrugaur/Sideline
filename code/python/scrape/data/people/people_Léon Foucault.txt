He also made an early measurement of the speed of light, discovered eddy currents, and is credited with naming the gyroscope.\n The son of a publisher, Foucault was born in Paris on 18 September 1819. After an education received chiefly at home, he studied medicine, which he abandoned in favour of physics due to a blood phobia.[1] He first directed his attention to the improvement of Louis Daguerre's photographic processes. For three years he was experimental assistant to Alfred Donn\u00e9 (1801\u20131878) in his course of lectures on microscopic anatomy.\n With Hippolyte Fizeau he carried out a series of investigations on the intensity of the light of the sun, as compared with that of carbon in the arc lamp, and of lime in the flame of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe; on the interference of infrared radiation, and of light rays differing greatly in lengths of path; and on the chromatic polarization of light.\n In 1849, Foucault experimentally demonstrated that absorption and emission lines appearing at the same wavelength are both due to the same material, with the difference between the two originating from the temperature of the light source.[2][3]\n In 1850, he did an experiment using the Fizeau\u2013Foucault apparatus to measure the speed of light; it came to be known as the Foucault\u2013Fizeau experiment, and was viewed as \"driving the last nail in the coffin\" of Newton's corpuscular theory of light when it showed that light travels more slowly through water than through air.[4]\nIn 1851, he provided an experimental demonstration of the rotation of the Earth on its axis (diurnal motion). This experimental setup had been used by Vincenzo Viviani but became well known to the public by Foucault's work. Foucault achieved the demonstration by showing the rotation of the plane of oscillation of a long and heavy pendulum suspended from the roof of the Panth\u00e9on, Paris. The experiment caused a sensation in both the learned and popular worlds, and \"Foucault pendulums\" were suspended in major cities across Europe and America and attracted crowds. In the following year he used (and named) the gyroscope as a conceptually simpler experimental proof. In 1855, he received the Copley Medal of the Royal Society for his 'very remarkable experimental researches'. Earlier in the same year he was made physicien (physicist) at the imperial observatory at Paris.\n In September 1855 he discovered that the force required for the rotation of a copper disc becomes greater when it is made to rotate with its rim between the poles of a magnet, the disc at the same time becoming heated by the eddy current or \"Foucault currents\" induced in the metal.\n In 1857 Foucault invented the polarizer which bears his name,[5] and in the succeeding year devised a method of testing the mirror of a reflecting telescope to determine its shape.[6][7]  The so-called \"Foucault knife-edge test\" allows the worker to tell if the mirror is perfectly spherical or has non-spherical deviation in its figure.  Prior to Foucault's publication of his findings, the testing of reflecting telescope mirrors was a \"hit or miss\" proposition.\n Foucault's knife edge test determines the shape of a mirror by finding the focal lengths of its areas, commonly called zones and measured from the mirror center. In the test, light from a point source is focused onto the center of curvature of the mirror and reflected back to a knife edge. The test enables the tester to quantify the conic section of the mirror, thereby allowing the tester to validate the actual shape of the mirror, which is necessary to obtain optimal performance of the optical system. The Foucault test is in use to this date, most notably by amateur and smaller commercial telescope makers as it is inexpensive and uses simple, easily made equipment.\n With Charles Wheatstone\u2019s revolving mirror he, in 1862, determined the speed of light to be 298,000 km/s \u2013 10,000\u00a0km/s less than that obtained by previous experimenters and only 0.6% in error of the currently accepted value.\n In 1862 Foucault was made a member of the Bureau des Longitudes and an officer of the Legion of Honour. He became a member of the Royal Society of London in 1864, and  member of the mechanical section of the Institute a year later. In 1865 he published his papers on a modification of James Watt's centrifugal governor; he had for some time been experimenting with a view to making its period of revolution constant and developing a new apparatus for regulating the electric light. Foucault showed how, by the deposition of a transparently thin film of silver on the outer side of the object glass of a telescope, the sun could be viewed without injuring the eye. His chief scientific papers are to be found in the Comptes Rendus, 1847\u20131869. Near his death he returned to Roman Catholicism that he previously abandoned.[8]\n Foucault died of what was probably a rapidly developing case of multiple sclerosis[9] on 11 February 1868 in Paris and was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.\n The asteroid 5668 Foucault was named for him.[10] His is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.\n Collected Works:\n ", "tags": ["1819 births", "1868 deaths", "Burials at Montmartre Cemetery", "Deaths from multiple sclerosis", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "19th-century physicists", "French physicists", "French Roman Catholics", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Optical physicists", "Recipients of the Copley Medal", "Articles incorporating a citation from the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia without Wikisource reference", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DSI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French physicist\nL\u00e9on FoucaultPhotograph by Bertall & CieBornJean Bernard L\u00e9on Foucault18 September 1819Paris, FranceDied11 February 1868(1868-02-11) (aged\u00a048)Paris, FranceResting placeMontmartre CemeteryNationalityFrenchAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ParisKnown\u00a0forFoucault pendulumFoucault's currentsFoucault knife-edge testFizeau\u2013Foucault apparatusGyroscopeCatadioptric systemsSilvering processAwardsCopley Medal (1855)Scientific careerFieldsPhysicsInstitutionsParis Observatory\n\nJean Bernard L\u00e9on Foucault (UK: /\u0292\u0252\u0303 \u02c8b\u025b\u0259rn\u0251\u02d0r \u02ccle\u026a\u0252\u0303 \u02c8fu\u02d0ko\u028a/ FOO-koh, US: /\u02cc\u0292\u0252\u0303 b\u025b\u0259r\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0r le\u026a\u02cc\u0252\u0303 fu\u02d0\u02c8ko\u028a/ foo-KOH, French:\u00a0[\u0292\u0251\u0303 b\u025b\u0281na\u0281 le\u0254\u0303 fuko]; 18 September 1819 \u2013 11 February 1868) was a French physicist best known for his demonstration of the Foucault pendulum, a device demonstrating the effect of the Earth's rotation.
