He also published numerous papers on various cultural topics: poetics, linguistics, semiotics, philosophy, and history of science and education.\n He was born in Bac\u0103u, Romania, to Sima and Alter Marcus, a Jewish family of tailors.[1] From an early age he had to live through dictatorships, war, infringements on free speech and free thinking as well as anti-Semitism.[2] At the age of 16 or 17 he started tutoring younger pupils in order to help his family financially.[2]\n He graduated from Ferdinand I High School in 1944, and completed his studies at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Science, Department of Mathematics, in 1949. He continued tutoring throughout college and later recounted in an interview that he had to endure hunger during those years and that till the age of 20 he only wore hand-me-downs from his older brothers.[2]\n Marcus obtained his PhD in Mathematics in 1956, with a thesis on the Monotonic functions of two variables, written under the direction of Miron Nicolescu.[3] He was appointed Lecturer in 1955, Associate Professor in 1964, and became a Professor in 1966 (Emeritus in 1991).\n Marcus has contributed to the following areas:\n Marcus published about 50 books, which have been translated into English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Greek, Hungarian, Czech, Serbo-Croatian, and about 400 research articles in specialized journals in almost all European countries, in the United States, Canada, South America, Japan, India, and New Zealand among others; he is cited by more than a thousand authors, including mathematicians, computer scientists, linguists, literary researchers, semioticians,anthropologists and philosophers.\n He is recognised[4][5][6] as one of the initiators of mathematical linguistics and of mathematical poetics, and has been a member of the editorial board of tens of international scientific journals covering\nall his domains of interest.\n Marcus is featured in the 1999 book People and Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science.[7] and the 2015 The Human Face of Computing .[8]\nA collection of his papers in English followed by some interviews and a brief autobiography was published in 2007 as Words and Languages Everywhere.[9]\n The book  \"Meetings with Solomon Marcus\" (Spandugino Publishing House, Bucharest, Romania, 2010, 1500 pages), edited by Lavinia Spandonide and Gheorghe P\u0103un for Marcus' 85th birthday, includes recollections by several hundred people from a large variety of scientific and cultural fields, and from 25 countries.
