An avid weaver, Dietz drew upon her experience as a former math teacher to devise a threading pattern based on a cubic binomial expansion.  She describes her idea as follows:\n\n\"Taking the cube of a binomial [ (x + y)3], I approached [the pattern] in the way applied algebraic problems are approached - by letting x equal one unknown and y equal the other unknown.\n\"In this case, x equaled the first and second harnesses, and y equaled the third and fourth harnesses.  Then it was simply a matter of expanding the cube of the binomial and substituting the values of x and y to write the threading draft.\" (Dietz, 1949)\nA piece based on the formula (a + b + c + d + e + f)2, submitted to the Little Loomhouse Country Fair in Louisville, Kentucky received such a positive response, which prompted a collaboration between Dietz and Little Loomhouse's founder, Lou Tate.  The fruits of the collaboration included the booklet Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles and a traveling exhibit which continued throughout the 1950s.\n\nSee also[edit]\nMathematics and fiber arts\nReferences[edit]\nDietz, Ada K.
