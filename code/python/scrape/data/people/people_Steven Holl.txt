{"name": "Steven Holl", "content": "Steven Holl (born December 9, 1947) is a New York-based American architect and watercolorist. Among his most recognized works are the 2019 REACH expansion of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts,[1] the 2019 Hunters Point Library in Queens, New York,[2] the 2007 Bloch Building addition to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri,[3] and the 2009 Linked Hybrid mixed-use complex in Beijing, China.[3]\n Holl was born on December 9, 1947, and grew up in Bremerton and Manchester, Washington.[4] Holl graduated from the University of Washington College of Architecture and Urban Planning.\n Holl's architecture has undergone a shift in emphasis, from his earlier concern with Typology to his more modern style of phenomenology. He has been inspired and influenced by philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty and architect-theorist Juhani Pallasmaa.\n In 1998, Holl was awarded the prestigious Alvar Aalto Medal. In 2000, Holl was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In July 2001, Time named Holl America's Best Architect, for \"buildings that satisfy the spirit as well as the eye.\" Other awards and distinctions include the best architectural design in New York for The Pace Collection showroom in 1986 from the American Institute of Architects, the New York American Institute of Architects Medal of Honor (1997), the French Grande M\u00e9daille d\u2019Or (2001), the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Award in Architecture (2002), Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (2003), the Arnold W. Brunner Prize in Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the 2008 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Arts category.[5]  In 2007, Steven Holl Architects received the AIA Institute Honor Award and the AIA New York Chapter Architecture Merit Award for Art Building West for the School of Art and Art History (University of Iowa, Iowa City). The Higgins Hall Insertion at Pratt Institute (Brooklyn, New York) and the New Residence at the Swiss Embassy both received the AIA New York Chapter Architecture Honor Award in 2007. In 2010, Herning Museum of Contemporary Art, (Herning, Denmark) was awarded the RIBA International Award. The Horizontal Skyscraper-Vanke Center received the 2011 AIA Institute National Honor Award, as well as the AIA NY Honor Award. In 2011, he was named a Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council.,[6] and Holl was named the 2012 AIA Gold Medal winner.[7] In 2014, Holl was awarded the Praemium Imperiale Prize for Architecture.[8] In 2016, Holl\n Holl is a tenured professor at Columbia University, where he has taught since 1981[9] with Dimitra Tsachrelia.[10] He frequently teaches on the relationship between music and architecture.[11]\n In 2010, Holl founded 'T' Space, a multidisciplinary arts organization in Rhinebeck, New York. The core aim of 'T' Space is to create educational fusions of art, architecture, music, and poetry of the 21st century. The organization operates a summer exhibition series and an emerging architects summer residency in pursuit of their mission.[12]\n The 'T' Space Synthesis of the Arts Series explores the intersection of art, architecture, and ecology through 2 to 3 exhibitions of work by emerging and established artists and architects. As of its 2019 season, 'T' Space has exhibited architects Jos\u00e9 Oubrerie, Tatiana Bilbao, and Neil Denari,[13] as well as artists such as Ai Weiwei, Pat Steir, and Brice Marden.[14]\n In 2017, 'T' Space began offering a summertime residency program for young architects and artists.[15] Program participants design purpose-built architecture for rural communities, with curriculum emphasizing the ecological outcomes of design. During project development, the residents participate in pin-ups, field trips, and a public lecture series, from architects including Christian Wassmann, Christoph Kumpusch, Tamas Nagy, and Holl himself.[16][17]\n In addition to its arts and educational programming, 'T' Space maintains a publication program and a 30-acre nature reserve with outdoor installations of art and architecture. In 2019, construction was completed on 'T' Space's architectural archive and research library, which will come to house Holl's work as a watercolorist, as well as models, drawings and other architectural materials developed in Holl's 40-plus years as principal of Steven Holl Architects.[18]\n Holl won first prize in the Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek International Library Design Competition in 1988, an expansion and renovation of the \nAmerican Memorial Library in Berlin. In February, 1989 Holl's work was exhibited in a solo show at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City.  MoMA later purchased twenty-five works by Holl for the museum's permanent collection. In the 1992 competition for a new contemporary arts museum in Helsinki, Finland, Holl's entry, entitled \"Chiasma,\" won first prize out of more than five hundred international entries.  The museum opened to the public in 1998, having permanently adopted the name \"Kiasma,\" the Finnish translitteration of \"chiasma.\"\n In designing the Chapel of St. Ignatius (built 1994-1997), Jesuit chapel at Seattle University, Holl addressed the campus's need for green space by siting the chapel in the center of a former street and elongating the building plan. New green campus quadrangles were formed to the north, west, and south, and a future quadrangle is planned to the east.[19] The plan of the chapel won a design award in the American Institute of Architects of New York. Holl designed the Chapel around St. Ignatius's vision of the inner spiritual life, \"seven bottles of light in a stone box\", by creating seven volumes of different light. Each volume represents a different part of Jesuit Catholic worship, and has differently colored glass so that various parts of the building are marked out by colored light. Light sources are tinted both in this way and by indirect reflection from painted surfaces, and each is paired with its complementary color.\n Along with Pallasmaa and Alberto Perez-Gomez, Holl wrote essays for a 1994 special issue of the Japanese architectural journal A+U under the title \"Questions of Perception: Phenomenology of Architecture.\" The publication was reissued as a book in 2006.\n ", "tags": ["Steven Holl buildings", "1947 births", "Living people", "20th-century American architects", "Postmodern architects", "Members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters", "University of Washington alumni", "Columbia University faculty", "Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation faculty", "People from Bremerton, Washington", "Alumni of the Architectural Association School of Architecture", "Architects from New York (state)", "21st-century American architects", "Architects from Washington (state)", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from January 2018", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Steven HollSteven Holl in 2008Born (1947-12-09) December 9, 1947 (age\u00a073)Bremerton, WashingtonNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of WashingtonArchitectural Association School of ArchitectureOccupationArchitectAwardsAlvar Aalto Medal (1998)  BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award (2008) AIA Gold Medal (2012)  Praemium Imperiale (2014)  The Daylight and Building Component Award (2016)PracticeSteven Holl ArchitectsBuildingsKiasma Contemporary Art Museum, Helsinki, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Linked Hybrid, Beijing, Knut Hamsun Center, Hamar\u00f8y, Norway\n\nSteven Holl (born December 9, 1947) is a New York-based American architect and watercolorist.
