His work was carried out in wartime England in the 1940s, while employed at the de Havilland Aircraft company. \n Moyal was a professor of mathematics at the former School of Mathematics and Physics of Macquarie University,[6] where he was a colleague of John Clive Ward.  Previously, he had worked at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois.[2]\n He published pioneering work on stochastic processes.[1]\n Moyal was married to Susanna Pollack (1912-2000), with whom he had two children, Orah Young (born in Tel Aviv) and David Moyal (born in Belfast).
