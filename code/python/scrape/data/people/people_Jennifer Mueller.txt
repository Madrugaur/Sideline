{"name": "Jennifer Mueller", "content": "Jennifer L. Mueller is an applied mathematician and biomedical engineer whose research concerns inverse problems and their applications, particularly to problems in medical imaging related to electrical impedance tomography.[1][2] She is a professor of mathematics at Colorado State University, where she also holds a joint appointment in the school of biomedical engineering and the department of electrical and computer engineering.\n Mueller completed a Ph.D. in 1997 at the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln. Her dissertation, Inverse Problems in Singular Differential Equations, was supervised by Thomas S. Shores.[3] After postdoctoral research at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute she joined the Colorado State Mathematics Department in 2000, and became a founding member of the School of Biomedical Engineering in 2007.
