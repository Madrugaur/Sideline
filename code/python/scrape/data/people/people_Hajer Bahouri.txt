{"name": "Hajer Bahouri", "content": "Hajer Bahouri (born 30 March 1958 in Tunis) is a Franco-Tunisian mathematician who is interested in partial differential equations. She is Director of Research at the National Center for Scientific Research and the Laboratory of Analysis and Applied Mathematics at the University Paris-Est-Cr\u00e9teil-Val-de-Marne.\n From 1977, Bahouri studied mathematics at the University of Tunis, graduating in 1979; she then received the President's Award. She studied in Paris and obtained a Master of Advanced Studies in 1980 at the University Paris-Sud and a doctorate in 1982, under the direction of Serge Alinhac, with a thesis entitled Uniqueness and non-uniqueness of the Cauchy problem for real symbol operators.[1] Then she devoted herself to research at \u00c9cole Polytechnique; from 1984 to 1988, she was a lecturer at the University of Paris-Sud and Rennes-I.
