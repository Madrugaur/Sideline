{"name": "Gwilym Jenkins", "content": "\n Gwilym Meirion Jenkins (12 August 1932 \u2013 10 July 1982) was a British statistician and systems engineer, born in Gowerton (Welsh: Treg\u0175yr), Swansea, Wales.[1] He is most notable for his pioneering work with George Box on autoregressive moving average models, also called Box\u2013Jenkins models, in time-series analysis.\n He earned a first class honours degree in mathematics in 1953 followed by a Ph.D. at University College London in 1956. After graduating, he married Margaret Bellingham and together they raised three children. His first job after university was junior fellow at the Royal Aircraft Establishment. He followed this by a series of visiting lecturer and professor positions at Imperial College London, Stanford University, Princeton University, and the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, before settling in as a professor of Systems Engineering at Lancaster University in 1965. His initial work concerned discrete time domain models for chemical engineering applications.\n While at Lancaster, he founded and became managing director of ISCOL (International Systems Corporation of Lancaster). He remained in academia until 1974, when he left to start his own consulting company.\n He served on the Research Section Committee and Council of the Royal Statistical Society in the 1960s, founded the Journal of Systems Engineering in 1969, and briefly carried out public duties with the Royal Treasury in the mid-1970s. He was elected to the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and the Institute of Statisticians.\n He was a jazz and blues enthusiast and an accomplished pianist.\n He succumbed to Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1982.\n ", "tags": ["1933 births", "1982 deaths", "People from Swansea", "Alumni of University College London", "Welsh statisticians", "Deaths from lymphoma", "Systems engineers", "Academics of Lancaster University", "20th-century mathematicians", "Use dmy dates from May 2012", "Use British English from May 2012", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Welsh-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nGwilym JenkinsBorn(1932-08-12)12 August 1932Gowerton, Swansea, Wales, UKDied10 July 1982(1982-07-10) (aged\u00a049)NationalityWelshAlma\u00a0materUniversity College LondonKnown\u00a0forBox\u2013Jenkins approachScientific careerFieldsStatistics, time series analysisInstitutionsLancaster UniversityDoctoral advisorsFlorence Nightingale DavidNorman Lloyd Johnson\n\nGwilym Meirion Jenkins (12 August 1932 \u2013 10 July 1982) was a British statistician and systems engineer, born in Gowerton (Welsh: Treg\u0175yr), Swansea, Wales.[1] He is most notable for his pioneering work with George Box on autoregressive moving average models, also called Box\u2013Jenkins models, in time-series analysis.\nHe earned a first class honours degree in mathematics in 1953 followed by a Ph.D. at University College London in 1956.
