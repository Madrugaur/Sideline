{"name": "Martha J. B. Thomas", "content": "Martha J. B. Thomas, MBA (1926\u20132006) was an American chemical engineer and analytical chemist. She is particularly known for her work on phosphorus.\n Thomas was born in Boston in 1926. She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1945, after which she obtained a PhD in chemistry from Boston University in 1952, while working at Sylvania Electric Products.[1] Later in life, she received an MBA at Boston's Northeastern University in 1981.[2]\n Thomas was married to George Thomas, a government scientist, and they had four daughters.\n Thomas began her professional career in 1945 at Sylvania Electric Products, where she became the head of the Phosphor Research and Development Section  in 1970. During her time at Sylvania she established their first phosphor pilot plants. She also taught chemistry in Boston University's evening division between 1952 and 1970. She was a director of technical services at GTE Electrical Products Group in Danvers, Massachusetts, US.\n Thomas held over 20 patents for improving lighting technology and manufacturing, covering, for example, fluorescent lamps and phosphor chemistry.[3][4][5][6][7] One of her most important contributions was the development of a white phosphorus powder coating for fluorescent tubes creating a much more daylight-like light.[8] She also developed a phosphor-based treatment that increase the brightness of mercury lamps by 10%.[9]\n Thomas was awarded the Achievement Award of the Society of Women Engineers 1965.[10][11] The award was given \"in recognition of her significant contributions to the science of chemistry as an engineer, educator, and administrator, while fulfilling her duties as a wife and mother.\"[12]\n In 1991 she was named the New England Inventor by the Museum of Science in Boston, an award given to individuals \"whose application of science and technology, creativity, and independent thought has positively impacted society\".[2]\n She was the recipient of a Distinguished Alumni Award from Boston University.[13]\n ", "tags": ["1926 births", "2006 deaths", "People from Boston", "20th-century American chemists", "Chemical engineers", "Northeastern University alumni", "Boston University alumni", "Radcliffe College alumni", "CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "Martha J.
