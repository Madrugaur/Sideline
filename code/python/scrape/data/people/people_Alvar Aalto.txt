{"name": "Alvar Aalto", "content": "\n Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto (pronounced\u00a0[\u02c8hu\u0261o \u02c8\u0251l\u028b\u0251r \u02c8henrik \u02c8\u0251\u02d0lto]; 3 February 1898 \u2013 11 May 1976) was a Finnish architect and designer.[1] His work includes architecture, furniture, textiles and glassware, as well as sculptures and paintings. He never regarded himself as an artist, seeing painting and sculpture as \"branches of the tree whose trunk is architecture.\"[2] Aalto's early career ran in parallel with the rapid economic growth and industrialization of Finland during the first half of the 20th century. Many of his clients were industrialists, among them the Ahlstr\u00f6m-Gullichsen family.[3] The span of his career, from the 1920s to the 1970s, is reflected in the styles of his work, ranging from Nordic Classicism of the early work, to a rational International Style Modernism during the 1930s to a more organic modernist style from the 1940s onwards. Typical for his entire career is a concern for design as a Gesamtkunstwerk, a total work of art, in which he \u2013 together with his first wife Aino Aalto \u2013 would design the building, and give special treatment to the interior surfaces, furniture, lamps and glassware. His furniture designs are considered Scandinavian Modern, in the sense of a concern for materials, especially wood, and simplification but also technical experimentation, which led him to receiving patents for various manufacturing processes, such as bent wood.[4] As a designer he is celebrated as the inventor of bent plywood furniture.[5] The Alvar Aalto Museum, designed by Aalto himself, is located in what is regarded as his home city Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4.[6]\n Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born in Kuortane, Finland.[8] His father, Johan Henrik Aalto, was a Finnish-speaking land-surveyor and his mother, Selma Matilda \"Selly\" (n\u00e9e Hackstedt) was a Swedish-speaking postmistress. When Aalto was 5 years old, the family moved to Alaj\u00e4rvi, and from there to Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 in Central Finland.[9]\n He studied at the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Lyceum school, where he completed his basic education in 1916, and took drawing lessons from local artist Jonas Heiska. In 1916, he then enrolled to study architecture at the Helsinki University of Technology. His studies were interrupted by the Finnish Civil War, in which he fought. He fought on the side of the White Army and fought at the Battle of L\u00e4nkipohja and the Battle of Tampere.[10]\n He built his first piece of architecture while a student; a house for his parents at Alaj\u00e4rvi.[11] Later, he continued his education, graduating in 1921. In the summer of 1922 he began military service, finishing at Hamina reserve officer training school, and was promoted to reserve second lieutenant in June 1923.[12]\n In 1920, while a student, Aalto made his first trip abroad, travelling via Stockholm to Gothenburg, where he briefly found work with architect Arvid Bjerke.[13] In 1922, he accomplished his first independent piece at the Industrial Exposition in Tampere.[11] In 1923, he returned to Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, where he opened an architectural office under the name 'Alvar Aalto, Architect and Monumental Artist'. At that time he wrote articles for the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 newspaper Sis\u00e4-Suomi under the pseudonym Remus.[12] During this time, he designed a number of small single-family houses in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, and the office's workload steadily increased.[9]\n On 6 October 1924, Aalto married architect Aino Marsio. Their honeymoon in Italy was Aalto's first trip there, though Aino had previously made a study trip there.[14] The latter trip together sealed an intellectual bond with the culture of the Mediterranean region that remained important to Aalto for life.\n On their return they continued with several local projects, notably the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Worker's Club, which incorporated a number of motifs which they had studied during their trip, most notably the decorations of the Festival hall modelled on the Rucellai Sepulchre in Florence by Leon Battista Alberti. After winning the architecture competition for the Southwest Finland Agricultural Cooperative building in 1927, the Aaltos moved their office to Turku. They had made contact with the city's most progressive architect, Erik Bryggman before moving. They began collaborating with him, most notably on the Turku Fair of 1928\u201329. Aalto's biographer, G\u00f6ran Schildt, claimed that Bryggman was the only architect with whom Aalto cooperated as an equal.[15] With an increasing quantity of work in the Finnish capital, the Aaltos' office moved again in 1933 to Helsinki.[16]\n The Aaltos designed and built a joint house-office (1935\u201336) for themselves in Munkkiniemi, Helsinki, but later (1954\u201356) had a purpose-built office erected in the same neighbourhood \u2013 now the former is a \"home museum\" and the latter the premises of the Alvar Aalto Academy. In 1926, the young Aaltos designed and had built for themselves a summer cottage in Alaj\u00e4rvi, Villa Flora.[9]\n Aino Aalto died of cancer in 1949. Aino and Alvar Aalto had two children, a daughter, Johanna \"Hanni\", Mrs Alanen (born 1925), and a son, Hamilkar Aalto (born 1928). In 1952, Aalto married architect Elissa M\u00e4kiniemi (died 1994), who had been working as an assistant in his office.\n In 1952, he designed and built a summer cottage, the so-called Experimental House, for himself and his new wife in Muuratsalo in Central Finland.[17] Alvar Aalto died on 11 May 1976, in Helsinki, and is buried in the Hietaniemi cemetery in Helsinki. His wife and the office employees continued the works of the office which were still in progress. In 1978 the Museum of Finnish Architecture in Helsinki arranged a major exhibition of Aalto's works.\n Although he is sometimes regarded as among the first and most influential architects of Nordic modernism, closer examination reveals that Aalto (while a pioneer in Finland) closely followed and had personal contacts with other pioneers in Sweden, in particular Gunnar Asplund[18][19] and Sven Markelius.[20] What they, and many others of that generation in the Nordic countries shared, was a common classical education and an approach to classical architecture, that historians now call Nordic Classicism[21] It was a style that had been a reaction to the previous dominant style of National Romanticism before moving, in the late 1920s, towards Modernism.[citation needed]\n Upon returning to Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 in 1923 to establish his own architect's office, Aalto designed several single-family homes designed in the style of Nordic Classicism. For example, the manor-like house for his mother's cousin Terho Manner in T\u00f6ysa (1923), a summer villa for the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 chief constable (also from 1923) and the Alatalo farmhouse in Tarvaala (1924). During this period he completed his first public buildings, the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Workers' Club in 1925, the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Defence Corps building in 1926 and the Sein\u00e4joki Civil Guard House building in 1924\u201329.[citation needed] He entered several architectural competitions for prestigious state public buildings, in Finland and abroad. This included two competitions for the Finnish Parliament building in 1923 and 1924, the extension to the University of Helsinki in 1931, and the building to house the League of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1926\u201327.[citation needed]\n Aalto's first church design to be completed, Muurame church, illustrates his transition from Nordic Classicism to Functionalism.[22]\n This was the period when Aalto was most prolific in his writings, with articles for professional journals and newspapers. Among his most well-known essays from this period are \"Urban culture\" (1924),[23] \"Temple baths on Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 ridge\" (1925),[24] \"Abb\u00e9 Coignard's sermon\" (1925),[25] and \"From doorstep to living room\" (1926).[26]\n The shift in Aalto's design approach from classicism to modernism is epitomised by the Viipuri Library in Vyborg (1927\u201335), which went through a transformation from an originally classical competition entry proposal to the completed high-modernist building. His humanistic approach is in full evidence in the library: the interior displays natural materials, warm colours, and undulating lines. Due to problems about financing and a change of site, the Viipuri Library project lasted eight years. During that time he designed the Standard Apartment Building (1928\u201329) in Turku, Turun Sanomat Building (1929\u201330) and Paimio Sanatorium (1929\u201332). A number of factors heralded Aalto's shift towards modernism: on a personal level, Aalto's increased familiarization of international trends, especially after travelling throughout Europe, but in terms of completed projects it was the client of the Standard Apartment Building giving Aalto the opportunity to experiment with concrete prefabrication, the cutting-edge Corbusian form language of the Turun Sanomat Building, and these were then carried forward both in the Paimio Sanatorium and in the ongoing design for the library. Although the Turun Sanomat Building and Paimio Sanatorium are comparatively pure modernist works, they carried the seeds of his questioning of such an orthodox modernist approach and a move to a more daring, synthetic attitude. It has been pointed out that the planning principle for Paimio Sanatorium \u2013 the splayed wings \u2013 was indebted to the Zonnestraal Sanatorium (1925\u201331) by Jan Duiker, which Aalto visited while under construction.[28] While these early Functionalist works by Aalto bear hallmarks of influences from Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius and other key modernist figures of central Europe, in all these buildings Aalto nevertheless started to show his individuality in a departure from such norms with the introduction of organic references.\n Through Sven Markelius, Aalto became a member of the Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM), attending the second congress in Frankfurt in 1929 and the fourth congress in Athens in 1933, where he established a close friendship with L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, Sigfried Giedion and Philip Morton Shand. It was during this time that he followed closely the work of the main driving force behind the new modernism, Le Corbusier, and visited him in his Paris office several times in the following years.\n It was not until the completion of the Paimio Sanatorium (1932) and Viipuri Library (1935) that Aalto first achieved world attention in architecture. His reputation grew in the US following the invitation to hold a retrospective exhibition of his works at the MOMA in New York in 1938, which was his visit to the US. The significance of the exhibition \u2013 which later went on a 12-city tour of the country \u2013 is in the fact that he was the second-ever architect \u2013 after Le Corbusier \u2013 to have a solo exhibition at the museum. His reputation grew in the US following the critical reception of his design for the Finnish Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair, described by Frank Lloyd Wright as a \"work of genius\".[29] It could be said that Aalto's international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedion's influential book on Modernist architecture, Space, Time and Architecture: The growth of a new tradition (1949), in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect, including Le Corbusier. In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life and even national characteristics, declaring that \"Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes\".\n During the 1930s Alvar spent some time experimenting with laminated wood, sculpture and abstract relief, characterized by irregular curved forms. Utilizing this knowledge he was able to solve technical problems concerning the flexibility of wood and also of working out spatial issues in his designs.[10] Aalto's early experiments with wood and his move away from a purist modernism would be tested in built form with the commission to design Villa Mairea (1939) in Noormarkku, the luxury home of young industrialist couple Harry and Maire Gullichsen. It was Maire Gullichsen who acted as the main client, and she worked closely not only with Alvar but also Aino Aalto on the design, inspiring them to be more daring in their work. The original design was to include a private art gallery: this was not built. The building forms a U-shape around a central inner 'garden', where the central feature is a kidney-shaped swimming pool. Adjacent to the pool is a sauna executed in a rustic style, alluding to both Finnish and Japanese precedents. The design of the house is a synthesis of numerous stylistic influences, from traditional Finnish vernacular to purist modernism, as well as influences from English and Japanese architecture. While the house is clearly intended for a wealthy family, Aalto nevertheless argued that it was also an experiment that would prove useful in the design of mass housing.[30]\n His increased fame led to offers and commissions outside Finland. In 1941 he accepted an invitation as a visiting professor to Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US. Because of the Second World War, he returned to Finland to direct the Reconstruction Office. Post war, he returned to MIT, where he designed the student dormitory Baker House, completed in 1949.[31] The dormitory lay along the Charles River and its undulating form provided maximum view and ventilation for each resident.[32] This building was the first building of Aalto's redbrick period. Originally used in Baker House to signify the Ivy League university tradition, on his return to Finland Aalto used it in a number of key buildings, in particular, in several of the buildings in the new Helsinki University of Technology campus (starting in 1950), S\u00e4yn\u00e4tsalo Town Hall (1952), Helsinki Pensions Institute (1954), Helsinki House of Culture (1958), as well as in his own summer house, the Experimental House in Muuratsalo (1957).\n In the 1950s Aalto immersed himself in sculpting: wood, bronze, marble or mixed media. Among notable works from this period is the memorial to the Battle of Suomussalmi (1960).  Located on the battlefield, it consists of a leaning bronze pillar on a pedestal.[10]\n The early 1960s and 1970s (until his death in 1976) were marked by key works in Helsinki, in particular the huge town plan for the void in centre of Helsinki adjacent to T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 Bay and the vast railway yards, and marked on the edges by significant buildings such as the National Museum and the main railway station, both by Eliel Saarinen. In his town plan Aalto proposed a line of separate marble-clad buildings fronting the bay which would house various cultural institutions, including a concert hall, opera, museum of architecture and headquarters for the Finnish Academy. The scheme also extended into the Kamppi district with a series of tall office blocks. Aalto first presented his scheme in 1961, but it went through various modifications during the early 1960s. Only two fragments of the overall plan were realized: the Finlandia Hall concert hall (1976) fronting T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 Bay, and an office building in the Kamppi district for the Helsinki Electricity Company (1975). The Miesian formal language of geometric grids employed in the buildings was also used by Aalto for other sites in Helsinki, including the Enso-Gutzeit headquarters building (1962), the Academic Bookstore (1962) and the SYP Bank building (1969).\n Following Aalto's death in 1976 his office continued to operate under the direction of his widow Elissa, completing works already (to some extent) designed. These works include the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 City Theatre and Essen opera house. Since the death of Elissa Aalto the office has continued to operate as the Alvar Aalto Academy, giving advice on the restoration of Aalto buildings and organising vast archive material.\n Whereas Aalto was famous for his architecture, his furniture designs were well thought of and are still popular today. He studied Josef Hoffmann and the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, and for a period of time, worked under Eliel Saarinen.[4] He also gained inspiration from Gebr\u00fcder Thonet.[4] During the late 1920s and 1930s he, working closely with Aino Aalto, also focusing much of his energy on furniture design, partly due to the decision to design much of the individual furniture pieces and lamps for the Paimio Sanatorium. Of particular significance was the experimentation in bent plywood chairs, most notably the so-called Paimio chair, which had been designed for the sitting tuberculosis patient, and the Model 60 stacking stool. The Aaltos, together with visual arts promoter Maire Gullichsen and art historian Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the Artek company in 1935, ostensibly to sell Aalto products but also other imported products.[33] He became the first furniture designer to use the cantilever principle in chair design using wood.[4]\n Aalto's awards included the Prince Eugen Medal in 1954, the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1957 and the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects in 1963. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957.[34] He also was a member of the Academy of Finland, and was its president from 1963 to 1968. From 1925 to 1956 he was a member of the Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne. In 1960 he received an honorary doctorate at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).[35]\n Aalto's career spans the changes in style from (Nordic Classicism) to purist International Style Modernism to a more personal, synthetic and idiosyncratic Modernism. Aalto's wide field of design activity ranges from the large scale of city planning and architecture to interior design, furniture and glassware design and painting. It has been estimated that during his entire career Aalto designed over 500 individual buildings, approximately 300 of which were built, the vast majority of which are in Finland. He also has a few buildings in France, Germany, Italy and the USA.[36]\n Aalto's work with wood, was influenced by early Scandinavian architects. His experiments and departure from the norm brought attention to his ability to make wood do things not previously done. His techniques in the way he cut the beech tree, for example, and also his ability to use plywood as structural and aesthetic. Other examples include the rough-hewn vertical placement of logs at his pavilion at the Lapua expo, looking similar to a medieval barricade, at the orchestra platform at Turku and the Paris expo at the World Fair, he used varying sizes and shapes of planks. Also at Paris and at Villa Mairea he utilized birch boarding in a vertical arrangement. Also his famous undulating walls and ceilings made of red pine.[37] In his roofing, he created massive spans (155-foot at the covered statium at Otaniemi) all without tie rods. His stairway at Villa Mairea, he evokes feelings of a natural forest by binding beech wood with withes into columns.[38]\n Aalto claimed that his paintings were not made as individual artworks but as part of his process of architectural design, and many of his small-scale \"sculptural\" experiments with wood led to later larger architectural details and forms. These experiments also led to a number of patents: for example, he invented a new form of laminated bent-plywood furniture in 1932 (which was patented in 1933).[1] His experimental method had been influenced by his meetings with various members of the Bauhaus design school, especially L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, whom he first met in 1930. Aalto's furniture was exhibited in London in 1935, to great critical acclaim, and to cope with the consumer demand Aalto, together with his wife Aino, Maire Gullichsen and Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the company Artek that same year. Aalto glassware (Aino as well as Alvar) is manufactured by Iittala.\n Aalto's 'High Stool' and 'Stool E60' (manufactured by Artek) are currently used in Apple Stores across the world to serve as seating for customers. Finished in black lacquer, the stools are used to seat customers at the 'Genius Bar' and also in other areas of the store at times when seating is required for a product workshop or special event. Aalto was also influential in bringing modern art to the knowledge of the Finnish people, in particular the work of his friends, Alexander Milne Calder and Fernand L\u00e9ger.[10]\n Aalto has an early place in any alphabetical list, and in May 2020 his entry in the combined index of Who Was Who was second out of 131,546 entries. First was Robert Aagaard, a furniture maker.[56]\n As already mentioned, Aalto's international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedion's influential book on Modernist architecture, Space, Time and Architecture: The growth of a new tradition (1949), in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect, including Le Corbusier. In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life and even national characteristics, declaring that \"Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes\". However, a few more recent architecture critics and historians have questioned Aalto's position of influence in the canonic history. Italian Marxist architecture historians Manfredo Tafuri and Francesco Dal Co put forward the viewpoint that Aalto's \"historical significance has perhaps been rather exaggerated; with Aalto we are outside of the great themes that have made the course of contemporary architecture so dramatic. The qualities of his works have a meaning only as masterful distractions, not subject to reproduction outside the remote reality in which they have their roots.\"[57] Their viewpoint was propounded by their own priority given to urbanism, seeing Aalto as an anti-urban, and thus consequently disparaging what they regarded as peripheral non-urban areas of the world: \"Essentially his architecture is not appropriate to urban typologies.\" Similarly concerned with the appropriateness of Aalto's form language, at the other end of the political spectrum, American postmodernist critic Charles Jencks made a claim for the need for buildings to signify meaning; however, he then lifted out Aalto's Pensions Institute building as an example of what he termed Aalto's 'soft paternalism': \"Conceived as a fragmented mass to break up the feeling of bureaucracy, it succeeds all too well in being humane and killing the pensioner with kindness. The forms are familiar red brick and ribbon-strip windows broken by copper and bronze elements \u2013 all carried through with a literal-mindedness that borders on the soporific.\"[58] But also during Aalto's lifetime he faced critique from his fellow architects in Finland, most notably Kirmo Mikkola and Juhani Pallasmaa; by the last decade of his life Aalto's work was seen as idiosyncratic and individualistic, when the opposing tendencies of rationalism and constructivism \u2013 often championed under left-wing politics \u2013 argued for anonymous virtually non-aesthetic architecture. Mikkola wrote of Aalto's late works: \"Aalto has moved to his present baroque line...\"[59]\n Aalto has been commemorated in a number of ways:\n G\u00f6ran Schildt has written and edited many books on Aalto, the most well-known being the three-volume biography, usually referred to as the definitive biography on Aalto.\n  Media related to Alvar Aalto at Wikimedia Commons\n Quotations related to Alvar Aalto at Wikiquote\n ", "tags": ["Alvar Aalto", "1898 births", "1976 deaths", "People from Kuortane", "People from Vaasa Province (Grand Duchy of Finland)", "People of the Finnish Civil War (White side)", "20th-century Finnish architects", "Finnish furniture designers", "Finnish industrial designers", "Modernist architects", "International style architects", "Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne members", "Modernist architecture in Finland", "Recipients of the Royal Gold Medal", "Aalto University alumni", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin", "Recipients of the Prince Eugen Medal", "Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)", "Burials at Hietaniemi Cemetery", "1939 New York World's Fair artists", "CS1 Finnish-language sources (fi)", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from March 2021", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2018", "Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from September 2017", "CS1 Norwegian-language sources (no)", "CS1: long volume value", "CS1 Italian-language sources (it)", "Commons link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with AGSA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NGV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RSL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "AC with 29 elements"], "raw": "Finnish architect and designer (1898\u20131976)\n\n\nAlvar AaltoAalto in 1960BornHugo Alvar Henrik Aalto(1898-02-03)3 February 1898Kuortane, Grand Duchy of Finland, Russian EmpireDied11 May 1976(1976-05-11) (aged\u00a078)Helsinki, FinlandNationalityFinnishAlma\u00a0materHelsinki University of TechnologyOccupationArchitectSpouse(s)Aino Marsio (m. 1925\u201349; her death)  Elissa M\u00e4kiniemi (m. 1952\u201376; his death)Children2AwardsPrince Eugen Medal (1954)RIBA Gold Medal (1957)AIA Gold Medal (1963)BuildingsPaimio SanatoriumS\u00e4yn\u00e4tsalo Town HallViipuri LibraryVilla MaireaBaker HouseFinlandia HallProjectsHelsinki City CentreDesignSavoy VasePaimio Chair\n\nHugo Alvar Henrik Aalto (pronounced\u00a0[\u02c8hu\u0261o \u02c8\u0251l\u028b\u0251r \u02c8henrik \u02c8\u0251\u02d0lto]; 3 February 1898 \u2013 11 May 1976) was a Finnish architect and designer.[1] His work includes architecture, furniture, textiles and glassware, as well as sculptures and paintings.

When Aalto was 5 years old, the family moved to Alaj\u00e4rvi, and from there to Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 in Central Finland.[9]\nHe studied at the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Lyceum school, where he completed his basic education in 1916, and took drawing lessons from local artist Jonas Heiska. In 1916, he then enrolled to study architecture at the Helsinki University of Technology. His studies were interrupted by the Finnish Civil War, in which he fought. He fought on the side of the White Army and fought at the Battle of L\u00e4nkipohja and the Battle of Tampere.[10]\nHe built his first piece of architecture while a student; a house for his parents at Alaj\u00e4rvi.[11] Later, he continued his education, graduating in 1921. In the summer of 1922 he began military service, finishing at Hamina reserve officer training school, and was promoted to reserve second lieutenant in June 1923.[12]\nIn 1920, while a student, Aalto made his first trip abroad, travelling via Stockholm to Gothenburg, where he briefly found work with architect Arvid Bjerke.[13] In 1922, he accomplished his first independent piece at the Industrial Exposition in Tampere.[11] In 1923, he returned to Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, where he opened an architectural office under the name 'Alvar Aalto, Architect and Monumental Artist'. At that time he wrote articles for the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 newspaper Sis\u00e4-Suomi under the pseudonym Remus.[12] During this time, he designed a number of small single-family houses in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, and the office's workload steadily increased.[9]\nOn 6 October 1924, Aalto married architect Aino Marsio. Their honeymoon in Italy was Aalto's first trip there, though Aino had previously made a study trip there.[14] The latter trip together sealed an intellectual bond with the culture of the Mediterranean region that remained important to Aalto for life.\nOn their return they continued with several local projects, notably the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Worker's Club, which incorporated a number of motifs which they had studied during their trip, most notably the decorations of the Festival hall modelled on the Rucellai Sepulchre in Florence by Leon Battista Alberti. After winning the architecture competition for the Southwest Finland Agricultural Cooperative building in 1927, the Aaltos moved their office to Turku. They had made contact with the city's most progressive architect, Erik Bryggman before moving. They began collaborating with him, most notably on the Turku Fair of 1928\u201329. Aalto's biographer, G\u00f6ran Schildt, claimed that Bryggman was the only architect with whom Aalto cooperated as an equal.[15] With an increasing quantity of work in the Finnish capital, the Aaltos' office moved again in 1933 to Helsinki.[16]\nThe Aaltos designed and built a joint house-office (1935\u201336) for themselves in Munkkiniemi, Helsinki, but later (1954\u201356) had a purpose-built office erected in the same neighbourhood \u2013 now the former is a \"home museum\" and the latter the premises of the Alvar Aalto Academy. In 1926, the young Aaltos designed and had built for themselves a summer cottage in Alaj\u00e4rvi, Villa Flora.[9]\n\nDeath[edit]\nAino Aalto died of cancer in 1949. Aino and Alvar Aalto had two children, a daughter, Johanna \"Hanni\", Mrs Alanen (born 1925), and a son, Hamilkar Aalto (born 1928). In 1952, Aalto married architect Elissa M\u00e4kiniemi (died 1994), who had been working as an assistant in his office.\nIn 1952, he designed and built a summer cottage, the so-called Experimental House, for himself and his new wife in Muuratsalo in Central Finland.[17] Alvar Aalto died on 11 May 1976, in Helsinki, and is buried in the Hietaniemi cemetery in Helsinki. His wife and the office employees continued the works of the office which were still in progress. In 1978 the Museum of Finnish Architecture in Helsinki arranged a major exhibition of Aalto's works.\n\nArchitecture career[edit]\nEarly career: classicism[edit]\nAlthough he is sometimes regarded as among the first and most influential architects of Nordic modernism, closer examination reveals that Aalto (while a pioneer in Finland) closely followed and had personal contacts with other pioneers in Sweden, in particular Gunnar Asplund[18][19] and Sven Markelius.[20] What they, and many others of that generation in the Nordic countries shared, was a common classical education and an approach to classical architecture, that historians now call Nordic Classicism[21] It was a style that had been a reaction to the previous dominant style of National Romanticism before moving, in the late 1920s, towards Modernism.[citation needed]\nUpon returning to Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 in 1923 to establish his own architect's office, Aalto designed several single-family homes designed in the style of Nordic Classicism. For example, the manor-like house for his mother's cousin Terho Manner in T\u00f6ysa (1923), a summer villa for the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 chief constable (also from 1923) and the Alatalo farmhouse in Tarvaala (1924). During this period he completed his first public buildings, the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Workers' Club in 1925, the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Defence Corps building in 1926 and the Sein\u00e4joki Civil Guard House building in 1924\u201329.[citation needed] He entered several architectural competitions for prestigious state public buildings, in Finland and abroad. This included two competitions for the Finnish Parliament building in 1923 and 1924, the extension to the University of Helsinki in 1931, and the building to house the League of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1926\u201327.[citation needed]\nAalto's first church design to be completed, Muurame church, illustrates his transition from Nordic Classicism to Functionalism.[22]\nThis was the period when Aalto was most prolific in his writings, with articles for professional journals and newspapers. Among his most well-known essays from this period are \"Urban culture\" (1924),[23] \"Temple baths on Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 ridge\" (1925),[24] \"Abb\u00e9 Coignard's sermon\" (1925),[25] and \"From doorstep to living room\" (1926).[26]\n\n Villa Mairea in Noormarkku\n Facade of Baker House on the Charles River\n The main auditorium of the Helsinki University of Technology (now Aalto University) in Otaniemi, Finland (1949\u201366)\n House of Culture, Helsinki\n Cultural Center Wolfsburg (1958\u201362)[27]\n Finlandia Hall (1962\u201371)\n The Aalto-Theater opera house in Essen, Germany\nEarly career: functionalism[edit]\nThe shift in Aalto's design approach from classicism to modernism is epitomised by the Viipuri Library in Vyborg (1927\u201335), which went through a transformation from an originally classical competition entry proposal to the completed high-modernist building. His humanistic approach is in full evidence in the library: the interior displays natural materials, warm colours, and undulating lines. Due to problems about financing and a change of site, the Viipuri Library project lasted eight years. During that time he designed the Standard Apartment Building (1928\u201329) in Turku, Turun Sanomat Building (1929\u201330) and Paimio Sanatorium (1929\u201332). A number of factors heralded Aalto's shift towards modernism: on a personal level, Aalto's increased familiarization of international trends, especially after travelling throughout Europe, but in terms of completed projects it was the client of the Standard Apartment Building giving Aalto the opportunity to experiment with concrete prefabrication, the cutting-edge Corbusian form language of the Turun Sanomat Building, and these were then carried forward both in the Paimio Sanatorium and in the ongoing design for the library. Although the Turun Sanomat Building and Paimio Sanatorium are comparatively pure modernist works, they carried the seeds of his questioning of such an orthodox modernist approach and a move to a more daring, synthetic attitude. It has been pointed out that the planning principle for Paimio Sanatorium \u2013 the splayed wings \u2013 was indebted to the Zonnestraal Sanatorium (1925\u201331) by Jan Duiker, which Aalto visited while under construction.[28] While these early Functionalist works by Aalto bear hallmarks of influences from Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius and other key modernist figures of central Europe, in all these buildings Aalto nevertheless started to show his individuality in a departure from such norms with the introduction of organic references.\nThrough Sven Markelius, Aalto became a member of the Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM), attending the second congress in Frankfurt in 1929 and the fourth congress in Athens in 1933, where he established a close friendship with L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, Sigfried Giedion and Philip Morton Shand. It was during this time that he followed closely the work of the main driving force behind the new modernism, Le Corbusier, and visited him in his Paris office several times in the following years.\nIt was not until the completion of the Paimio Sanatorium (1932) and Viipuri Library (1935) that Aalto first achieved world attention in architecture. His reputation grew in the US following the invitation to hold a retrospective exhibition of his works at the MOMA in New York in 1938, which was his visit to the US. The significance of the exhibition \u2013 which later went on a 12-city tour of the country \u2013 is in the fact that he was the second-ever architect \u2013 after Le Corbusier \u2013 to have a solo exhibition at the museum. His reputation grew in the US following the critical reception of his design for the Finnish Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair, described by Frank Lloyd Wright as a \"work of genius\".[29] It could be said that Aalto's international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedion's influential book on Modernist architecture, Space, Time and Architecture: The growth of a new tradition (1949), in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect, including Le Corbusier. In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life and even national characteristics, declaring that \"Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes\".\n\nMid career: experimentation[edit]\nDuring the 1930s Alvar spent some time experimenting with laminated wood, sculpture and abstract relief, characterized by irregular curved forms. Utilizing this knowledge he was able to solve technical problems concerning the flexibility of wood and also of working out spatial issues in his designs.[10] Aalto's early experiments with wood and his move away from a purist modernism would be tested in built form with the commission to design Villa Mairea (1939) in Noormarkku, the luxury home of young industrialist couple Harry and Maire Gullichsen. It was Maire Gullichsen who acted as the main client, and she worked closely not only with Alvar but also Aino Aalto on the design, inspiring them to be more daring in their work. The original design was to include a private art gallery: this was not built. The building forms a U-shape around a central inner 'garden', where the central feature is a kidney-shaped swimming pool. Adjacent to the pool is a sauna executed in a rustic style, alluding to both Finnish and Japanese precedents. The design of the house is a synthesis of numerous stylistic influences, from traditional Finnish vernacular to purist modernism, as well as influences from English and Japanese architecture. While the house is clearly intended for a wealthy family, Aalto nevertheless argued that it was also an experiment that would prove useful in the design of mass housing.[30]\nHis increased fame led to offers and commissions outside Finland. In 1941 he accepted an invitation as a visiting professor to Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US. Because of the Second World War, he returned to Finland to direct the Reconstruction Office. Post war, he returned to MIT, where he designed the student dormitory Baker House, completed in 1949.[31] The dormitory lay along the Charles River and its undulating form provided maximum view and ventilation for each resident.[32] This building was the first building of Aalto's redbrick period. Originally used in Baker House to signify the Ivy League university tradition, on his return to Finland Aalto used it in a number of key buildings, in particular, in several of the buildings in the new Helsinki University of Technology campus (starting in 1950), S\u00e4yn\u00e4tsalo Town Hall (1952), Helsinki Pensions Institute (1954), Helsinki House of Culture (1958), as well as in his own summer house, the Experimental House in Muuratsalo (1957).\nIn the 1950s Aalto immersed himself in sculpting: wood, bronze, marble or mixed media. Among notable works from this period is the memorial to the Battle of Suomussalmi (1960).  Located on the battlefield, it consists of a leaning bronze pillar on a pedestal.[10]\n\nMature career: monumentalism[edit]\nThe early 1960s and 1970s (until his death in 1976) were marked by key works in Helsinki, in particular the huge town plan for the void in centre of Helsinki adjacent to T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 Bay and the vast railway yards, and marked on the edges by significant buildings such as the National Museum and the main railway station, both by Eliel Saarinen. In his town plan Aalto proposed a line of separate marble-clad buildings fronting the bay which would house various cultural institutions, including a concert hall, opera, museum of architecture and headquarters for the Finnish Academy. The scheme also extended into the Kamppi district with a series of tall office blocks. Aalto first presented his scheme in 1961, but it went through various modifications during the early 1960s. Only two fragments of the overall plan were realized: the Finlandia Hall concert hall (1976) fronting T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 Bay, and an office building in the Kamppi district for the Helsinki Electricity Company (1975). The Miesian formal language of geometric grids employed in the buildings was also used by Aalto for other sites in Helsinki, including the Enso-Gutzeit headquarters building (1962), the Academic Bookstore (1962) and the SYP Bank building (1969).\nFollowing Aalto's death in 1976 his office continued to operate under the direction of his widow Elissa, completing works already (to some extent) designed. These works include the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 City Theatre and Essen opera house. Since the death of Elissa Aalto the office has continued to operate as the Alvar Aalto Academy, giving advice on the restoration of Aalto buildings and organising vast archive material.\n\nFurniture career[edit]\n Paimio chair\n Model 60 stacking stools\nWhereas Aalto was famous for his architecture, his furniture designs were well thought of and are still popular today. He studied Josef Hoffmann and the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, and for a period of time, worked under Eliel Saarinen.[4] He also gained inspiration from Gebr\u00fcder Thonet.[4] During the late 1920s and 1930s he, working closely with Aino Aalto, also focusing much of his energy on furniture design, partly due to the decision to design much of the individual furniture pieces and lamps for the Paimio Sanatorium. Of particular significance was the experimentation in bent plywood chairs, most notably the so-called Paimio chair, which had been designed for the sitting tuberculosis patient, and the Model 60 stacking stool. The Aaltos, together with visual arts promoter Maire Gullichsen and art historian Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the Artek company in 1935, ostensibly to sell Aalto products but also other imported products.[33] He became the first furniture designer to use the cantilever principle in chair design using wood.[4]\n\nAwards[edit]\nAalto's awards included the Prince Eugen Medal in 1954, the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1957 and the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects in 1963. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957.[34] He also was a member of the Academy of Finland, and was its president from 1963 to 1968. From 1925 to 1956 he was a member of the Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne. In 1960 he received an honorary doctorate at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).[35]\n\nWorks[edit]\nAalto's career spans the changes in style from (Nordic Classicism) to purist International Style Modernism to a more personal, synthetic and idiosyncratic Modernism. Aalto's wide field of design activity ranges from the large scale of city planning and architecture to interior design, furniture and glassware design and painting. It has been estimated that during his entire career Aalto designed over 500 individual buildings, approximately 300 of which were built, the vast majority of which are in Finland. He also has a few buildings in France, Germany, Italy and the USA.[36]\nAalto's work with wood, was influenced by early Scandinavian architects. His experiments and departure from the norm brought attention to his ability to make wood do things not previously done. His techniques in the way he cut the beech tree, for example, and also his ability to use plywood as structural and aesthetic. Other examples include the rough-hewn vertical placement of logs at his pavilion at the Lapua expo, looking similar to a medieval barricade, at the orchestra platform at Turku and the Paris expo at the World Fair, he used varying sizes and shapes of planks. Also at Paris and at Villa Mairea he utilized birch boarding in a vertical arrangement. Also his famous undulating walls and ceilings made of red pine.[37] In his roofing, he created massive spans (155-foot at the covered statium at Otaniemi) all without tie rods. His stairway at Villa Mairea, he evokes feelings of a natural forest by binding beech wood with withes into columns.[38]\nAalto claimed that his paintings were not made as individual artworks but as part of his process of architectural design, and many of his small-scale \"sculptural\" experiments with wood led to later larger architectural details and forms. These experiments also led to a number of patents: for example, he invented a new form of laminated bent-plywood furniture in 1932 (which was patented in 1933).[1] His experimental method had been influenced by his meetings with various members of the Bauhaus design school, especially L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, whom he first met in 1930. Aalto's furniture was exhibited in London in 1935, to great critical acclaim, and to cope with the consumer demand Aalto, together with his wife Aino, Maire Gullichsen and Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the company Artek that same year. Aalto glassware (Aino as well as Alvar) is manufactured by Iittala.\nAalto's 'High Stool' and 'Stool E60' (manufactured by Artek) are currently used in Apple Stores across the world to serve as seating for customers. Finished in black lacquer, the stools are used to seat customers at the 'Genius Bar' and also in other areas of the store at times when seating is required for a product workshop or special event. Aalto was also influential in bringing modern art to the knowledge of the Finnish people, in particular the work of his friends, Alexander Milne Calder and Fernand L\u00e9ger.[10]\n\nSignificant buildings[edit]\n KUNSTEN Museum of Modern Art Aalborg, Denmark (1958\u201372)\n Church of Santa Maria Assunta, Riola of Vergato, Italy, designed in 1966 and built 1975\u20131978.

First was Robert Aagaard, a furniture maker.[56]\n\nCritique of Aalto's architecture[edit]\nAs already mentioned, Aalto's international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedion's influential book on Modernist architecture, Space, Time and Architecture: The growth of a new tradition (1949), in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect, including Le Corbusier. In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life and even national characteristics, declaring that \"Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes\". However, a few more recent architecture critics and historians have questioned Aalto's position of influence in the canonic history. Italian Marxist architecture historians Manfredo Tafuri and Francesco Dal Co put forward the viewpoint that Aalto's \"historical significance has perhaps been rather exaggerated; with Aalto we are outside of the great themes that have made the course of contemporary architecture so dramatic. The qualities of his works have a meaning only as masterful distractions, not subject to reproduction outside the remote reality in which they have their roots.\"[57] Their viewpoint was propounded by their own priority given to urbanism, seeing Aalto as an anti-urban, and thus consequently disparaging what they regarded as peripheral non-urban areas of the world: \"Essentially his architecture is not appropriate to urban typologies.\" Similarly concerned with the appropriateness of Aalto's form language, at the other end of the political spectrum, American postmodernist critic Charles Jencks made a claim for the need for buildings to signify meaning; however, he then lifted out Aalto's Pensions Institute building as an example of what he termed Aalto's 'soft paternalism': \"Conceived as a fragmented mass to break up the feeling of bureaucracy, it succeeds all too well in being humane and killing the pensioner with kindness. The forms are familiar red brick and ribbon-strip windows broken by copper and bronze elements \u2013 all carried through with a literal-mindedness that borders on the soporific.\"[58] But also during Aalto's lifetime he faced critique from his fellow architects in Finland, most notably Kirmo Mikkola and Juhani Pallasmaa; by the last decade of his life Aalto's work was seen as idiosyncratic and individualistic, when the opposing tendencies of rationalism and constructivism \u2013 often championed under left-wing politics \u2013 argued for anonymous virtually non-aesthetic architecture. Mikkola wrote of Aalto's late works: \"Aalto has moved to his present baroque line...\"[59]\n\n Alvar Aalto portrayed on a stamp published in 1976\nMemorials[edit]\nAalto has been commemorated in a number of ways:\n\nAlvar Aalto is the eponym of the Alvar Aalto Medal, now considered[by whom?] one of world architecture's most prestigious awards.\nAalto was featured in the 50 mk note in the last series of the Finnish markka (before its replacement by the Euro in 2002).\nThe centenary of Aalto's birth in 1998 was marked in Finland not only by several books and exhibitions, but also by the promotion of specially bottled red and white Aalto Wine and a specially designed cupcake.\nIn 1976, the year of his death, Aalto was commemorated on a Finnish postage stamp.\nPiazza Alvar Aalto, a square named after Aalto, can be found in the Porta Nuova business district of Milan, Italy\nAalto University, a Finnish university formed by merging Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki School of Economics and TaiK in 2010, is named after Alvar Aalto.\nAn Alvar Aallon katu (Alvar Aalto Street) can be found in five different Finnish cities: Helsinki, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Oulu, Kotka and Sein\u00e4joki.\nIn 2017, the Alvar Aalto Museum launched Alvar Aalto Cities, that is, a network of cities containing buildings by Alvar Aalto.[60] The objective of the network is to increase awareness of Aalto's work both in Finland and abroad. It is hoped that by combining forces on communications and marketing, the visibility and accessibility of exhibitions, tourist attractions and events will be improved. To date, the network city members are: Aalborg, Alaj\u00e4rvi, Espoo, Eura, Hamina, Helsinki, Imatra, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4, Kotka, Kouvola, Lahti, Oulu, Paimio, Pori, Raseborg, Rovaniemi, Sein\u00e4joki, Turku, Vantaa and Varkaus. It is estimated that in total there would be 40 cities worldwide that would qualify as Alvar Aalto City.\nSee also[edit]\nArchitecture of Finland\nAino Aalto\nElissa Aalto\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b Chilvers 2004, p.\u00a01\n\n^ Enckell 1998, p.\u00a032\n\n^ Anon 2013\n\n^ a b c d Boyce 1985, p.\u00a01\n\n^ Norwich, John Julius (1990).
