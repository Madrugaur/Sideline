{"name": "Stefan Mazurkiewicz", "content": "Stefan Mazurkiewicz (25 September 1888 \u2013 19 June 1945) was a Polish mathematician who worked in mathematical analysis, topology, and probability.  He was a student of Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski and a member of the Polish Academy of Learning (PAU). His students included Karol Borsuk, Bronis\u0142aw Knaster, Kazimierz Kuratowski, Stanis\u0142aw Saks, and Antoni Zygmund.  For a time Mazurkiewicz was a professor at the University of Paris; however, he spent most of his career as a professor at the University of Warsaw.  \n The Hahn\u2013Mazurkiewicz theorem, a basic result on curves prompted by the phenomenon of space-filling curves, is named for Mazurkiewicz and Hans Hahn. His 1935 paper Sur l'existence des continus ind\u00e9composables is generally considered the most elegant piece of work in point-set topology.\n During the Polish\u2013Soviet War (1919\u201321), Mazurkiewicz as early as 1919 broke the most common Russian cipher for the Polish General Staff's cryptological agency.  Thanks to this, orders issued by Soviet commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky's staff were known to Polish Army leaders.  This contributed substantially, perhaps decisively, to Polish victory at the critical Battle of Warsaw and possibly to Poland's survival as an independent country. \n This article about a Polish mathematician is a stub.
