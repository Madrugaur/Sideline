In 1980 he accepted an offer of a full professorship from the Bundeswehr University of Munich. In 1982 he returned to TU Munich to fill a chair in computer science. In 2000 Zenger was selected as a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities.[1] He retired in 2005, but is still active in research.\n The most important of Zenger's scientific achievements is the discovery of how to harness approximation on sparse grids for the efficient solution of elliptic partial differential equations in higher dimensions.[1]\n Beside his substantial scientific work, Zenger will be remembered for his contributions to contemporary wisdom, the most notable of which have been collected in the volume L\u00f6wenz\u00e4hnchen am Bachesrand.\n ", "tags": ["1940 births", "Living people", "20th-century German mathematicians", "People from Lindau", "Technical University of Munich faculty", "Recipients of the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "21st-century German mathematicians", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Use dmy dates from October 2013", "Articles to be expanded from November 2010", "All articles to be expanded", "Articles needing translation from German Wikipedia", "BLP articles lacking sources from May 2010", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": " Christoph Zenger\n\n\nThis article may be expanded with text translated from the corresponding article in German.
