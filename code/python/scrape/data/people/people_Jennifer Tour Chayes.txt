{"name": "Jennifer Tour Chayes", "content": "Jennifer Tour Chayes is the University of California, Berkeley Associate Provost for the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society and Dean of the School of Information. She was formerly a Technical Fellow and Managing Director of Microsoft Research New England in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which she founded in 2008, and Microsoft Research New York City, which she founded in 2012.[1]\n Chayes is best known for her work on phase transitions in discrete mathematics and computer science, structural and dynamical properties of self-engineered networks, and algorithmic game theory. She is considered one of the world's experts in the modeling and analysis of dynamically growing graphs.[2]\n Chayes joined Microsoft Research in 1997, when she co-founded the Theory Group. She received her Ph.D. in mathematical physics at Princeton University in 1983. She is Affiliate Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Washington, and was for many years Professor of Mathematics at UCLA. She is an author on almost 120 scientific papers and the inventor on more than 25 patents.\n Chayes was born in New York City[1] and grew up in White Plains, New York, the child of Iranian immigrants.  She received her B.A. in Biology and Physics from Wesleyan University in 1979 where she graduated first in her class. She received her Ph.D. in Mathematical Physics at Princeton University. She did her postdoctoral work in the Mathematics and Physics departments at Harvard and Cornell.\n She moved to UCLA as a tenured Professor of Mathematics in 1987. While she was on sabbatical at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1997, Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold, a classmate of Chayes's from Princeton, asked her to start and lead the Theory Group at Microsoft Research Redmond.[3] The Theory Group analyzes fundamental questions in theoretical computer science using techniques from statistical physics and discrete mathematics. Chayes opened Microsoft Research New England in July 2008 with Borgs. The lab is located at the Microsoft New England Research & Development Center and is pursuing new, interdisciplinary areas of research that bring together core computer scientists and social scientists to understand, model, and enable future computing and online experiences.[2]  On May 3, 2012, the New York Times reported, \"Microsoft is opening a research lab in New York City\u2026\" which Chayes will co-manage.[4][5]  The new lab also brings together computer scientists and social scientists, particularly in the areas of economics, computational and behavioral social sciences, and machine learning.\n Before joining UC Berkeley, Chayes was Managing Director of both Microsoft Research New England and Microsoft Research New York City. She has contributed to the development of methods to analyze the structure and behavior of various networks, the design of auction algorithms, and the design and analysis of various business models for the online world.\n Chayes serves on numerous institute boards, advisory committees and editorial boards, including the Turing Award Selection Committee of the Association for Computing Machinery, the Board of Trustees of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics, the Advisory Boards of the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Computer Science, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Farm Research Campus, and Women Entrepreneurs in Science and Technology.  Chayes is a past Chair of the Mathematics Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a past Vice-President of the American Mathematical Society.  She is the recipient of a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship, a Sloan Fellowship, and the UCLA Distinguished Teaching Award.[6][7][8][9]\n Chayes is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Fields Institute, the Association for Computing Machinery, and the American Mathematical Society, as well as a National Associate of the National Academies. The Association for Women in Mathematics has included her in the 2020 class of AWM Fellows for \"pioneering the way for women in the mathematical sciences to have leading technical roles in the high-tech industry; for extraordinary leadership and mentoring on behalf of women in the mathematical sciences\".[10]  She has been the recipient of many leadership awards, including one of the 2012 Anita Borg Institute Women of Vision Awards. In 2019 she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[11]\n Chayes is featured in the Notable Women in Computing cards.[12]\n Chayes married Christian Borgs in 1993 and was previously married to Lincoln Chayes whom she met at Wesleyan. She has had extremely successful collaborations with both her husbands; of her 94 papers in MathSciNet (as of February 2014), 51 are coauthored with Borgs and 37 are coauthored with Lincoln Chayes.\n ", "tags": ["21st-century American physicists", "American computer scientists", "Theoretical computer scientists", "American women computer scientists", "American women mathematicians", "American women physicists", "1956 births", "Living people", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery", "Cornell University alumni", "Harvard University alumni", "Microsoft employees", "Microsoft Research people", "Princeton University alumni", "University of California, Los Angeles faculty", "University of Washington faculty", "Wesleyan University alumni", "Scientists from New York (state)", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "20th-century American women scientists", "21st-century American women scientists", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science", "Fellows of the Association for Women in Mathematics", "Game theorists", "Sloan Research Fellows", "American people of Iranian descent", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from December 2020", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American computer scientist and mathematician\nJennifer Tour Chayesin 2017BornNew York City[1]Alma\u00a0materWesleyan University Princeton UniversityKnown\u00a0forPhase transitionsDiscrete mathematicsGraph theoryGame theory Network theoryScientific careerFieldsPhysicsMathematicsTheoretical computer scienceInstitutionsUC BerkeleyMicrosoft Research New EnglandMicrosoft Research New York CityUCLACornell UniversityHarvard UniversityThesisThe Inverse Problem, Plaquette Percolation and a Generalized Potts Model\u00a0(1983)Doctoral advisorElliott H.
