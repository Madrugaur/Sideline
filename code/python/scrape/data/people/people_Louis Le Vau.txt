{"name": "Louis Le Vau", "content": "Louis Le Vau (1612 \u2013 11 October 1670) was a French Baroque architect, who worked for Louis XIV of France.[1] He was an architect that helped develop the French Classical style in the 17th Century.[2]\n Born Louis Le Veau, he was the son of Louis Le Veau (died February 1661), a stone mason, who was active in Paris.[3] His younger brother Fran\u00e7ois Le Vau (said to have been born in 1613[4] or 1624[3]) also became an architect. The father and his two sons worked together in the 1630s and 1640s. The two brothers later changed the spelling of their surname from \"Le Veau\" to \"Le Vau\" to avoid its association with the French word veau (calf).[3]\n Le Vau started his career by designing the Hotel de Bautru in 1634.[5] By 1639, he was developing town houses (h\u00f4tels particuliers) for rich citizens such as Sainctot, Hesselin, Gillier, Gruyn des Bordes, and Jean Baptiste Lambert in the \u00eele Saint-Louis, which was being developed as a residential area.[2] His most notable work during this period is the H\u00f4tel Lambert (c.\u20091638\u20131653).[6] Le Vau also designed country houses, including the Ch\u00e2teau de Livry (c.\u20091640\u20131645), later known as the Ch\u00e2teau du Raincy.[2][7]\n In 1654, his career was advanced through his appointment as the first architect to the king,[2] succeeding Jacques Lemercier.[8] He was commissioned by Jules Cardinal Mazarin to help rebuild part of the medieval Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes.[9] Shortly after, in 1656 he was given the important commission to build the chateau of Nicolas Fouquet, Vaux-le-Vicomte with the help of Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre and Charles Le Brun.[2][10] Le Vau\u2019s most notable work in the Vaux-le-Vicomte is the oval salon facing the garden. This design, an example of a salon \u00e0 l'italienne (vaulted, two-storied room),[11] develops the idea that a simple form governs the shape of the main section of the building.[2]\n In the 1660s Le Vau helped on royal projects, such as the hospital of La Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re and the facade of the Tuileries Palace. From 1661-1664 Le Vau worked on rebuilding the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre after it burned in a fire.[2] Claude Perrault and Charles Le Brun were also involved in creating the famous fa\u00e7ade for the east front of the Louvre from 1665-1674, which acted as a prelude for Classical Architecture in the 18th century.[10]\n The most notable work of Le Vau\u2019s career was at the Palace of Versailles with which he was involved for the remainder of his life.[10] He added service wings to the forecourts and, after 1668, had rebuilt the garden fa\u00e7ade to be totally classical.[2] Le Vau was assisted by Fran\u00e7ois d'Orbay, who completed the work after Le Vau's death. Le Vau and d'Orbay's work at Versailles was later modified and extended by Jules Hardouin-Mansart.[10]\n Le Vau\u2019s designs for the Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations (now housing the Institut de France) were completed after his death by his assistant Fran\u00e7ois d' Orbay and showed unlikely rapport with Italian baroque techniques.[2][10]\n Louis Le Vau died in Paris.\n ", "tags": ["French Baroque architects", "1612 births", "1670 deaths", "Architects from Paris", "Members of the Acad\u00e9mie royale d'architecture", "Louis XIV", "17th-century French architects", "Architects from Versailles", "Articles incorporating a citation from the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia with Wikisource reference", "Articles with hCards", "No local image but image on Wikidata", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with suppressed authority control identifiers"], "raw": "Louis Le VauBornLouis Le Veauc. 1612likely Paris, FranceDied11 October 1670 (aged 57 or 58)Paris, FranceNationalityFrenchOccupationArchitectBuildingsCh\u00e2teau de VersaillesCh\u00e2teau de VincennesVaux-le-VicomteLouvre PalaceDesignOval salon at Vaux-le-Vicomte\n Louis Le Vau, c. 1650\nLouis Le Vau (1612 \u2013 11 October 1670) was a French Baroque architect, who worked for Louis XIV of France.[1] He was an architect that helped develop the French Classical style in the 17th Century.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and career\n2 Royal architect\n3 Notes\n4 Bibliography\n5 External links\n\n\nEarly life and career[edit]\nBorn Louis Le Veau, he was the son of Louis Le Veau (died February 1661), a stone mason, who was active in Paris.[3] His younger brother Fran\u00e7ois Le Vau (said to have been born in 1613[4] or 1624[3]) also became an architect.
