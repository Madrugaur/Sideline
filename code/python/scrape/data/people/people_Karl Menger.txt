{"name": "Karl Menger", "content": "Karl Menger (January 13, 1902 \u2013 October 5, 1985) was an Austrian-American mathematician. He was the son of the economist Carl Menger. He is credited with Menger's theorem.  He worked on mathematics of algebras, algebra of geometries, curve and dimension theory, etc.  Moreover, he contributed to game theory and social sciences.\n Karl Menger was a student of Hans Hahn and received his PhD from the University of Vienna in 1924. L. E. J. Brouwer invited Menger in 1925 to teach at the University of Amsterdam. In 1927, he returned to Vienna to accept a professorship there. In 1930 and 1931 he was visiting lecturer at Harvard University and The Rice Institute. From 1937 to 1946 he was a professor at the University of Notre Dame.
