{"name": "Margaret Millington", "content": "Margaret Hilary Millington (March 22, 1944 \u2013 March 1973) was an English-born mathematician.[1]\n She was born Margaret Hilary Ashworth in Halifax, Yorkshire, the daughter of the local assistant head postmaster, and was educated there. She continued her studies at St Mary's College, Durham[2] and went on to Oxford University, where she earned a PhD in 1968 with A. O. L. Atkin as her advisor.[3] Also, in 1968, she married Lieutenant A.H. Millington.[2] She was awarded a two-year Science Research Council Fellowship which allowed her to pursue research at any university. During her husband's two-year posting in Germany, she taught mathematics at an Army Education Centre there.[1]\n She died in Germany due to a brain tumour at the age of 29.[2]\n Although her career was cut short, in 1983, the London Mathematical Society organized a symposium on modular forms. During the symposium, the importance of her doctoral thesis and post-doctoral research became clear. The work that she had started during her fellowship was picked up and pursued by other mathematicians, leading to a resurgence in the field.[1]\n In a tribute to Millington, Atkin said \"I have no doubt that, had she lived, she would have made exciting original contributions to a field which has at last come into its own again, after nearly a quarter century in the doldrums, and where there are now at least twenty first rate people of her generation working actively.\"[1]\n \n This article about a British scientist is a stub.
