{"name": "Esther Szekeres", "content": "\n Esther Szekeres (Hungarian: Klein Eszter; 20 February 1910\u00a0\u2013 28 August 2005) was a Hungarian\u2013Australian mathematician.\n Esther Klein was born to Ignaz Klein in a Jewish family in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary in 1910. As a young physics student in Budapest,[1] Klein was a member of a group of Hungarians including Paul Erd\u0151s, George Szekeres and P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n that convened over interesting mathematical problems.[2]\n In 1933, Klein proposed to the group a combinatorial problem that Erd\u0151s named as the Happy Ending problem as it led to her marriage to George Szekeres in 1937, with whom she had two children.[1]\n Following the outbreak of World War II, Esther and George Szekeres emigrated to Australia after spending several years in Hongkew, a community of refugees located in Shanghai, China.[3] In Australia, they originally shared an apartment in Adelaide with M\u00e1rta Sv\u00e9d, an old school friend of Szekeres, before moving to Sydney in 1964.\n In Sydney, Esther lectured at Macquarie University and was actively involved in mathematics enrichment for high-school students. In 1984, she jointly founded a weekly mathematics enrichment meeting that has since expanded into a programme of about 30 groups that continue to meet weekly and inspire high school students throughout Australia and New Zealand.[4]\n In 2004, she and George moved back to Adelaide, where, on 28 August 2005, she and her husband died within an hour of each other.[2][1]\n In 1990, Macquarie gave Szekeres an honorary doctorate.[1]\nIn 1993, she won the BH Neumann Award of the Australian Mathematics Trust.[5]\n ", "tags": ["1910 births", "2005 deaths", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "Australian mathematicians", "Hungarian Jews", "Macquarie University faculty", "Mathematicians from Budapest", "People from Sydney", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from June 2016", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hungarian-language text", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "Hungarian\u2013Australian mathematician\n\n\nEsther SzekeresBornEsther Klein(1910-02-20)20 February 1910Budapest, Kingdom of HungaryDied28 August 2005(2005-08-28) (aged\u00a095)Adelaide, AustraliaNationalityHungarian\u2013AustralianSpouse(s)George SzekeresChildren2Academic workInstitutionsMacquarie UniversityNotable ideasHappy ending problem\n\nEsther Szekeres (Hungarian: Klein Eszter; 20 February 1910\u00a0\u2013 28 August 2005) was a Hungarian\u2013Australian mathematician.\n\nBiography[edit]\nEsther Klein was born to Ignaz Klein in a Jewish family in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary in 1910.
