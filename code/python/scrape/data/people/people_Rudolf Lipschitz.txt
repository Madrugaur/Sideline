{"name": "Rudolf Lipschitz", "content": "Rudolf Otto Sigismund Lipschitz (14 May 1832 \u2013 7 October 1903) was a German mathematician who made contributions to mathematical analysis (where he gave his name to the Lipschitz continuity condition) and differential geometry, as well as number theory, algebras with involution and classical mechanics.\n Rudolf Lipschitz was born on 14 May 1832 in K\u00f6nigsberg. He was the son of a landowner and was raised at his father's estate at B\u00f6nkein which was near K\u00f6nigsberg.[1] He entered the University of K\u00f6nigsberg when he was 15, but later moved to the University of Berlin where he studied with Gustav Dirichlet. Despite having his studies delayed by illness, in 1853 Lipschitz graduated with a PhD in Berlin.[2]\n After receiving his PhD, Lipschitz started teaching at local Gymnasiums. In 1857 he married Ida Pascha, the daughter of one of the landowners with an estate near to his father's.[1] In 1857 he earned his habilitation at the University of Bonn and remained there as a privatdozent. In 1862 Lipschitz became an extraordinary professor at the University of Breslau where he spent the following two years. In 1864 Lipschitz moved back to Bonn as a full professor, remaining there for the rest of his career. Here he examined the dissertation of Felix Klein. Lipschitz died on 7 October 1903 in Bonn.[3]\n Lipschitz discovered Clifford algebras in 1880,[4][5] two years after William K.
