He was the fourth child of Jakob Boeckman Barth (1822-1892), a lawyer and Adelaide Magdeline Lange Barth  (1828- 1897), daughter of a Danish clergyman.

In 1877, Barth started an apprenticeship in the navy yard at Karljohansvern in Horten.[1]\n\nCareer[edit]\n One of Carl G. Barth's speed-and-feed slide rules\nIn 1899, efficiency expert Frederick W. Taylor hired Barth  to work with him at Bethlehem Steel Company. Carl Barth helped to develop speed-and-feed-calculating slide rules.[2]\n\n\nCarl G. Barth... discovered the law governing the tiring effect of heavy labor... such work consists of a heavy pull or a push on the man's arms... For example, when pig iron is being handled (each pig weighing 92 pounds), a first-class workman can only be under load 43 per cent. of the day... if the workman is handling a half-pig weighing 46 pounds, he can then be under load 58 per cent. of the day... As the weight grows lighter... a load is reached which he can carry in his hands all day long without being tired out.\n[3]\nIn 1902, Taylor and Barth went to work for William Sellers at the machine tool firm of William Sellers & Company of Philadelphia. An account of their application of slide rules was published in the Transactions of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1904.[4][5]\nBarth started in 1905 on his independent career as consulting engineer.
