Yet, part of the failure can be attributed to Singer himself: the historian Michael Marrus has called him a 'latter-day Amos'; he castigated the wealthy Jews of France for their lack of support for Jewish causes in general and his journal in particular. Such personal attacks coupled with Singer's general assaults on the French social system, coming as they did from a foreigner, served to alienate him from the very Jews he wished to represent. It is not surprising that he left for New York the following year.\"\n\n^ Schwartz 1991, p. 20.\n\n^ a b Schwartz 1991, pp. 21\u201322.\n\n\nSources[edit]\n\nSchwartz, S. R.
