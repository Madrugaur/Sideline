He was a close friend of Samuel ha-Nagid, whose son Jehoseph ha-Nagid became Albalia's patron, to whom he dedicated his 1065 astronomical work Ma\u1e25beret Sod ha-Ibbur (\"The Secret of Intercalation\"), on the principles of the Jewish calendar.[2] According to Moses ibn Ezra, Albalia was also a poet and rhetorician.[3]\n After the murder of Jehoseph ha-Nagid in the 1066 Granada massacre, Albalia fled to Cordova, where he became acquainted with then-prince Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad. When he ascended the throne of Seville in May 1069, Al-Mu'tamid appointed Albalia court astronomer and astrologer.[4] At the age of thirty-one, just three years after he arrived in Seville, he was appointed leader (nasi) of the kingdom's Jewish community.[1] Continuing as a palace official for twenty years, Albalia used his influence at court to improve the status of the Jews of the kingdom.[5]\n When in 1089 the recently arrived Almoravids imposed a purge of Jewish civil servants at the court of Seville, Albalia moved to Granada, where he spent the last five years of his life. Although he had strong disagreements with Isaac Alfasi, before his death he asked his son Baruch to go to Lucena and study with him. Alfasi adopted Baruch who eventually became a well-known scholar.[6] Isaac Albalia was also the maternal grandfather of Abraham ibn Daud.\n ", "tags": ["1035 births", "1094 deaths", "11th-century rabbis", "Jews of Al-Andalus", "Medieval Jewish astrologers", "Medieval Jewish astronomers", "Medieval Jewish philosophers", "Medieval Jewish scholars", "People from C\u00f3rdoba, Spain", "Talmudists", "CS1 Hebrew-language sources (he)", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia without a Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia"], "raw": "Isaac ben Baruch AlbaliaTitleNasi of SevillePersonalBorn1035Cordova, Taifa of CordovaDied1094 (aged\u00a058\u201359)Granada, Almoravid dynastyReligionJudaism\nIsaac ben Baruch Albalia (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05b4\u05e6\u05b0\u05d7\u05b8\u05e7 \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05df \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05da\u05b0 \u05d0\u05b7\u05dc\u05d1\u05bc\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u200e, Yi\u1e63\u1e25aq ben Barukh Albalia) \n(1035, Cordova \u2013 1094, Granada) was an Andalusian Jewish mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, and Talmudist.\n\nBiography[edit]\nFirst educated by a Jew from Perigord, Albalia went on to the academy in Lucena, where he struck up a close friendship with Me'ir ibn Migash, father of Joseph ibn Migash, and then settled in Granada.[1] When barely thirty years old Albalia began to write Kupat ha-Rokhlim (\"The Store of the Merchant\"), a commentary on the Talmud.
