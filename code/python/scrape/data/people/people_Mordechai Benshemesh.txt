{"name": "Mordechai Benshemesh", "content": "\n Mordechai Benshemesh (Tel Aviv, 16 January 1911 \u2013 Melbourne, 22 December 1993) was a noted architect who practiced in Melbourne, Australia from the 1950s to the 1970s. Born in Palestine, he was one of a number of often  Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 architects who migrated to Australia both before and after WW2 who brought a different approach to architecture, as well as an appreciation of apartment living. He is best known as the architect for one of the city\u2019s first high rise  modernist apartment blocks, Edgewater Towers in St Kilda.\n Mordechai Benshemesh was born on 16 January 1911, in Tel Aviv, which at the time was part of the Ottoman Empire.[1][2] He studied at the Polytechnical School in Tel Aviv between 1930-33 before travelling to London where he completed diplomas from the British Institute of Engineering Technology and the International Correspondence School.[2] At the age of 28, perhaps sensing the coming war, he migrated to Australia, arriving on 13 June 1939.[3] He spent the next ten years working with numerous Melbourne architects; most notably Arthur W Plaisted (1940\u201341) and Harry Raymond 'Ray' Johnson (1946\u201349).[2][4] Benshemesh was naturalised as an Australian citizen on 6 December 1946.[5] While working for Johnson, he was the lead designer, producing a string of apartment projects in St Kilda and Elwood.[4] When Johnson retired from architecture Benshemesh opened his own architectural firm[4] in 1950. Beginning with the then typical 2-3 storey walk-up flats in the St Kilda -Toorak area, by the end of the decade he was designing high-rise apartments, and then office towers as well.[1]\n His late 1940s and 1950s apartment projects such as Barkly Lodge were almost Art Deco in style, characterised by cream brick in overlapping unadorned square volumes, with rectangular steel-framed windows and simple projecting balconies and stair towers. His two St Kilda high rise projects were by contrast in thin planes of all-white reinforced concrete, but still with a complex rectangular character of projecting blocks and balconies. Later projects were more typical for their period. \n Benshemesh died on 22 December 1993.[2]\n Edgewater Towers located at 12 Marine Parade, St Kilda, was constructed in 1959-1960.[6] When construction was complete the tower was advertised in The Age as \"everything you'd find in a Manhattan building, only minutes from Collins Street\".[4][7] It was the first high rise apartment block in St Kilda, and one of the first in Melbourne.[8][9] The tower supports 100 one bedroom and two bedroom apartments all with balconies, laundry and garbage disposal chutes, lounge rooms and dinettes. Throughout the 1960s numerous planning permits were permitted to allow enclosed balconies.[4][10] Edgewater Towers is an example of International Style modernism, and is constructed largely out of reinforced concrete. The City of Port Phillip's heritage listing notes that it was \"the first of St Kilda's residential highrise developments\". The listing goes further to state \"It still plays an important symbolic role in the perception of St Kilda's character and imagery.....Standing somewhat like a towering section of a stranded ocean liner, it announces St Kilda's uniquely nautical cosmopolitan zone at its southern approaches.\"[10]\n The Motel Palm Lake is located at 50-52 Queens Road, facing Albert Park. Opened on 13 December 1962 by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, Maurice Nathan,[1] it was one of Melbourne's most prestigious motels at the time. It originally had 84 suits with open balconies facing the park on one side, and a popular swimming pool terrace to the north. Facilities included on site parking, conference facilities, a nightly dinner dance and a licensed restaurant ('The Outrigger').[1] It remained in operation under a new name, Noah's Palm Lake Motel. In recent years, two more storeys and a multi-level car park surrounding the swimming pool terrace were added in phases, and the open balconies on both sides enclosed, completely changing the appearance.[1] Only the two Canary Island Palm trees that represented the Motel\u2019s name  that were planted at the entry in 1961 on the opening day by the Lord Mayor still remain.[1]\n While at Ray Johnson's:[4]\n As sole practitioner:\n Motel Palm Court (current state)\n Plan of a restaurant\n Burnett Lodge St Kilda\n ", "tags": ["1911 births", "1993 deaths", "Victorian (Australia) architects", "People from Tel Aviv", "20th-century Australian architects", "Use dmy dates from May 2014", "Use Australian English from May 2014", "All Wikipedia articles written in Australian English", "Articles with hCards"], "raw": "\n\nMordechai BenshemeshBornMordechai Benshemesh(1911-01-16)16 January 1911Tel Aviv, Ottoman PalestineDied22 December 1993(1993-12-22) (aged\u00a082)Melbourne, VictoriaNationalityPalestinianAustralian (6 December 1946)OccupationArchitectSpouse(s)HermaChildrenLisa, Joseph\nMordechai Benshemesh (Tel Aviv, 16 January 1911 \u2013 Melbourne, 22 December 1993) was a noted architect who practiced in Melbourne, Australia from the 1950s to the 1970s.
