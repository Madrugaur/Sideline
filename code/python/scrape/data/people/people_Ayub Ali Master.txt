He came to the United Kingdom as an ex-lascar.[7]\n On a ship going from the United States to the Tilbury Docks of England, Ali arrived in the United Kingdom in late 1919.[8] During this time, there was a sizeable minority of British Asians and a high demand for South Asian cuisine as there were not many restaurants serving home cuisines.[9] Ali started his career in 1920 by founding the Shah Jalal Restaurant and Coffee House in Commercial Street.[10] The restaurant was popular to a great extent and served as a hub for the British Asian community.[1] Many important meetings were also held here such as one for the India League launched by Krishna Menon on 13 June 1943 and around eighty Asian lascars and factory workers as well as three Europeans were present.[7] Other figures who frequented the restaurant include Narayana Menon and Mulk Raj Anand.[11]\n Ali moved to 13 Sandys Row in the East End of London in 1945.[12] He continued living there until 1959.[13] Through the restaurant and his home, Ali was also able to support other ex-lascars and help them find employment.[14] He would provide food, education and shelter gratis in his own home as well.[5] Ali was proficient in the English language, and so was able to also write letters for the men and allow them to also send remittances back to their families abroad.[15] It is considered that during this period, the nickname of \"Master\" was ascribed to Ali due to his literary ability.\n On 9 May 1943, Ali and his acquaintance Shah Abdul Majid Qureshi founded the Indian Seamen's Union (not to be confused with the Calcutta-based organisation of the same name) with intentions to promote the social welfare of British Asians (mostly those with lascar or working-class backgrounds) in Christian Street.[16][17] It ensured the rights of the Asians and also allowed them to communicate to their relatives back home.[18] Its first meeting took place on 14 July 1943 in King's Hall, Commercial Street, London.[19] The meeting attracted mostly Bengali Muslims but dozens of Europeans were also present. Later, the organisation was renamed to the Indian Seamen's Welfare League to sound less political.[20][21] V. K. Krishna Menon also made Ali the treasurer of the East End branch of his India League. Ali was also the president of the United Kingdom Muslim League having links with Liaquat Ali Khan and Mohammad Ali Jinnah.[22]\n At a later stage in his life, Ali founded a travel agency business in his house called Orient Travels. This was later moved to Brick Lane, which has now become the capital of the British Bangladeshi community. He then returned to his home in Achol, Jagannathpur in the newly independent country of Bangladesh where he became a member of his local Union Parishad.[6] He renamed his village of Achol to Hason-Fatehpur.[23]\n Ayub Ali passed away during his return to Bangladesh on 1 April 1980 in Hason-Fatehpur.[24] He had two sons and a daughter.\n ", "tags": ["British restaurateurs", "1880 births", "1980 deaths", "British Muslims", "Bangladeshi emigrants to England", "British chefs", "Bangladeshi businesspeople", "People from Shoreditch", "British chief executives", "British company founders", "Chefs of Indian cuisine", "20th-century British businesspeople", "English Muslims", "People from Jagannathpur Upazila", "19th-century Muslims", "20th-century Muslims", "All India Muslim League members", "CS1 Bengali-language sources (bn)", "Use dmy dates from February 2020", "Pages using Infobox person with deprecated parameter home town", "Infobox person using home town", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Bengali-language text"], "raw": "\n\nAyub AliMaster\u0986\u0987\u09af\u09bc\u09c1\u09ac \u0986\u09b2\u09c0 \u09ae\u09be\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0Born1 January 1880 (estimate)Achol, Jagannathpur, Sylhet District, North-East Frontier, British RajDied1 April 1980(1980-04-01) (aged\u00a099\u2013100)Hason-Fatehpur, Jagannathpur Upazila, Sunamganj District, BangladeshNationalityBritish BangladeshiCitizenshipUnited KingdomOccupationBusinessman, social worker, treasurer, politicianOrganizationIndian Seamen's Welfare LeagueKnown\u00a0forOne of the early founders of the British Bangladeshi communityPolitical partyUnited Kingdom Muslim LeagueBoard member\u00a0ofIndia LeagueChildrenAsiful Haque (Son), Ahbab Husain (Son) & Rezia Husain (Daughter)ParentsAbu Ayub Ali (father)Umm Ayub Ali (mother)RelativesSyeda Sameena Naaz (Granddaughter), Zaki Syed kaiser Husein (Grandson), Saadi Al-Sayed Hussain (Grandson), MD Nazmul Husain (Grandson), Jebu Nessa (Granddaughter), Bodrun Nessa (Granddaughter) & MD Makbul Husain (Grandson), Ashok Ali (great grandson)FamilyHusain family\nAyub Ali Master (Bengali: \u0986\u0987\u09af\u09bc\u09c1\u09ac \u0986\u09b2\u09c0 \u09ae\u09be\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0; died 1980), was an early British Bangladeshi social reformer, politician and entrepreneur.[1] He is notable for pioneering social welfare work for many early British Asians.[2] He established a boardinghouse known as \"Number 13\" in his home which provided many facilities for British Asians.[3] He is one of the earliest of Sylhetis to arrive in the United Kingdom, now hosting one of the largest Bangladeshi diaspora communities outside of Bangladesh and due to this, he was amongst the famous household names in the Sylhet region during his time referred to as the brave jahazis (sailors).[4][5] His family is also notable as entrepreneurs and businessmen.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Legacy\n4 See also\n5 References\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nAli was born into a Bengali Muslim family from the Achol village of Jagannathpur in the Sylhet District of the British Raj's North-East Frontier.[6] It is unknown how, but he later migrated to the United States of America.
