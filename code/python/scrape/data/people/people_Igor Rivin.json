{"name": "Igor Rivin", "content": "Igor Rivin (born 1961 in Moscow, USSR) is a Russian-Canadian mathematician, \nworking in various fields of pure and applied mathematics, computer science, \nand materials science. He was the Regius Professor of Mathematics at the University of St. Andrews from 2015 to 2017, and was   the chief research officer at Cryptos Fund until 2019. He is doing research for Edgestream LP, in addition to his academic work.\n He received his B.Sc. (Hon) in mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1981, and his Ph.D. in 1986 from Princeton University under the direction of William Thurston.  Following his doctorate, Rivin directed development of QLISP and the Mathematica kernel, before returning to academia in 1992, where he held positions at the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques, the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of Melbourne, Warwick, and Caltech.  Since 1999, Rivin has been professor of mathematics at Temple University.  In 2015, he was appointed Regius Professor of Mathematics at the University of St. Andrews.\n Rivin's PhD thesis[1][2] and a series of extensions[3][4][5] characterized hyperbolic 3-dimensional polyhedra in terms of their dihedral angles, resolving a long-standing open question of Jakob Steiner on the inscribable combinatorial types.
