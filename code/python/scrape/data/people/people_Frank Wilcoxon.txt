{"name": "Frank Wilcoxon", "content": "Frank Wilcoxon (2 September 1892 \u2013 18 November 1965) was a chemist and statistician, known for the development of several statistical tests.[1]\n Frank Wilcoxon was born to American parents on 2 September, 1892 in County Cork, Ireland.[2] He grew up in Catskill, New York, but received part of his education in England. In 1917, he graduated from Pennsylvania Military College with a B.Sc. After the First World War he entered graduate studies, first at Rutgers University, where he was awarded an M.S. in chemistry in 1921, and then at Cornell University, gaining a Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1924.\n Wilcoxon entered a research career, working at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research from 1925 to 1941. He then moved to the Atlas Powder Company, where he designed and directed the Control Laboratory, before joining the American Cyanamid Company in 1943. During this time he developed an interest in inferential statistics through the study of R. A. Fisher's 1925 text, Statistical Methods for Research Workers. He retired in 1957.\n Over his career Wilcoxon published over 70 papers.[3] His most well-known paper[4] contained the two new statistical tests that still bear his name, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. These are non-parametric alternatives to the unpaired and paired Student's t-tests respectively. He died on November 18, 1965.\n ", "tags": ["1892 births", "1965 deaths", "American physical chemists", "American statisticians", "Irish statisticians", "Widener University alumni", "Rutgers University alumni", "Cornell University alumni", "Fellows of the American Statistical Association", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Frank WilcoxonBorn(1892-09-02)2 September 1892County Cork, IrelandDied18 November 1965(1965-11-18) (aged\u00a073)Tallahassee, Florida, USANationalityIrish AmericanAlma\u00a0materCornell UniversityRutgers UniversityScientific careerFieldsChemistryStatisticsInstitutionsAmerican Cyanamid Company\n\nFrank Wilcoxon (2 September 1892 \u2013 18 November 1965) was a chemist and statistician, known for the development of several statistical tests.[1]\nFrank Wilcoxon was born to American parents on 2 September, 1892 in County Cork, Ireland.[2] He grew up in Catskill, New York, but received part of his education in England.
