{"name": "Maximilian Hell", "content": "Maximilian Hell (Hungarian: Hell Miksa) (May 15, 1720 \u2013 April 14, 1792) was an astronomer and an ordained Jesuit priest from the Kingdom of Hungary.\n Born as Rudolf Maximilian H\u00f6ll in Selmecb\u00e1nya, Hont County, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica, Slovakia),[5] but later changed his surname to Hell. He was the third son from the second marriage of his father Matthias Cornelius Hell (Matth\u00e4us Kornelius Hell) and his mother Julianna Staindl. The couple had a total of 22 children. Registry entries indicate that the family was of German descent, while Maximilian Hell later in life (ca. 1750) is known to declare himself as Hungarian.\n The place of birth of Maximilian's father is unknown; the settlements K\u00f6rm\u00f6cb\u00e1nya (today Kremnica), Schlagenwald, (today Horn\u00ed Slavkov) or Schlackenwerth (today Ostrov nad Oh\u0159\u00ed) are most frequently given. Born in a mixed German, Hungarian and Slovak town,[5] he presumably knew Slovak to a certain extent[5] and he probably understood Hungarian,[5] but his mother tongue was German.[5] Even so, Hell considered himself a Hungarian.[5][6] Hell with another Jesuit priest, J\u00e1nos Sajnovics tried to explore the already widely discussed but insufficiently documented affinity between the language of the Sami, Finns and the Hungarians during and after their residency in Vard\u00f8. (Demonstratio idioma Ungarorum et Lapponum idem esse, 1770 Copenhagen)[1][7][8]\n Hell became the director of the Vienna Observatory in 1756.[9]  He published the astronomical tables Ephemerides astronomicae ad meridianum Vindobonemsem (\"Ephemerides for the Meridian of Vienna\"). He and his assistant J\u00e1nos Sajnovics went to Vard\u00f8 in the far north of Norway (then part of Denmark-Norway) to observe the 1769 transit of Venus. He was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters on October 13, 1769. This society also funded the publication of his 1770 account of the Venus passage Observatio transitus Veneris ante discum Solis die 3. Junii anno 1769 (Copenhagen, 1770).[10]\n There was some controversy about Hell's observations of the transit of Venus because he stayed in Norway for eight months, collecting non-astronomical scientific data about the arctic regions for a planned encyclopedia (which never appeared, in part due to the suppression of the Jesuit order).  The publication of his results was delayed, and some (notably Joseph Johann Littrow) accused Hell posthumously of falsifying his results.  However, Simon Newcomb carefully studied Hell's notebooks and exonerated him a century after his death in Vienna.\n Besides astronomy, Hell also had an interest in magnet therapy (the alleged healing power of magnets), although it was Franz Anton Mesmer who went further with this and received most of the credit.\n In 1771, Hell was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n The crater Hell on the Moon is named after him.\n ", "tags": ["1720 births", "1792 deaths", "18th-century astronomers", "Hungarian astronomers", "Hungarian Jesuits", "Hungarian Roman Catholics", "German Roman Catholics", "Hungarian scientists", "Catholic clergy scientists", "Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences", "Jesuit scientists", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hungarian-language text", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Maximilian HellHell MiksaMaximilian Hell dressed in Sami clothing during his stay at Vard\u00f8 in 1769 to observe the Venus transit[1]Born(1720-05-15)May 15, 1720Selmecb\u00e1nya, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica, Slovakia)DiedApril 14, 1792(1792-04-14) (aged\u00a071)ViennaNationalityHungarian[1][2][3][4]Scientific careerFieldsAstronomy\n\nMaximilian Hell (Hungarian: Hell Miksa) (May 15, 1720 \u2013 April 14, 1792) was an astronomer and an ordained Jesuit priest from the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Works\n3 Literature\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nBorn as Rudolf Maximilian H\u00f6ll in Selmecb\u00e1nya, Hont County, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica, Slovakia),[5] but later changed his surname to Hell.
