{"name": "Clifford V. Johnson", "content": "\n Clifford Victor Johnson (born 5 March 1968 in London, UK)[1] is an English theoretical physicist and professor at the University of Southern California Department of Physics and Astronomy.\n Johnson lived in Montserrat for 10 years.[2] Johnson's research focus is in superstring theory and particle physics, specifically related to strongly coupled phenomena.[3][4] He has previously worked at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University.[5] He received the 2005 Maxwell Medal and Prize from the Institute of Physics, \"For his outstanding contribution to string theory, quantum gravity and its interface with strongly coupled field theory, in particular for his work on understanding the censorship of singularities and the thermodynamic properties of quantum spacetime.\"[6][7][8][9] He received a National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 1997.[5] In 2005, the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education listed Clifford Johnson as the most highly cited black professor of mathematics or a related field at an American university or college.[10]\n He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics from Imperial College London in 1989 and he completed his Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Southampton in 1992.\n He also actively works to promote science in the public and physics outreach. As part of this effort, he regularly appears on the History Channel series The Universe and acts as a science consultant for the Discovery Channel.[11] Johnson founded the African Summer Theory Institute, \"which brings teachers, researchers, and students of all levels together for a month-long conference on a science topic\u2014a different one every year\u2014to discuss, to network, and, of course, to learn.\"[12]\n He has also served as a science consultant for science fiction films and television shows including Avengers: Endgame and Star Trek: Discovery. He made a brief cameo appearance in the 2020 film Palm Springs.[13]\n ", "tags": ["1968 births", "Alumni of Imperial College London", "Alumni of the University of Southampton", "Living people", "British string theorists", "English physicists", "University of Southern California faculty", "Theoretical physicists", "Maxwell Medal and Prize recipients", "Black British academics", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from August 2016", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "British physicist\n\n\nClifford Victor JohnsonBorn (1968-03-05) 5 March 1968 (age\u00a053)London, United KingdomNationalityBritishAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Southampton (PhD)  Imperial College London (BSc)AwardsMaxwell Medal and Prize (2005)Scientific careerFieldstheoretical physics, particle physics, mathematical physicsInstitutionsUniversity of Southern California  Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics  University of California, Santa Barbara  Institute for Advanced Study  Princeton University\n\nClifford Victor Johnson (born 5 March 1968 in London, UK)[1] is an English theoretical physicist and professor at the University of Southern California Department of Physics and Astronomy.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Bibliography\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nJohnson lived in Montserrat for 10 years.[2] Johnson's research focus is in superstring theory and particle physics, specifically related to strongly coupled phenomena.[3][4] He has previously worked at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University.[5] He received the 2005 Maxwell Medal and Prize from the Institute of Physics, \"For his outstanding contribution to string theory, quantum gravity and its interface with strongly coupled field theory, in particular for his work on understanding the censorship of singularities and the thermodynamic properties of quantum spacetime.\"[6][7][8][9] He received a National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 1997.[5] In 2005, the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education listed Clifford Johnson as the most highly cited black professor of mathematics or a related field at an American university or college.[10]\nHe graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics from Imperial College London in 1989 and he completed his Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Southampton in 1992.\nHe also actively works to promote science in the public and physics outreach.
