{"name": "Kalpana Chawla", "content": "\n Kalpana Chawla (17 March 1962 \u2013 1 February 2003) was an American astronaut, engineer, and the first woman of Indian origin to go to space.[3][4] She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator. In 2003, Chawla was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster when the spacecraft disintegrated during its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.[5] Chawla was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor,[6] and several streets, universities, and institutions have been named in her honor.[7][8][9] She is regarded as a national hero in India.[10]\n Kalpana Chawla was born on 17 March 1962, in Karnal of present-day Haryana, India, but her official date of birth was altered to 1 July 1961, to allow her to become eligible for the matriculation exam.[11] As a child, she was fascinated by aeroplanes and flying.[12] She went to local flying clubs and watched planes with her father.[13] After getting a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College, India, she moved to the United States in 1982 and obtained a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1984.[14] Chawla went on to earn a second Masters in 1986 and a PhD[15] in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the University of Colorado Boulder.\n Chawla was married to Jean-Pierre Harrison.[16][17][18]\n In 1988, she began working at NASA Ames Research Center, where she did computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research on vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) concepts. Much of Chawla's research is included in technical journals and conference papers. In 1993, she joined Overset Methods, Inc. as Vice President and Research Scientist specializing in simulation of moving multiple body problems. Chawla held a Certificated Flight Instructor rating for airplanes, gliders and Commercial Pilot licenses for single and multi-engine airplanes, seaplanes and gliders. After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1991, Chawla applied for the NASA Astronaut Corps.[19] She joined the corps in March 1995 and was selected for her first flight in 1996.\n Her first space mission began on 19 November 1997, as part of the six-astronaut crew that flew the Space Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87. Chawla was the first Indian woman to go in space. She spoke the following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space, \"You are just your intelligence.\" On her first mission, Chawla traveled over 10.4 million miles (16737177.6\u00a0km) in 252 orbits of the earth, logging more than 372 hours (15 days and 12 hours) in space.[6] During STS-87, she was responsible for deploying the Spartan Satellite which malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Takao Doi to capture the satellite. A five-month NASA investigation fully exonerated[citation needed] Chawla by identifying errors in software interfaces and the defined procedures of the flight crew and ground control. After the completion of STS-87 post-flight activities, Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the astronaut office to work on the space station.\n In 2001, Chawla was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of STS-107. This mission was repeatedly delayed due to scheduling conflicts and technical problems such as the July 2002 discovery of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners. On 16 January 2003, Chawla finally returned to space aboard Space Shuttle Columbia on the ill-fated STS-107 mission. The crew performed nearly 80 experiments studying Earth and space science, advanced technology development, and astronaut health and safety. During the launch of STS-107, Columbia's 28th mission, a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left-wing of the orbiter. Previous shuttle launches had seen minor damage from foam shedding,[20] but some engineers suspected that the damage to Columbia was more serious. NASA managers limited the investigation, reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed.[21] When Columbia re-entered the atmosphere of Earth, the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate and destroy the internal wing structure, which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart.[22] After the disaster, Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years, similar to the aftermath of the Challenger disaster. Construction of the International Space Station (ISS) was put on hold; the station relied entirely on the Russian Roscosmos State Corporation for resupply for 29 months until Shuttle flights resumed with STS-114 and 41 months for crew rotation.\n Chawla died on 1 February 2003, in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, along with the other six crew members, when the Columbia disintegrated over Texas during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, shortly before it was scheduled to conclude its 28th mission, STS-107.[23] \nHer remains were identified along with those of the rest of the crew members and were cremated and scattered at Zion National Park in Utah in accordance with her wishes.[24]\n ", "tags": ["Recipients of the Congressional Space Medal of Honor", "Kalpana Chawla", "1962 births", "2003 deaths", "Space Shuttle Columbia disaster", "American aerospace engineers", "American astronauts", "American people of Punjabi descent", "Aviators killed in aviation accidents or incidents in the United States", "Women astronauts", "Indian emigrants to the United States", "People from Karnal", "University of Colorado alumni", "University of Texas at Arlington alumni", "Punjab Engineering College alumni", "Panjab University alumni", "Amateur radio women", "Amateur radio people", "NASA civilian astronauts", "20th-century American women", "Age controversies", "American people of Indian descent", "20th-century American scientists", "Scientists from Haryana", "21st-century American women", "Women scientists from Punjab, India", "Engineers from Punjab, India", "Commercial aviators", "American female commercial aviators", "American female aviators", "Space Shuttle program astronauts", "Naturalized citizens of the United States", "American aviators of Asian descent", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from December 2020", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from April 2018", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American astronaut\n\n\nKalpana ChawlaBorn(1961-03-17)17 March 1961[1]Karnal, East Punjab, IndiaDied1 February 2003(2003-02-01) (aged\u00a041)Aboard Space Shuttle Columbia over Texas, U.S.A.CitizenshipIndia (1962-1991)\nUnited States (1991-2003)Alma\u00a0materPunjab Engineering College (BE)  University of Texas at Arlington (MS)  University of Colorado at Boulder (MS, PhD)Awards  Space careerTime in space31 days, 14 hours, 54 minutes[2]Selection1994 NASA GroupMissionsSTS-87, STS-107Mission insignia \n\nKalpana Chawla (17 March 1962 \u2013 1 February 2003) was an American astronaut, engineer, and the first woman of Indian origin to go to space.[3][4] She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator.

Kalpana Chawla\" after her.[25][26][27]\nAsteroid 51826 Kalpana chawla, one of seven named after the Columbia's crew.[28]\nOn 5 February 2003, the Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced that the meteorological series of satellites, MetSat, was to be renamed \"Kalpana\". The first satellite of the series, \"MetSat-1\", launched by India on 12 September 2002 was renamed \"Kalpana-1\".[29]\n74th Street in the \"Little India\" of Jackson Heights, Queens, New York City, New York, United States has been renamed \"Kalpana Chawla Way\" in her honor.[7]\nThe Kalpana Chawla Award was instituted by the Government of Karnataka in 2004 to recognize young women scientists.[30]\nNASA has dedicated a supercomputer to Chawla.[31]\nOne of Florida Institute of Technology's student apartment complexes, Columbia Village Suites, has halls named after each of the astronauts, including Chawla.\nThe NASA Mars Exploration Rover mission has named seven peaks in a chain of hills, named the Columbia Hills, after each of the seven astronauts lost in the Columbia shuttle disaster. One of them is Chawla Hill, named after Chawla.\nSteve Morse from the band Deep Purple created the song \"Contact Lost\" in memory of the Columbia tragedy. Chawla knew Morse and took the band\u2019s Machine Head (album), featuring the song Space Truckin\u2019 with her on the mission. Morse\u2019s tribute song can be found on the album Bananas.[32]\nNovelist Peter David named a shuttlecraft, the Chawla, after the astronaut in his 2007 Star Trek novel, Star Trek: The Next Generation: Before Dishonor.[33]\nThe Kalpana Chawla ISU Scholarship fund was founded by alumni of the International Space University (ISU) in 2010 to support Indian women's participation in international space education programs.[34]\nThe Kalpana Chawla Memorial Scholarship program was instituted by the Indian Students Association (ISA) at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) in 2005 for meritorious graduate students.[35]\nThe Kalpana Chawla Outstanding Recent Alumni Award at the University of Colorado, given since 1983, was renamed after Chawla.[36]\nThe University of Texas at Arlington, where Chawla obtained a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering in 1984, opened a dormitory named Kalpana Chawla Hall in 2004.[37] Kalpana Chawla Hall, University of Texas Arlington In addition, the university dedicated the Kalpana Chawla Memorial on 3 May 2010, in Nedderman Hall, one of the primary buildings in the College of Engineering.[38]\nThe girls' hostel at Punjab Engineering College is named after Chawla. In addition, an award of INR twenty-five thousand, a medal, and a certificate is instituted for the best student in the Aeronautical Engineering department.[39]\nThe Government of Haryana established the Kalpana Chawla Planetarium in Jyotisar, Kurukshetra.[9]\nThe Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, named the Kalpana Chawla Space Technology Cell in her honor.[8][40]\nDelhi Technological University named a girls' hostel block after Chawla.[41]\nA military housing development at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, has been named Columbia Colony and includes a street named Chawla Way.\nA hostel block in Pondicherry University has been named after Chawla.[42]\nKalpana Chawla Government Medical College (KCGMC) is a Medical College located in Karnal, Haryana, India named after Chawla.\nThe National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra named a girls' hostel after Chawla.\nThe National Institute of Technology Bhopal named girl's hostel named KALPANA CHAWLA BHAWAN.
