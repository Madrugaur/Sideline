{"name": "Shafi Goldwasser", "content": "\n Shafrira Goldwasser (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05d5\u05e1\u05e8\u200e; born 1959) is an Israeli-American computer scientist and winner of the Turing Award in 2012. She is the RSA Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT,[5] a professor of mathematical sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, co-founder and chief scientist of Duality Technologies[6] and the director of the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing in Berkeley, CA.[7][8][9][10] She was on the Mathematical Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2020.[11]\n Born in New York City, Goldwasser obtained her Bachelor of Science degree in 1979 in mathematics and science from Carnegie Mellon University. For her postgraduate study, she did a Master of Science degree in 1981 followed by a PhD (1984) in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley supervised by Manuel Blum. [4]\n Goldwasser joined MIT in 1983, and in 1997 became the first holder of the RSA Professorship.  She became a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science, concurrent to her professorship at MIT, in 1993. She is a member of the theory of computation group at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[12] Goldwasser was a co-recipient of the 2012 Turing Award.[13] \nOn January 1, 2018, Goldwasser became the director of the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at the University of California, Berkeley.[14]\n Since November 2016, Goldwasser is chief scientist and co-Founder of Duality Technologies, a US-based start-up which offers secure data analytics using advanced cryptographic techniques.[15] She is also a scientific advisor for several technology startups in the security area, including QED-it, specializing in the Zero Knowledge Blockchain, and Algorand, a pure proof-of-stake blockchain.[16]\n Goldwasser's research areas include computational complexity theory, cryptography and computational number theory. \nShe is the co-inventor of probabilistic encryption,[17] which set up and achieved the gold standard for security for data encryption. \nShe is the co-inventor of zero-knowledge proofs, which probabilistically and interactively demonstrate the validity of an assertion without conveying any additional knowledge, and are a key tool in the design of cryptographic protocols. Her work in complexity theory includes the classification of approximation problems, showing that some problems in NP remain hard even when only an approximate solution is needed,[18] and pioneering methods for delegating computations to untrusted servers.[19] Her work in number theory includes the invention with Joe Kilian of primality proving using elliptic curves.[20]\n Goldwasser was awarded the 2012 Turing Award along with Silvio Micali for their work in the field of cryptography.[21]\nGoldwasser has twice won the G\u00f6del Prize in theoretical computer science: first in 1993 (for \"The knowledge complexity of interactive proof systems\"),[22] and again in 2001 (for Interactive Proofs and the Hardness of Approximating Cliques).[23] Other awards include the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award (1996) for outstanding young computer professional of the year and the RSA Award for Excellence in Mathematics (1998) for outstanding mathematical contributions to cryptography. In 2001 she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and  in 2002 she gave a plenary lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing.[24] In 2004 she was elected to the National Academy of Science, and in 2005 to the National Academy of Engineering. She was selected as an IACR Fellow in 2007.  Goldwasser received the 2008-2009 Athena Lecturer Award of the Association for Computing Machinery's Committee on Women in Computing.[25] She is the recipient of The Franklin Institute's 2010 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science.[26] She received the IEEE Emanuel R. Piore Award in 2011.[27]\nShe received the 2018 Frontier of Knowledge  award together with Micali, Rivest  and Shamir.[28]\nShe was elected as an ACM Fellow in 2017.[29] In July 2017, she was a plenary lecturer in the Mathematical Congress of the Americas.[30]\nIn 2018, she was awarded an honorary degree by her alma mater, Carnegie Mellon University.[31] On 26 June 2019 Goldwasser was awarded an honorary doctorate of science by the University of Oxford.[32]\n Goldwasser is featured in the Notable Women in Computing cards.[33] She won the Suffrage Science award in 2016.[3]\n ", "tags": ["American computer scientists", "Israeli computer scientists", "Theoretical computer scientists", "1959 births", "Living people", "Modern cryptographers", "Israeli women computer scientists", "American women mathematicians", "Israeli women scientists", "Israeli women academics", "Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery", "International Association for Cryptologic Research fellows", "Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Foreign Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences", "G\u00f6del Prize laureates", "Grace Murray Hopper Award laureates", "Turing Award laureates", "Weizmann Institute of Science faculty", "Carnegie Mellon University alumni", "University of California, Berkeley alumni", "American emigrants to Israel", "Naturalized citizens of Israel", "Israeli Jews", "Jewish American scientists", "MIT School of Engineering faculty", "Scientists from New York City", "20th-century American engineers", "21st-century American engineers", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century mathematicians", "20th-century American scientists", "21st-century American scientists", "20th-century American women scientists", "21st-century American women scientists", "Simons Investigator", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Mathematicians from New York (state)", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from October 2020", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Articles containing explicitly cited English-language text", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American computer scientist\n\n\nShafi GoldwasserShafi Goldwasser in 2010BornHebrew: \u05e9\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05d5\u05e1\u05e8\u200eEnglish: Shafrira Goldwasser1959 (age\u00a061\u201362)New York City, New York, U.S.NationalityIsraeli AmericanAlma\u00a0mater\nCarnegie Mellon University\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\nKnown\u00a0for\nBlum\u2013Goldwasser cryptosystem\nGoldwasser\u2013Micali cryptosystem[1]\nAwards\nGrace Murray Hopper Award (1996)\nG\u00f6del Prize (1993, 2001)\nMember of the National Academy of Sciences (2004)\nIEEE Emanuel R.
