He discovered the ninth perfect number and its odd prime factor, the ninth Mersenne prime.

Upon graduation, Pervushin was required to become a priest; he stayed for some time in Perm, then moved to a remote village of Zamaraevo, some 150 miles from Ekaterinburg, where he lived for 25 years.[4]\n In Zamaraevo, Pervushin founded a rural school in 1859.[2]\nHe moved to the nearby town of Shadrinsk in 1883, where he published an article that ridiculed the local government.
