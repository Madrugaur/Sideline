{"name": "Carl St\u00f8rmer", "content": "\n Fredrik Carl M\u00fclertz St\u00f8rmer[needs Norwegian IPA] (3 September 1874 \u2013 13 August 1957) was a Norwegian mathematician and astrophysicist. In mathematics, he is known for his work in number theory, including the calculation of \u03c0 and St\u00f8rmer's theorem on consecutive smooth numbers. In physics, he is known for studying the movement of charged particles in the magnetosphere and the formation of aurorae, and for his book on these subjects, From the Depths of Space to the Heart of the Atom. He worked for many years as a professor of mathematics at the University of Oslo in Norway. A crater on the far side of the moon is named after him.\n St\u00f8rmer was born on 3 September 1874 in Skien, the only child of a pharmacist Georg Ludvig St\u00f8rmer (1842\u20131930) and Elisabeth Amalie Johanne Henriette M\u00fclertz (1844\u20131916).[1][2] His uncle was the entrepreneur and inventor Henrik Christian Fredrik St\u00f8rmer.[1][2]\n St\u00f8rmer studied mathematics at the Royal Frederick University in Kristiania, Norway (now the University of Oslo, in Oslo) from 1892 to 1897, earning the rank of candidatus realium in 1898. He then studied with Picard, Poincar\u00e9, Painlev\u00e9, Jordan, Darboux, and Goursat at the Sorbonne in Paris from 1898 to 1900. He returned to Kristiania in 1900 as a research fellow in mathematics, visited the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1902, and returned to Kristiania in 1903, where he was appointed as a professor of mathematics, a position he held for 43 years. After he received a permanent position in Kristiania, St\u00f8rmer published his subsequent writings under a shortened version of his name, Carl St\u00f8rmer. In 1918, he was elected as the first president of the newly formed Norwegian Mathematical Society. He participated regularly in Scandinavian mathematical congresses, and was president of the 1936 International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo (from 1924 the new name of Kristiania). St\u00f8rmer was also affiliated with the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, which was founded in 1934. He died on 13 August 1957, at Blindern.[1][3][4][5]\n He was also an amateur street photographer,[6] beginning in his student days. Near the age of 70 he put on an exhibition in Oslo of the photographs of celebrities that he had taken over the years. For instance it included one of Henrik Ibsen strolling down Karl Johans gate, the main road in Oslo.[1] He was also a supervisory council member of the insurance company Forsikringsselskapet Norden.[7]\n In February 1900 he married consul's daughter Ada Clauson (1877\u20131973), with whom he eventually had five children.[4] Their son Leif St\u00f8rmer became a professor of historical geology at the University of Oslo.[2] His daughter Henny married landowner Carl Otto L\u00f8venskiold.[8] Carl St\u00f8rmer is also the grandfather of the mathematician Erling St\u00f8rmer.[9][10]\n St\u00f8rmer's first mathematical publication, published when he was a beginning student at the age of 18, concerned trigonometric series generalizing the Taylor expansion of the arcsine function. He revisited this problem a few years later. Next, he systematically investigated Machin-like formula by which the number \u03c0 may be represented as a rational combination of the so-called \"Gregory numbers\" of the form arctan 1/n. Machin's original formula,\n is of this type, and St\u00f8rmer showed that there were three other ways of representing \u03c0 as a rational combination of two Gregory numbers. He then investigated combinations of three Gregory numbers, and found 102 representations of \u03c0 of this form, but was unable to determine whether there might be additional solutions of this type.[3] These representations led to fast algorithms for computing numerical approximations of \u03c0. In particular, a four-term representation found by St\u00f8rmer,\n was used in a record-setting calculation of \u03c0 to 1,241,100,000,000 decimal digits in 2002 by Yasumasa Kanada.[11] St\u00f8rmer is also noted for the St\u00f8rmer numbers, which arose from the decomposition of Gregory numbers in St\u00f8rmer's work.[12]\n St\u00f8rmer's theorem, which he proved in 1897, shows that, for any finite set P of prime numbers, there are only finitely many pairs of consecutive integers having only the numbers from P as their prime factors. In addition, St\u00f8rmer describes an algorithm for finding all such pairs. The superparticular ratios generated by these consecutive pairs are of particular importance in music theory.[13] St\u00f8rmer proves this theorem by reducing the problem to a finite set of Pell equations, and the theorem itself can also be interpreted as describing the possible factorizations of solutions to Pell's equation. Chapman quotes Louis Mordell as saying \"His result is very pretty, and there are many applications of it.\"[1]\n Additional subjects of St\u00f8rmer's mathematical research included Lie groups, the gamma function, and Diophantine approximation of algebraic numbers and of the transcendental numbers arising from elliptic functions. From 1905 St\u00f8rmer was an editor of the journal Acta Mathematica, and he was also an editor of the posthumously-published mathematical works of Niels Henrik Abel and Sophus Lie.[1][3]\n From 1903, when St\u00f8rmer first observed Kristian Birkeland's experimental attempts to explain the aurora borealis, he was fascinated by aurorae and related phenomena. His first work on the subject attempted to model mathematically the paths taken by charged particles perturbed by the influence of a magnetized sphere, and St\u00f8rmer eventually published over 48 papers on the motion of charged particles.[14] By modeling the problem using differential equations and polar coordinates, St\u00f8rmer was able to show that the radius of curvature of any particle's path is proportional to the square of its distance from the sphere's center. To solve the resulting differential equations numerically, he used Verlet integration, which is therefore also known as St\u00f6rmer's method.[3] Ernst Br\u00fcche and Willard Harrison Bennett verified experimentally St\u00f8rmer's predicted particle motions; Bennett called his experimental apparatus \"St\u00f6rmertron\" in honor of St\u00f8rmer.[1] St\u00f8rmer's calculations showed that small variations in the trajectories of particles approaching the earth would be magnified by the effects of the Earth's magnetic field, explaining the convoluted shapes of aurorae.[15] St\u00f8rmer also considered the possibility that particles might be trapped within the geomagnetic field, and worked out the orbits of these trapped particles. St\u00f8rmer's work on this subject applies to what are today called the magnetospheric ring current[1] and Van Allen radiation belts.[16]\n As well as modeling these phenomena mathematically, St\u00f8rmer took many photographs of aurorae, from 20 different observatories across Norway. He measured their heights and latitudes by triangulation from multiple observatories, and showed that the aurora are typically as high as 100 kilometers above ground. He classified them by their shapes, and discovered in 1926 the \"solar-illuminated aurora\", a phenomenon that can occur at twilight when the upper parts of an aurora are lit by the sun; these aurorae can be as high as 1000\u00a0km above ground.[17][18]\n St\u00f8rmer's book, From the Depths of Space to the Heart of the Atom, describing his work in this area, was translated into five different languages from the original Norwegian.[3] A second book, The Polar Aurora (Oxford Press, 1955), contains both his experimental work on aurorae and his mathematical attempts to model them. In his review of this book, Canadian astronomer John F. Heard calls St\u00f8rmer \"the acknowledged authority\" on aurorae.[19] Heard writes, \"The Polar Aurora will undoubtedly remain for many years a standard reference book; it belongs on the desk of anyone whose work or interest is involved with aurorae.\"[19]\n Other astrophysical phenomena investigated by St\u00f8rmer include pulsations of the earth's magnetic field, echoing in radio transmissions, nacreous clouds and luminous night clouds, zodiacal light, meteor trails, the solar corona and solar vortices, and cosmic rays.[1]\n St\u00f8rmer was a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS)[1] and a Corresponding Member of the French Academy of Sciences.[1] He was also a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1900.[2] He was given honorary degrees by Oxford University (in 1947), the University of Copenhagen (1951), and the Sorbonne (1953), and in 1922 the French Academy awarded him their Janssen Medal.[1][4][2] Three times St\u00f8rmer was a plenary speaker in the International Congress of Mathematicians (1908 in Rome, 1924 in Toronto, and 1936 in Oslo);[20] he was an invited speaker of the ICM in 1920 in Strasbourg[21] and in 1932 in Zurich.[20] In 1971, the crater St\u00f6rmer on the far side of the Moon was named after him.[22]\n In 1902, St\u00f8rmer was decorated with King Oscar II's Medal of Merit in gold. He was also decorated as a Knight, First Order of the Order of St. Olav in 1939. He was upgraded to Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav in 1954.[2]\n \n ", "tags": ["1874 births", "1957 deaths", "People from Skien", "University of Oslo alumni", "University of Paris alumni", "University of Oslo faculty", "Norwegian astronomers", "Norwegian mathematicians", "Norwegian physicists", "Number theorists", "20th-century astronomers", "Members of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "CS1 Norwegian-language sources (no)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Good articles", "Articles with hCards", "Articles needing IPA", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Botanist identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Use dmy dates from May 2018"], "raw": "\"St\u00f8rmer\" redirects here.
