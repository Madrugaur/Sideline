He got his name from his master (Abu\u2018l Husayn \u2018Al\u012b ibn Muhammad al-Kh\u0101zin al-Marwaz\u012b) who was the treasurer of Marv.[5]:107 The term kh\u0101zin was simply the title of the royal treasurer since the early Islamic period.[9] His master made provisions so that al-Khazini could obtain a first-class education.[5] Some believe that al-Khazini was a pupil of Omar Khayyam.[8] While this is not known, he wrote about Khayyam, in particular, he gave a description of the water-balance invented by him (and improved upon by Al-Isfizari).[6]:176 And according to some sources, he collaborated with him on the reformation of the Persian calendar in 1079.[10]:199\n Al-Khazini was known for being a humble man. He refused thousands of Dinar for his works, saying he did not need much to live on because it was only his cat and himself in his household.[7] Al-Khazini was one of only about twenty astronomers of the Islamic era who performed original observations.[7] His works reached Byzantium in the 14th century, in particular, they were studied by George Chrysococces and later by Theodore Meliteniotes.[5]:107\n Al Khazini seems to have been a high government official under Sanjar ibn Malikshah and the sultan of the Seljuk Empire.
