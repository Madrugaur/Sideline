{"name": "Uriel Frisch", "content": "Uriel Frisch (born in Agen, in France, on December 10, 1940)[1] is a French mathematical physicist known for his work on fluid dynamics and turbulence.\n From 1959 to 1963 Frisch was a student at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. Early in his graduate studies, he became interested in turbulence, under the mentorship of Robert Kraichnan, a former assistant to Albert Einstein.[2] Frisch earned a Ph.D. in 1967 from the University of Paris, and since then he has worked at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). He retired in 2006, and became a director of research emeritus at CNRS.[1][3]\n Frisch's wife H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is also a physicist, and the granddaughter of mathematician Paul L\u00e9vy.[4]\n Frisch is the author of a 1995 book on turbulence[5] and of over 200 research publications.\n One of his most cited works, published in 1986, concerns the lattice gas automaton method of simulating fluid dynamics using a cellular automaton. The method used until that time, the HPP model, simulated particles moving in axis-parallel directions in a square lattice, but this model was unsatisfactory because it obeyed unwanted and unphysical conservation laws (the conservation of momentum within each axis-parallel line).
