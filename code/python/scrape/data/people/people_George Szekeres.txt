He worked six years in Budapest as an analytical chemist. He married Esther Klein in 1936. Being Jewish, the family had to escape from the Nazi persecution so Szekeres took a job in Shanghai, China. There they lived through World War II, the Japanese occupation and the beginnings of the Communist revolution. Their son, Peter, was born in Shanghai.\n In 1948, he was offered a position at the University of Adelaide, Australia, that he gladly accepted. After all the troubles he had, he began flourishing as a mathematician. A few years later, his daughter Judy was born. In 1963, the family moved to Sydney, where Szekeres took a position at the University of New South Wales, and taught there until his retirement in 1975. He also devised problems for secondary school mathematical olympiads run by the university where he taught, and for a yearly undergraduate competition run by the Sydney University Mathematics Society.\n Szekeres worked closely with many prominent mathematicians throughout his life, including Paul Erd\u0151s, Esther Szekeres (n\u00e9e Esther Klein), P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n, B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s, Ronald Graham, Alf van der Poorten, Mikl\u00f3s Laczkovich, and John Coates.\n The so-called Happy Ending problem is an example of how mathematics pervaded George's life.

Erd\u0151s dubbed the original problem the \"Happy Ending\" problem because it resulted in George and Esther's marriage in 1937.\n George and Esther died within an hour of each other on 28 August 2005 in Adelaide, South Australia.[4]\n ", "tags": ["1911 births", "2005 deaths", "Australian Jews", "Australian mathematicians", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics alumni", "Combinatorialists", "Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science", "Hungarian Jews", "Hungarian mathematicians", "Members of the Order of Australia", "University of New South Wales faculty", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "EngvarB from August 2014", "Use dmy dates from August 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian-Australian mathematician\n\n\nGeorge SzekeresGeorge Szekeres, 2001Born(1911-05-29)29 May 1911Budapest, HungaryDied28 August 2005(2005-08-28) (aged\u00a094)Adelaide, AustraliaNationalityHungarian-AustralianAlma\u00a0materTechnical University of BudapestKnown\u00a0forSzekeres snarkKruskal\u2013Szekeres coordinatesErd\u0151s\u2013Szekeres theoremSpouse(s)Esther SzekeresAwardsThomas Ranken Lyle Medal (1968)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicianInstitutionsUniversity of AdelaideUniversity of New South WalesDoctoral studentsAlfred van der Poorten\n\nGeorge Szekeres AM FAA (Hungarian:\u00a0[\u02c8s\u025bk\u025br\u025b\u0283]; 29 May 1911 \u2013 28 August 2005) was a Hungarian\u2013Australian mathematician.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early years\n2 Career\n3 Honours\n4 Personal life\n5 See also\n6 Notes\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly years[edit]\nSzekeres was born in Budapest, Hungary, as Szekeres Gy\u00f6rgy and received his degree in chemistry at the Technical University of Budapest.

During 1933, George and several other students met frequently in Budapest to discuss mathematics. At one of these meetings, Esther Klein proposed the following problem:\n\nGiven five points in the plane in general position, prove that four of them form a convex quadrilateral.\nAfter allowing George, Paul Erd\u0151s, and the other students to scratch their heads for some time, Esther explained her proof.[3]  Subsequently, George and Paul wrote a paper (1935) that generalises this result; it is regarded as one of the foundational works in the field of combinatorial geometry.
