{"name": "Herbert A. Hauptman", "content": "\n Herbert Aaron Hauptman (February 14, 1917 \u2013 October 23, 2011)[2] was an American mathematician and Nobel laureate.[3] He pioneered and developed a mathematical method that has changed the whole field of chemistry and opened a new era in research in determination of molecular structures of crystallized materials. Today, Hauptman's direct methods, which he continued to improve and refine, are routinely used to solve complicated structures. It was the application of this mathematical method to a wide variety of chemical structures that led the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to name Hauptman and Jerome Karle recipients of the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n He was born in to a Jewish family in New York City, the oldest child of a Leah (Rosenfeld) and Israel Hauptman.[4] He was married to Edith Citrynell since November 10, 1940, with two daughters, Barbara (1947) and Carol (1950).\n He was interested in science and mathematics from an early age which he pursued[how?] at Townsend Harris High School, graduated from the City College of New York (1937) and obtained an M.A. degree in mathematics from Columbia University in 1939.\n After the war he started a collaboration with Jerome Karle at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. and at the same time enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University of Maryland, College Park. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Maryland in 1955 in physics, which is part of the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences.[5] This combination of mathematics and physical chemistry expertise enabled them to tackle head-on the phase problem of X-ray crystallography. His work on this problem was criticized because, at the time, the problem was believed unsolvable.[6]\nBy 1955 he had received his Ph.D. in mathematics, and they had laid the foundations of the direct methods in X-ray crystallography. Their 1953 monograph, \"Solution of the Phase Problem I. The Centrosymmetric Crystal\", contained the main ideas, the most important of which was the introduction of probabilistic methods through a development of the Sayre equation.\n In 1970 he joined the crystallographic group of the Medical Foundation of Buffalo of which he was Research Director in 1972. During the early years of this period he formulated the neighborhood principle and extension concept. These theories were further developed during the following decades.\n In 2003, as an atheist[7] and secular humanist, he was one of 22 Nobel laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.[8]\n Hauptman has authored over 170 publications, including journal articles, research papers, chapters and books. In 1970, Hauptman joined the crystallographic group of the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute (formerly the Medical Foundation of Buffalo) of which he became Research Director in 1972. Until his death, he served as President of the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute as well as Research Professor in the Department of Biophysical Sciences and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University at Buffalo. Prior to coming to Buffalo, he worked as a mathematician and supervisor in various departments at the Naval Research Laboratory from 1947. He received his B.S. from City College of New York, M.S. from Columbia University and Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, College Park.\n ", "tags": ["1917 births", "2011 deaths", "Nobel laureates in Chemistry", "American Nobel laureates", "Jewish Nobel laureates", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American people of German-Jewish descent", "Jewish American scientists", "Jewish atheists", "Jewish chemists", "American atheists", "Columbia University alumni", "American physical chemists", "University of Maryland, College Park alumni", "City College of New York alumni", "Townsend Harris High School alumni", "Secular humanists", "Mathematicians from New York (state)", "Use mdy dates from January 2021", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from January 2020", "Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nAmerican mathematician\nHerbert A.
