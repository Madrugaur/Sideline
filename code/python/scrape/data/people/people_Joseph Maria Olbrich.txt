He had two sisters, who died before he was born, and two younger brothers, John and Edmund. His father was a prosperous confectioner and wax manufacturer who also owned a brick works, where Olbrich's interest in the construction industry has its early origin.\n Olbrich studied architecture at the University of Applied Arts Vienna (Wiener Staatsgewerbeschule) and the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where he won several prizes. These included the Prix de Rome, for which he traveled in Italy and North Africa.[1]  In 1893, he started working for Otto Wagner, the Austrian architect, and probably did the detailed construction for most of Wagner's Wiener Stadtbahn (Metropolitan Railway) buildings.\n In 1897, Gustav Klimt, Olbrich, Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser founded the Vienna Secession artistic group. Olbrich designed their exhibition building, the famous Secession Hall, which became the movement's landmark.[2] In 1899, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, founded the Darmstadt Artists' Colony, for which Olbrich designed many houses (including his own) and several exhibition buildings. Olbrich gained Hessian citizenship in 1900 and was appointed to a professorship by the Grand Duke. In 1903, he married Claire Morawe.[3]\n In the following years, Olbrich executed diverse architectural commissions and experimented in applied arts and design. He designed pottery, furniture, book bindings, and musical instruments. His courtyard and interiors[4] at the St. Louis World's Fair won the highest prize at the exhibition.[5] At the time, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote of his pavilion, \"The interior decorators of the United States are now talking about the Olbrich Pavilion. It is already indicated as one of the things at the World's Fair which will leave a permanent mark upon American life.\"[6]  He was subsequently appointed corresponding member of the American Institute of Architects.[7] His architectural works, especially his exhibition buildings for the Vienna and Darmstadt Secessions, had a strong influence on the development of the Art Nouveau style.\n Shortly after his daughter Marianne's birth on 19 July 1908, Olbrich died from leukemia in D\u00fcsseldorf on 8 August, aged 40.\n Secession Hall, Vienna\n Olbrich's house at the Darmstadt Artists' Colony\n Upper Hesse Exhibition House, Darmstadt Artists' Colony\n Exhibition building\n Wilhelm Deiters\u2019 House\n Gl\u00fcckert House\n \"Prinzessinenschloss\" in Langen, Germany\n Wedding tower\n Ernst-Ludwig House\n Department store in Dusseldorf\n ", "tags": ["1867 births", "1908 deaths", "Austrian architects", "People from Austrian Silesia", "Academy of Fine Arts Vienna alumni", "Vienna Secession architects", "People from Opava", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NGV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Joseph Maria OlbrichBorn(1867-12-22)22 December 1867Opava, Austrian SilesiaDied8 August 1908(1908-08-08) (aged\u00a040)D\u00fcsseldorf,  German EmpireNationalityAustrianOccupationArchitectAwardsPrix de Rome (1893)BuildingsSecession hall\n\nJoseph Maria Olbrich (22 December 1867 \u2013 8 August 1908) was an Austrian architect and one of the Vienna Secession founders.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Works\n4 Gallery\n5 See also\n6 References\n\n6.1 Additional references\n\n\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nOlbrich was born in Opava, Austrian Silesia (today in the Czech Republic), the third child of Edmund and Aloisia Olbrich.
