{"name": "Giordano Vitale", "content": "Giordano Vitale or Vitale Giordano (October 15, 1633 \u2013 November 3, 1711) was an Italian mathematician. He is best known for his theorem on Saccheri quadrilaterals. He may also be referred to as Vitale Giordani, Vitale Giordano da Bitonto, and simply Giordano.\n Giordano was born in Bitonto, in southeastern Italy, probably on October 15, 1633. As an adolescent he left (or was forced to leave) his city and, after an adventurous youth (that included killing his brother-in-law for calling him lazy) he became a soldier in the Pontifical army. During these adventures he read his first book of mathematics, the Aritmetica prattica by Clavius. At twenty-eight, living in Rome, he decided to devote himself to mathematics. The most important book he studied was Euclid's Elements in the Italian translation by Commandino.\n In Rome he made acquaintance with the renowned mathematicians Giovanni Borelli and Michelangelo Ricci, who became his friends. He was employed for a year as a mathematician by ex-Queen Christina of Sweden during her final stay in Rome. In 1667, a year after its foundation by Louis XIV, he became a lecturer in mathematics at the French Academy in Rome, and in 1685 he gained the chair of mathematics at the prestigious Sapienza University of Rome. Friend of Vincenzo Viviani, Giordano met Leibniz in Rome when Leibniz stayed there during his journey through Italy in the years 1689\u201390.

This in turn is due to Clavius, whose proof of the assumption in his 1574 Commentary on Euclid is faulty.[1][2] So using a figure he found in Clavius, now called a Saccheri quadrilateral, Giordano tried to come up with his own proof of the assumption, in the course of which he proved:\n\nIf ABCD is a Saccheri quadrilateral (angles A and B right angles, sides AD and BC equal) and HK is any perpendicular from DC to AB, then\n(i) the angles at C and D are equal, and\n(ii) if in addition HK is equal to AD, then angles C and D are right angles, and DC is equidistant from AB.\nThe interesting bit is the second part (the first part had already been proved by Omar Khayy\u00e1m in the 11th century), which can be restated as:\n\nIf 3 points of a line CD are equidistant from a line AB then all points are equidistant.\nWhich is the first real advance in understanding the parallel postulate in 600 years.[3][4]\n\nPublications[edit]\nGiordano's published work includes:\n\nLexicon mathematicum astronomicum geometricum (1st edition 1668, Paris. 2nd edition with additions 1690, Rome)\nEuclide restituto, ovvero gli antichi elementi geometrici ristaurati e facilitati da Vitale Giordano da Bitonto.
