{"name": "Emil Grosswald", "content": "Emil Grosswald (December 15, 1912 \u2013 April 11, 1989) was a mathematician who worked primarily in number theory.\n Grosswald was born on December 15, 1912 in Bucharest, Romania. He received a Master's degree in both mathematics and electrical engineering from the University of Bucharest in 1933, spent 6 months in Italy and then received a Dipl\u00f4me from \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 in Paris.[1]\n Grosswald was Jewish. When war broke out, he fled from Paris in June, 1940 to the University of Montpellier, where he began doctoral studies in mathematics.  He fled at the end of 1941, through Spain and Lisbon to Cuba.  He moved to Puerto Rico in 1946 and then to the United States in 1948. He received his Ph.D. under Hans Rademacher from the University of Pennsylvania in 1950.[2] He was Visiting Professor at the University of Paris in 1964\u20131965 and one of his books, The Theory of Numbers, was written that year.\n He met his wife Elisabeth (Lissy) Rosenthal in Cuba, probably in 1941 or 1942. They were married in 1950 in Saskatoon, Canada, where he had his first teaching position after receiving his Ph.D. They spent two years at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey in 1951 and 1959. During their first stay, they met Albert Einstein, with whom Emil had a correspondence, later bequeathed to the University of Texas, and formed many friendships, among others with the physicist Freeman Dyson.\n Emil and Lissy had two daughters, Blanche, who became a professor of Social Work at Rutgers University but died in 2003 at the age of 50, and Vivian, a professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh. Vivian was decorated in 2007 by the Republic of Austria for her work as the United States appointee to the Austrian General Settlement Fund Committee for Nazi-era property compensation, and in 2013 by the government of France for her services in promotion of the French language and culture in the United States. Emil is the uncle of Pamela Ronald, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, whose father Robert Ronald (n\u00e9 Rosenthal) describes the family's escape from the Nazis in his memoir, \"Last Train to Freedom\". The son of Lissy\u2019s second cousin (Ernest Beutler) is 2011 Nobel Laureate Bruce Beutler. Emil was also the nephew of the French composer Marcel Mihalovici, who arrived in Paris in the 1920s with Georges Enesco.\n After Grosswald's death, the American Mathematical Society held a national meeting in his honor, and in 1991 a Festschrift was published in his honor: \"A Tribute to Emil Grosswald: Number Theory and Related Analysis.\" Of his attitude towards mathematics, one of the volume's editors noted the following: \"In Grosswald's world, mathematics is challenge demanding dedication and long hours of work; it is science combined with art, truth with beauty. It is passionate and eternal pursuit of excellence. It is humility in the face of a powerful and proud history. Above all, it is meaning, a reason to go on...\" Another colleague wrote: \"He seemed to know everything \u2013 indeed it seems to me he must always have known everything. He was supportive, enthusiastic, but also demanding ... The depth of his love for mathematics inspired us all to strive to do better.\"[citation needed]\n Grosswald died on April 11, 1989 in Narberth, Pennsylvania.[1]\n Grosswald's first three scientific papers, written while he was in Cuba, were published under the pseudonym E. G. Garnea.[3]:11  He published articles in English, German, French, Spanish and Italian.\n After receiving his PhD in 1950, Grosswald taught at the University of Pennsylvania until, towards the end of his life, he moved to Temple University to help build its graduate department in mathematics. He also held positions at the University of Saskatchewan (1950), Institute for Advanced Study (1951 and 1959), the Technion (1980\u20131981), Swarthmore College (1982), and the University of Paris (Institut Marie Curie).\n Grosswald completed some works of his teacher Hans Rademacher, who died in 1969. Rademacher had prepared notes for an Earle Raymond Hedrick Lecture in Boulder, Colorado in 1963 on Dedekind sums, but fell ill, and Grosswald gave the lecture for him.[4]\nAfter Rademacher's death, Grosswald edited and completed the notes and published them in the Carus Mathematical Monographs series as Dedekind Sums.[5]:214 He also edited for publication Rademacher's posthumous textbook Topics in Analytic Number Theory.[1] He published numerous other books and countless articles.\n Grosswald was elected to the Board of Governors of the Mathematical Association of America for 1965\u20131968.[6] Temple University's Mathematics Department annually sponsors the Emil Grosswald Memorial Lectures.[7]\n ", "tags": ["20th-century American mathematicians", "Mathematical analysts", "Number theorists", "Scientists from Bucharest", "Romanian Jews", "Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United States", "Temple University faculty", "University of Bucharest alumni", "University of Pennsylvania alumni", "University of Pennsylvania faculty", "1912 births", "1989 deaths", "Mathematicians from Pennsylvania", "Sup\u00e9lec alumni", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2021", "CS1: long volume value", "CS1 maint: extra text: authors list", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Mathematician\nEmil GrosswaldBorn(1912-12-15)December 15, 1912Bucharest, RomaniaDiedApril 11, 1989(1989-04-11) (aged\u00a076)Alma\u00a0materUniversity of BucharestUniversity of PennsylvaniaScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of PennsylvaniaTemple UniversityDoctoral advisorHans RademacherDoctoral studentsDavid BressoudJean-Marie De Koninck\n\nEmil Grosswald (December 15, 1912 \u2013 April 11, 1989) was a mathematician who worked primarily in number theory.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and education\n2 Career\n3 Selected publications\n4 Notes\n5 Further reading\n6 External links\n\n\nLife and education[edit]\n Emil Grosswald (right) and Fred van der Blij in 1968.\nGrosswald was born on December 15, 1912 in Bucharest, Romania.
