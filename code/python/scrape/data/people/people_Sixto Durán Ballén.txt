He served as Mayor of Quito between 1970 and 1978. In 1951, he co-founded a political party, the Social Christian Party.[3] In 1991, he left the Social Christian Party  formed a new  conservative group, the Republican Union Party (PUR), before running for president for the third time in 1992.[4]\n Dur\u00e1n-Ball\u00e9n was elected as President of Ecuador in 1992. He served as congressman in 1984 and again in 1998. he helped to modernize the Ecuadorian economy while facing challenges from the World Bank and oversaw and resolved the Cenepa War during the last years of his presidency.[5] He received positive ratings, upon leaving office four years later on August 10, 1996. His presidency was seen favorably by the public polls, but received mixed opinions from scholars.[6][7]\n Dur\u00e1n-Ball\u00e9n was born on July 14, 1921, in Boston, Massachusetts.[8] He was born while his parents, Sixto Dur\u00e1n-Ball\u00e9n Romero and Maria Eugenia Cordov\u00e9z y Cayzedo, were on a diplomatic mission in the United States.[9]\n Ball\u00e9n studied at San Jose La Salle  grammar schools  in Guayaquil and in Quito. His secondary schooling was with the Jesuits at San Gabriel high school. Dur\u00e1n-Ball\u00e9n studied architecture at Columbia University, where he graduated first in his class in 1945.[10][11]\n He married in New York Josefina Villalobos in 1945.[12]\n Dur\u00e1n-Ball\u00e9n was one of the founders of the Social Christian Party (PSC) together with Camilo Ponce Enr\u00edquez in 1955.[3] Under the presidency of Camilo Ponce Enr\u00edquez, he served as minister of public works from 1956 to 1960. Went on to Washington DC where was named Deputy Director of Projects Analysis, at the beginnings of the Inter-American Development Bank.[3]  Returning in 1968 to his private practice of Architecture, ran for Mayor and was elected Mayor of Quito in 1970 and re-elected in 1974.[13]\n In 1979 he ran as the PSC's presidential candidate, but was defeated by the populist Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera. In 1984, President Leon Febres-Cordero, appointed Dur\u00e1n-Ball\u00e9n Minister of Housing, position he held until 1988 when the Social Christian Party chose him to run again for President.   However \"his heart was not in it\" as his youngest daughter of his nine children was going through the rigors of bone marrow  transplant and chemotherapy because of Leukemia. She died in 1989 at age 29.  \n At the end of 1990 he publicly criticized the direction of the PSC in an public statement. In February 1991 he contested the internal elections for the party leadership, in which the Guayaquil faction (led by Febres-Cordero) succeeded in appointing Jaime Nebot as presidential candidate and national director. Dur\u00e1n-Ball\u00e9n alleged irregularities in the election of party delegates, to no avail (and despite opinion polls reportedly giving him advantage over Nebot).[14][6]\n As a consequence, Dur\u00e1n-Ball\u00e9n and his supporters left the party to form the more right-wing Republican Union Party. This decision was widely popular as it was seen as breaking with the political establishment, even being compared with Peru\u2019s Alberto Fujimori in the media.[15][16] They subsequently entered into a controversial alliance with the Conservative Party.[17] Eventually, Dur\u00e1n defeated Nebot in the second round of the 1992 presidential election.[18]\n Dur\u00e1n-Ball\u00e9n was inaugurated president on August 10, 1992.[1] At age 71, Ball\u00e9n was the oldest person to have served as president.[12]\nDuring his time as president, he actively pursued structural reform to modernize the Ecuadorian state and cut down wasteful bureaucratic spending.[19] During his presidency, Ball\u00e9n lowered the Ecuadorian inflation from 67% to 24%.[20] The result was a significant reduction of government deficits and a thriving private sector.[20] Dur\u00e1n-Ball\u00e9n also led Ecuador into membership in the WTO, with negotiations being led by his subsecretary of Foreign Affairs, Patricio Izurieta Mora-Bowen.[12] The admission to the WTO had a significant impact on the nation's political institutions and export competitiveness.[12]\n During his presidency, there was criticism towards Ball\u00e9n's economic policies.[21] Many analysts agree that all these actions carried out under his economic plan meant the prelude to almost absolute insolvency to which the country would arrive in 1998 with an external debt of 16.4 billion dollars.[20] He also faced harsh criticism when he eliminated the External Credit Committee in 1995 and was accused of abuse and subjection to public indebtedness.[22] In response to the corruption allegations against him, Ball\u00e9n called for a second popular referendum to allow reforms as per modernization of the state, which were largely rejected.[19]\n Ball\u00e9n faced challenges while attempting to secure the modernization of the Ecuadorian economy from the World Bank.[23] The World Bank insistent on the privatization of public services which resulted in the reduction of jobs, the elimination of alleged subsidies and the profitability of the Ecuadorian state management.[23]\n In 1995, Ball\u00e9n proved to be one of Ecuador's most successful war-time leaders when his determined leadership united a divided country under the theme Ni un paso atras which means \"not a single step backwards\" during the Cenepa War with Peru.[18] His last years as president, he focused on the resolution of the Cenepa War with President of Peru Alberto Fujimori.[24] The war ended with both nations withdrawing troops on December 28, 1995, a few months before Ball\u00e9n left office.[25]\n On August 10, 1996, Ball\u00e9n was succeeded by Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram. Upon leaving office, Ball\u00e9n was praised by the public opinion, while his economic policies and his involvement in the Cenepa War, caused his presidency to have mixed opinions from scholars.[6]\n Following his presidency, Ballen was elected deputy for the Pichincha Province in 1998. Between 2001 and 2003, he served as an ambassador to the Court of St. James in London.[26]\n In 2005, he wrote an autobiography titled A mi manera... Los a\u00f1os de Carondelet and edited by the publisher of the Universidad Andina Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. In 2006, he appeared as a candidate for the Andean Parliament for the Christian Democratic Union, but was not elected.[27]\n Ballen died in his sleep at his home in Northern Quito on the night of November 15, 2016, from natural causes at the age of 95.[28][29] He is survived by his wife Josefina and their eight children.[28]\n His state funeral was held on the following day on November 16 at Quito's city hall.[30] His funeral procession later conclude at a religious service at the Cathedral of Quito.[1] The incumbent president, Rafael Correa did not attend the funeral but he declared three days of national mourning.[31] Former president Gustavo Noboa and Ball\u00e9n's first vice president, Alberto Dahik, were also those in attendance.[32] His remains were later buried in a vault at the Church of Santa Teresita in Quito.[1]\n Ballen's term in office was also characterized by a continued political stalemate with a Congress led by his former party.[33] It spearheaded many of the corruption allegations against his administration and members of his family, accused of illicit enrichment, in cases such as \"Flores y Miel\" (\"Flowers and Honey\").[18] The impeachment of his Vice President Alberto Dahik, for allegedly using public funds illicitly, further weakened his stance. However none of these claims were properly supported and are suspected to have been started by his political adversaries to weaken his legacy.
