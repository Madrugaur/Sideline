Vu proved a central limit theorem on random points in convex bodies.[1]\nWith Zolt\u00e1n F\u00fcredi he gave an algorithm for mental poker.[1]\nWith F\u00fcredi he proved that no deterministic polynomial time algorithm determines the volume of convex bodies in dimension d within a multiplicative error dd.\nWith F\u00fcredi and J\u00e1nos Pach he proved the following six circle conjecture of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Fejes T\u00f3th: if in a planar circle packing each circle is tangent to at least 6 other circles, then either it is the hexagonal system of circles with identical radii, or there are circles with arbitrarily small radius.\nCareer[edit]\nB\u00e1r\u00e1ny received the Mathematical Prize (now Paul Erd\u0151s Prize) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1985.
