{"name": "Heinrich Schr\u00f6ter", "content": "Heinrich Eduard Schr\u00f6ter (8 January 1829 \u2013 3 January 1892) was a German mathematician, who studied geometry in the tradition of Jakob Steiner.\n Schr\u00f6ter went to (along with mathematicians Alfred Clebsch, Rudolf Lipschitz, Carl Gottfried Neumann) the Altst\u00e4dtisches Gymnasium in K\u00f6nigsberg, studying mathematics and physics. After graduating from the Gymnasium in 1845, he entered the University of K\u00f6nigsberg to continue the study of mathematics and physics under Jacobi school's Frederick Richelot (and Franz Ernst Neumann and Otto Hesse). After his volunteer year in the military, he went to the Berlin Friedrich-Wilhelms-University, where he was taught by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Jakob Steiner. In 1854 he received his doctorate in Richelot in K\u00f6nigsberg with a paper on elliptic functions. He then passed the state exam and was qualified as a teacher in 1855 at the University of Breslau (also on elliptic functions). In 1858 he became associate professor in Breslau and in 1861 professor. He died after he fell ill in 1891.\n Schr\u00f6ter was influenced by Steiner's lectures, which were available only as note sheets, on synthetic geometry (projective theory of conics) published in 1867. In Die Theorie der Oberfl\u00e4chen (the theory of surfaces) of 1880, one of his major works, he studied second order surfaces and third order space curves, continuing Steiner's work. For this work, he received the Steiner Prize of the Berlin Academy and became its corresponding member. He also investigated the third-order surfaces and fourth-order space curves.\n His students included Victor Eberhard, Moritz Pasch, Jakob Rosanes, and Rudolf Sturm.\n The original article was a translation (Google) of the corresponding article in German Wikipedia.\n ", "tags": ["1829 births", "1892 deaths", "19th-century German mathematicians", "People from K\u00f6nigsberg", "University of K\u00f6nigsberg alumni", "Humboldt University of Berlin alumni", "University of Breslau faculty", "People from the Province of Prussia", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from January 2020", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Heinrich Schr\u00f6terBorn8 January 1829K\u00f6nigsberg, PrussiaDied3 January 1892\u00a0(1892-01-04) (aged\u00a062)Breslau, PrussiaNationalityGermanScientific careerFieldsMathematicsDoctoral advisorFriedrich Julius RichelotDoctoral students\nVictor Eberhard\nMoritz Pasch\nJakob Rosanes\nRudolf Sturm\n\n\nHeinrich Eduard Schr\u00f6ter (8 January 1829 \u2013 3 January 1892) was a German mathematician, who studied geometry in the tradition of Jakob Steiner.\n\nLife and work[edit]\nSchr\u00f6ter went to (along with mathematicians Alfred Clebsch, Rudolf Lipschitz, Carl Gottfried Neumann) the Altst\u00e4dtisches Gymnasium in K\u00f6nigsberg, studying mathematics and physics.
