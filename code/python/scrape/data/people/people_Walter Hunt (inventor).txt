{"name": "Walter Hunt (inventor)", "content": "\n Walter Hunt (July 29, 1796 \u2013 June 8, 1859) was an American mechanic. He was born in Martinsburg, New York.[1] Through the course of his work he became renowned for being a prolific inventor, notably of the lockstitch sewing machine (1833), safety pin (1849),[2] a forerunner of the Winchester repeating rifle, a successful flax spinner, knife sharpener, streetcar bell, hard-coal-burning stove, artificial stone, street sweeping machinery, and the ice plough.[3]\n Walter Hunt did not realize the significance of many of these when he invented them; today, many are widely used products. He thought little of the safety pin, selling the patent for $400[4] to the company W R Grace and Company, to pay a man to whom he owed $15. He is said to have failed to patent his sewing machine at all because he feared it would create unemployment among seamstresses.  (This led to an 1854 court case when the machine was re-invented by Elias Howe; Hunt's machine shown to have design flaws limiting its practical use).[5]  In seeking patents for his inventions, Hunt used the services of Charles Grafton Page, a patent solicitor who had previously worked at the US Patent Office. Like Howe, Hunt is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.\n Some of his important inventions are shown here with drawings from the patent.\n Fountain pen  Patent 4927\n Safety pin  Patent 6281\n Nail making machine  Patent 3305\n Sewing machine  Patent 11,161\n Swivel-Cap Stopper  Patent 9,527\n Inkstand  Patent 4221\n Firing cock repeating gun  Patent 6663\n Ice Boat  Patent 958\n ", "tags": ["1796 births", "1859 deaths", "19th-century American inventors", "Burials at Green-Wood Cemetery", "People from Martinsburg, New York", "Use mdy dates from November 2016", "Articles lacking in-text citations from July 2012", "All articles lacking in-text citations", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThis article includes a list of general references, but it remains largely unverified because it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations.
