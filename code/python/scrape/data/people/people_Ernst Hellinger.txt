{"name": "Ernst Hellinger", "content": "Ernst David Hellinger (September 30, 1883 \u2013 March 28, 1950) was a German mathematician.\n Ernst Hellinger was born on September 30, 1883 in Striegau, Silesia, Germany (now Strzegom, Poland) to Emil and Julie Hellinger. He grew up in Breslau, attended school and  graduated from the Gymnasium there in 1902. When he was studying at the Gymnasium, he became fascinated with mathematics, due to excellent mathematics teachers at the school.\n After graduating from the Gymnasium, Ernst Hellinger entered the University of Heidelberg, but didn't complete his studies there. After Heidelberg, he studied at the University of Breslau, before completing his doctorate at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1907 with a thesis entitled Die Orthogonalinvarianten quadratischer Formen von unendlich vielen Variablen. At G\u00f6ttingen he worked with David Hilbert, one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century.\n Hellinger taught at the University of G\u00f6ttingen (1907\u20131909), the University of Marburg (1909\u20131914), and the University of Frankfurt (1914\u20131935).\n Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, and while they were in power the Nazis removed several Jewish scientists and mathematicians from German universities. Hellinger's family was Jewish, and he was removed from the faculty of the University of Frankfurt in 1936.\n On November 13, 1938, Hellinger was arrested, taken to the Festhalle, and then put into Dachau concentration camp. However, his friends were able to arrange a temporary job for Hellinger at Northwestern University at Evanston, Illinois in the United States. He was released from the Dachau camp after six weeks, on condition that he emigrate immediately.\n He joined the faculty at Northwestern University as lecturer in Mathematics in 1939. He became a U.S. citizen in 1944. Promoted to professor in 1945, he became emeritus in 1949. He died on March 28, 1950 in Chicago, Illinois, United States.\n Ernst Hellinger studied integral equations, the infinite system of equations, real functions and continued fractions.  A type of integral which he introduced in his dissertation became known as \"the Hellinger integral\", used for defining the Hellinger distance. Hellinger distance has been used to process natural language and learning word embeddings.[1] In addition, the Hilbert\u2013Hellinger theory of forms in infinitely many variables profoundly influenced mathematical analysis.\n ", "tags": ["1883 births", "1950 deaths", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty", "Northwestern University faculty", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Ernst HellingerCourtesy MFOBorn(1883-09-30)September 30, 1883Striegau, Silesia ProvinceDiedMarch 28, 1950(1950-03-28) (aged\u00a066)Chicago, Illinois, United StatesNationalityGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenKnown\u00a0forHellinger distanceScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsNorthwestern UniversityDoctoral advisorDavid Hilbert\n\nErnst David Hellinger (September 30, 1883 \u2013 March 28, 1950) was a German mathematician.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early years\n2 Academic career\n3 Later years\n4 Contributions to mathematics\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly years[edit]\nErnst Hellinger was born on September 30, 1883 in Striegau, Silesia, Germany (now Strzegom, Poland) to Emil and Julie Hellinger.
