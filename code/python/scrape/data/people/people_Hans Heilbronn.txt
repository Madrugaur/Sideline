{"name": "Hans Heilbronn", "content": "Hans Arnold Heilbronn FRS[1] (8 October 1908 \u2013 28 April 1975) was a mathematician.[2][3][4]\n He was born into a German-Jewish family. He was a student at the universities of Berlin, Freiburg and G\u00f6ttingen, where he met Edmund Landau, who supervised his doctorate. In his thesis, he improved a result of Hoheisel on the size of prime gaps.\n Heilbronn fled Germany for Britain in 1933 due to the rise of Nazism. He arrived in Cambridge, then found accommodation in Manchester and eventually was offered a position at Bristol University, where he stayed for about one and a half years.
