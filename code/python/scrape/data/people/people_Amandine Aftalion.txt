She is a director of research at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS).\n Aftalion studied at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (Paris) from 1992 to 1996, earning her agr\u00e9gation in mathematics in 1994 and Master of Advanced Studies in numerical analysis in 1995.[2] She defended her doctoral dissertation, Quelques probl\u00e8mes d'\u00e9quations aux d\u00e9riv\u00e9es partielles elliptiques non lin\u00e9aires et applications \u00e0 des mod\u00e8les en supraconductivit\u00e9 et en combustion, in 1997 at Pierre and Marie Curie University, under the direction of Henri Berestycki.[2][3] In 2002 she earned a habilitation with the thesis Equations aux d\u00e9riv\u00e9es partielles elliptiques non lin\u00e9aires\u00a0: propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qualitatives et mod\u00e8les en physique des basses temp\u00e9ratures.[2]\n She has been a researcher with CNRS since 1999, and was promoted to director of research in 2008.

The book studies quantum vortex and superfluid behavior in Bose\u2013Einstein condensates, using the Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation to model the energy in these systems.[4]\n In her research on the mathematics of sports, Aftalion uses differential equations to model both the motion and forces on a runner, and the aerobic and anaerobic fitness of the runner as a race progresses.[5]\nShe has used the theory of optimal control to show that long-distance runners can achieve greater endurance by small variations in speed, contradicting earlier research by Joseph Keller suggesting that runners should keep their speed nearly constant throughout a race.[6] In follow-on work, she showed that, although long-distance runners should speed up in the final sprint of a race, the optimal strategy for a short footrace involves slowing down towards the end of the race.[7]\n ", "tags": ["1973 births", "Living people", "French mathematicians", "Women mathematicians", "CNRS research directors", "Articles with short description", "Articles with short description added by PearBOT 5", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French applied mathematician\nAmandine Aftalion (born 1973)[1] is a French applied mathematician, known for her research on Bose\u2013Einstein condensates and on the mathematics of footracing.
