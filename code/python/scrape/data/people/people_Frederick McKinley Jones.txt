{"name": "Frederick McKinley Jones", "content": "\n Frederick McKinley Jones (May 17, 1893 \u2013 February 21, 1961) was an American inventor, entrepreneur, winner of the National Medal of Technology, and an inductee of the National Inventors Hall of Fame.[1] His innovations in refrigeration brought great improvement to the long-haul transportation of perishable goods.[2] He co-founded Thermo King.[1]\n Jones was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on May 17, 1893[2] to a White father and Black mother. His mother deserted him when he was a child. His father struggled to raise him on his own.[3] After he was virtually orphaned at the age of seven, he was raised by a priest at a Catholic rectory in Cincinnati.[4] Jones left school after 6th grade and left the rectory to return to Cincinnati at age 11, where he got a job first as a cleaning boy and by age 14 he was working as an automobile mechanic. He boosted his natural mechanical ability and inventive mind with independent reading and study and the willingness to seek new pastures in his search for advancement, against the odds.[4]\n In 1912, Jones moved to Hallock, Minnesota, where he worked as a mechanic on a 50,000-acre (200\u00a0km2) farm.[3]\n After service with the U.S. Army in World War I, Jones returned to Hallock; while employed as a mechanic, Jones taught himself electronics and built a transmitter for the town's new radio station. He also invented a device to combine sound with motion pictures. This attracted the attention of Joseph A. Numero of Minneapolis, Minnesota, who hired Jones in 1930 to improve the sound equipment made by his firm, Cinema Supplies Inc.\n Around 1938, Jones designed a portable air-cooling unit for trucks carrying perishable food,[4] and received a patent for it on July 12, 1940.[5] Numero sold his movie sound equipment business to RCA and formed a new company in partnership with Jones, the U.S. Thermo Control Company (later the Thermo King Corporation) which became a $3 million business by 1949. Portable cooling units designed by Jones were especially important during World War II, preserving blood, medicine, and food for use at army hospitals and on open battlefields.\n During his life, Jones was awarded 61 patents. Forty were for refrigeration equipment, while others went for portable X-ray machines, sound equipment, and gasoline engines.\n He died of lung cancer in Minneapolis in 1961.[4]\n ", "tags": ["National Medal of Technology recipients", "1893 births", "1961 deaths", "Deaths from lung cancer", "African-American businesspeople", "20th-century American businesspeople", "African-American inventors", "20th-century American inventors", "People from Hallock, Minnesota", "United States Army personnel of World War I", "Ingersoll Rand people", "Use mdy dates from February 2021", "Articles needing additional references from February 2020", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For others with the same or similar names, see Frederick Jones (disambiguation).\n\n\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
