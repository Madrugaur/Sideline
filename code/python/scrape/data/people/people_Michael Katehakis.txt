He is noted for his work in Markov decision process, Gittins index, the multi-armed bandit, Markov chains and other related fields.\n Katehakis was born and grew up in Heraklion Greece. He received his BS degree from the School of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Athens \u2013 Greece, an M.A. degree in Statistics from the University of South Florida, an M.S.. degree in Mathematical Methods in Engineering and Operations Research and a Ph.D. degree in Operations Research from Columbia University. His dissertation advisor at Columbia was Cyrus Derman. While a graduate student at Columbia Katehakis worked developing mathematical simulation programs for the \nTwo-rotor engine [1] and the Tri-rotor engine [2] projects under George Doundoulakis.\n After a member of technical staff position at Bell Laboratories, in 1981 he joined the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at SUNY Stony Brook. There he taught and he worked with Herbert Robbins on AFOSR sponsored research and as a consultant at the Brookhaven National Laboratory doing work on nuclear reactor reliability. Subsequently, he held a visiting position at the Department of Operations Research at Stanford University where he worked with Arthur F. Veinott Jr.  on computing the Gittins indices. Afterward, he joined the Decision Systems group at the Technical University of Crete.\n In 1989, he joined Rutgers University where he is currently a Distinguished Professor of Operations Research, and Chair of the department of Management Science and Information Systems. At Rutgers, he worked with Herbert Robbins again on sequential allocation problems; work that was supported by the NSF.  In addition, professor Katehakis has taught at Columbia University, at the University of Athens and at the University of Crete. Dr. Katehakis has been the Ph.D. thesis advisor for over 13 students.[1]\n Prof. Katehakis has consulted with various companies in the areas of high technology and he was the vice president of the Neotronics inc. a research company, where he worked with George Doundoulakis on projects funded by the private sector and the US army. He has served on the editorial boards of the \"Annals of Operations Research\", \"Mathematics of Operations Research\", the  \"Naval Research Logistics\", \"Operations Research Letters\", and the \"Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences\".\n In 2012, Katehakis was elected a Fellow of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS).\n In 2012, Katehakis was elected a Elected Member of the International Statistical Institute (ISI).\n In 1992, Katehakis was awarded the Wolfowitz Prize for \u201cintroducing dynamic allocation in survey sampling for the first time\u201d.\n ", "tags": ["1952 births", "Living people", "Rutgers University faculty", "Scientists from Heraklion", "Greek mathematicians", "American statisticians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century mathematicians", "Columbia University alumni", "Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Greek-language text", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Greek American mathematician\nMichael N.
