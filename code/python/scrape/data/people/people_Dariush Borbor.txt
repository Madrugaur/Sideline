In 1976, he set up Sphere Iran, a consortium of four specialist consulting firms, and proposed a comprehensive National Environmental Master plan for Iran.[4] In 1992, he created the Research Institute and Library of Iranian Studies (RILIS) where he is the director.[5][6]\n Borbor is widely regarded as one of the avant-garde architects of the modern movement in Iran;[7][8] a pioneer of modern urban planning,[9][10] named by some as \"father of modern urban planning\",[11][12][13][14] and a key figure in the promotion and creation of the High Urban Planning Council (1966, Persian: \u0634\u0648\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0639\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc\u200e).[15][16] He was described by Swiss architectural critic Anthony Krafft as \"one of the most innovative architects who is perhaps on the way of creating a Persian architectural style of the 20th century\";[8] and French architectural critic Michel Ragon defined him as \"the architect in search of a modern Iranian architectural style\".[7] He has won many competitions and received several international prizes and awards, including the Gold Mercury International from Italy,[17] 50 Outstanding Architects of the World from the Second Belgrade Triennial of World Architecture,[18] and the Pahlavi Royal Award.[19]\n Dariush Borbor was born in April 1934.
