{"name": "Zheng Ji (biochemist)", "content": "\n Zheng Ji (Chinese: \u90d1\u96c6) (6 May 1900 \u2013 29 July 2010) was a Chinese nutritionist and a pioneering biochemist.

In 1930 he went to America to study, majoring in biochemistry at Ohio State.  He also attended Yale and Indiana University, and in 1936 he obtained his PhD.\n Upon returning to China he successively served as a research fellow at the Scientific Research Institute of China; as a professor at the Central Medical School; as both a biochemistry professor and department head, simultaneously, at the Eastern China Military Medical School; as a professor at the Number 4 Military Medical College; and as both a biology professor and the head of the biochemistry teaching and research department at the Nanjing Medical School.\n In 1945, at the Central Medical School, he established a biochemistry research institute to train graduate students.  This was the first formal organization in China to teach biochemistry to graduate students, training a large number of students who went on to work in a variety of fields.
