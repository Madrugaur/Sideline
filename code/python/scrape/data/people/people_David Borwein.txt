{"name": "David Borwein", "content": "David Borwein (born March 24, 1924, in Kaunas, Lithuania) is a Canadian mathematician known for his research in the summability theory of series and integrals.  He has also done work in measure theory and probability theory, number theory, and approximate subgradients and coderivatives.  He has recently collaborated with his son, Jonathan Borwein, and with B.A. Mares Jr. on the properties of single-variable and many-variable sinc integrals.[1]\n Borwein was born in 1924 in Lithuania to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. He formerly resided and worked in St. Andrews, Scotland, before moving to London, Ontario where he eventually became Head of Mathematics at the University of Western Ontario.  He was also the president of the Canadian Mathematical Society (CMS).  The David Borwein Distinguished Career Award given out by the CMS is named after him.  He is currently an active researcher in summability theory, classical analysis, inequalities, matrix transformations, and is professor emeritus at the University of Western Ontario, department of Mathematics.\n His wife of over 60 years, Bessie Borwein, is a prominent anatomist, and is professor emerita of anatomy at the University of Western Ontario.\n In 2018 the Canadian Mathematical Society listed him in their inaugural class of fellows.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1924 births", "Canadian mathematicians", "Living people", "Lithuanian emigrants to Canada", "Lithuanian Jews", "Jewish Canadian scientists", "University of Western Ontario faculty", "Scientists from Kaunas", "Fellows of the Canadian Mathematical Society", "Presidents of the Canadian Mathematical Society", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Canadian mathematician\nDavid Borwein (born March 24, 1924, in Kaunas, Lithuania) is a Canadian mathematician known for his research in the summability theory of series and integrals.
