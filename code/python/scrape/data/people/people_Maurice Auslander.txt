{"name": "Maurice Auslander", "content": "Maurice Auslander (August 3, 1926 \u2013 November 18, 1994) was an American mathematician[1] who worked on commutative algebra and homological algebra. He proved the Auslander\u2013Buchsbaum theorem that regular local rings are factorial, the Auslander\u2013Buchsbaum formula,  and introduced Auslander\u2013Reiten theory and Auslander algebras.\n Born in Brooklyn, New York, Auslander received his bachelor's degree and his Ph.D. (1954) from Columbia University.
