{"name": "Glenn Murcutt", "content": "\n \n Glenn Marcus Murcutt AO (born 25 July 1936) is an Australian architect and winner of the 1992 Alvar Aalto Medal, the 2002 Pritzker Architecture Prize and the 2009 American Institute of Architects Gold Medal.  Glenn Murcutt works as a sole practitioner without staff, builds only within Australia and is known to be very selective with his projects. Being the only Australian winner of the prestigious Pritzker Prize, he is often referred to as Australia's most famous architect.[1]\n Murcutt was born in London to Australian parents. He spent the first five years of his life in the Morobe Province of Papua New Guinea, where he first encountered a simple, vernacular architecture. After moving to Sydney with his parents in 1941, he was educated at Manly Boys' High School and studied architecture at the Sydney Technical College, from which he graduated in 1961.[2] Murcutt's early work experience was with various architects, such as Neville Gruzman, Ken Woolley, Sydney Ancher and Bryce Mortlock, which exposed him to their style of organic architecture focussing on relationships to nature. By 1969, Murcutt established his own practice in the Sydney suburb of Mosman.[2][3]\n Murcutt works as a sole practitioner, producing residential and institutional work all over Australia. Although he does not work outside the country or run a large firm, his work has a worldwide influence, especially since Murcutt teaches master classes for beginning and established architects.[4]\n Murcutt's motto, 'touch the earth lightly', leads him to design his works to fit into the Australian landscape features. His works are highly economical and multi-functional. Murcutt also pays attention to aspects of the environment such as wind direction, water movement, temperature and light surrounding his sites before he designs the building itself. Materials such as glass, stone, timber, concrete, steel and corrugated iron are often included in his works.\n Testament to his influence internationally was the award of the 2002 Pritzker Architecture Prize, one of the highest distinctions in architecture.[5] In the words of the Pritzker jury: \"In an age obsessed with celebrity, the glitz of our 'starchitects', backed by large staffs and copious public relations support, dominates the headlines. As a total contrast, Murcutt works in a one-person office on the other side of the world ... yet has a waiting list of clients, so intent is he to give each project his personal best. He is an innovative architectural technician who is capable of turning his sensitivity to the environment and to locality into forthright, totally honest, non-showy works of art.\"  In 2009 Murcutt won the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal.\n Murcutt currently lectures and teaches architectural studies as a professor at the UNSW Faculty of Built Environment.\n His latest completed project is a new mosque in the Melbourne suburb of Newport.  In 2016, Murcutt\u2019s mosque project became the focus of a critically acclaimed documentary, \u201cGlenn Murcutt: Spirit of Place\u201d, by renowned filmmaker Catherine Hunter. The film documents the growing acceptance of Murcutt\u2019s strikingly contemporary design, weaving into the narrative the stories of his famous domestic commissions, interviews with those involved, and an intimate biography of his life.[6][7]  Hunter has said about Murcutt: \"He gives everything, he can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019s unstoppable, he\u2019s this force. Long before we started talking about things such as sustainability, Glenn was practicing those things.\"[8]\n Glenn Murcutt is currently designing a new permanent sound installation space, the Cobar Sound Chapel in Cobar NSW, together with composer Georges Lentz. It is due to be built in 2019-2020.\n Murcutt's son Nicholas (1964-2011) was also a practicing architect.\n Prestigious awards include:\n He is an Honorary Fellow of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), an International Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, an Honorary Fellow of the Finnish Association of Architects as well as Honorary Member of the Architects Institutes in Taiwan, Scotland and Singapore. In 2008 he was elected an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2010, he was named a Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council.[11] He was founding President of the Australian Architecture Association and is Chair of the Architecture Foundation Australia (annual Murcutt International Master Class).[4]\n ", "tags": ["1936 births", "Living people", "New South Wales architects", "Pritzker Architecture Prize winners", "People from Sydney", "University of New South Wales alumni", "Officers of the Order of Australia", "People educated at Manly Selective Campus", "Recipients of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects\u2019 Gold Medal", "Architecture educators", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with dead external links from July 2016", "Use Australian English from June 2020", "All Wikipedia articles written in Australian English", "Use dmy dates from May 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Commons link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DAAO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "\n\n\nGlenn MurcuttGlenn Murcutt in 2004Born (1936-07-25) 25 July 1936 (age\u00a084)London, EnglandNationalityAustralianOccupationArchitectAwardsRAIA Gold Medal (1992)Alvar Aalto Medal (1992)Pritzker Architecture Prize (2002)American Institute of Architects Gold Medal (2009)BuildingsMarie Short House (1975), Fredericks House (1982), Ball-Eastaway House (1983), Magney House (1984), Marika-Alderton House (1994), Arthur and Yvonne Boyd Education Centre (1999)\n\nGlenn Marcus Murcutt AO (born 25 July 1936) is an Australian architect and winner of the 1992 Alvar Aalto Medal, the 2002 Pritzker Architecture Prize and the 2009 American Institute of Architects Gold Medal.
