{"name": "Pranab Mukherjee", "content": "\n Pranab Kumar Mukherjee (Bengali pronunciation:\u00a0[pr\u0254n\u0254b ku\u02d0ma\u02d0r muk\u02b0ard\u0292i\u032f] (listen); 11 December 1935\u00a0\u2013 31 August 2020)[3][4][5][6][7][8] was an Indian politician who served as the 13th President of India from 2012 until 2017. In a political career spanning five decades, Mukherjee was a senior leader in the Indian National Congress and occupied several ministerial portfolios in the Government of India.[9] Prior to his election as President, Mukherjee was Union Finance Minister from 2009 to 2012. He was awarded India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 2019, by the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind.[10]\n Mukherjee got his break in politics in 1969 when the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi helped him get elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament of India, on a Congress ticket.[11] Following a meteoric rise, he became one of Gandhi's most trusted lieutenants and a minister in her cabinet in 1973. Mukherjee's service in a number of ministerial capacities culminated in his first stint as Finance Minister of India in 1982\u201384. He was also the Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha from 1980 to 1985.[12]\n Mukherjee was sidelined from Congress during the premiership of Rajiv Gandhi. Mukherjee had viewed himself and not the inexperienced Rajiv, as the rightful successor to Indira following her assassination in 1984. Mukherjee lost out in the ensuing power struggle. He formed his own party, the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress, which merged with Congress in 1989 after reaching a consensus with Rajiv Gandhi.[13] After Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991, Mukherjee's political career was revived when Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao appointed him Planning Commission head in 1991 and foreign minister in 1995. Following this, as elder statesman of Congress, Mukherjee was the principal architect of Sonia Gandhi's ascent to the party's presidency in 1998.[14]\n When the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) came to power in 2004, Mukherjee won a Lok Sabha (the popularly elected lower house of Parliament) seat for the first time. From then until his resignation in 2012, he held a number of key cabinet portfolios in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government\u00a0\u2013 Defence (2004\u201306), External Affairs (2006\u201309), and Finance (2009\u201312)\u00a0\u2013 apart from heading several Groups of Ministers (GoMs) and being Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha.[15] After securing the UPA's nomination for the country's presidency in July 2012, Mukherjee comfortably defeated P. A. Sangma in the race to the Rashtrapati Bhavan (the Indian presidential residence), winning 70 percent of the electoral-college vote.[16]\n In 2017, Mukherjee decided not to run for re-election and to retire from politics after leaving the presidency due to \"health complications relating to old age.\" His term expired on 25 July 2017.[17][18][19] He was succeeded as President by Ram Nath Kovind. In June 2018, Mukherjee became the first former President of India to address a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) event.[20]\n Pranab Mukherjee was born into a Bengali Brahmin family in Mirati, a village in the Bengal Presidency of British India (now in Birbhum district, West Bengal).[21] His father, Kamada Kinkar Mukherjee, was active in the Indian independence movement and was a member of the West Bengal Legislative Council between 1952 and 1964 as a representative of the Indian National Congress; he was also a member of AICC. His mother was Rajlakshmi Mukherjee.[22][23][14] He had two siblings: older sister Annapurna Banarjee (1928\u20132020) and older brother Piyush Mukherjee (1931\u20132017).[24]\n Mukherjee attended Suri Vidyasagar College in Suri (Birbhum), which was then affiliated to the University of Calcutta.[25] He subsequently earned an MA degree in political science and history and an LL.B. degree, both from the University of Calcutta[23]\n He was an upper-division clerk in the Office of the Deputy Accountant-General (Post and Telegraph) in Calcutta. In 1963, he became a lecturer (Assistant Professor) of Political Science at Vidyanagar College, Kolkata, affiliated to the University of Calcutta[26][27] and he also worked as a journalist at Desher Dak (Call of the Motherland) before entering politics.[28] Mukherjee first ran for public office in 1969, when he won a seat in the Rajya Sabha (upper house) of the Indian parliament as a member of the Bangla Congress, which soon merged with the Congress Party. He served an additional four terms, although he left that chamber in 2004 and contested and won a seat in the Lok Sabha (lower house). He served there until mid-2012, when he ran for president of India.[29]\n Mukherjee started his political career in 1967 as a founding member of the Bangla Congress.[30] Ahead of the 1967 election, he played a crucial role in forging the United Front alliance against the Indian National Congress.[30] In 1969, he managed the successful Midnapore by-election campaign of an independent candidate, V. K. Krishna Menon. He became a member of the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of Indian parliament) in July 1969 on a Bangla Congress ticket.[30] Mukherjee soon became the medium of exchanging confidential notes between Indira Gandhi and Ajoy Mukherjee.[31] In 1972, Indira Gandhi recruited him to the Indian National Congress along with merging the Bangla Congress into the party.[32] Mukherjee was re-elected to the house in 1975, 1981, 1993, and 1999.[25]\n He became a Gandhi loyalist and was often described as her \"man for all seasons.\"[33] Mukherjee's rise was rapid in the early phase of his career and he was appointed Union Deputy Minister of Industrial Development in Indira Gandhi's cabinet in 1973. He was active in the Indian cabinet during the controversial Internal Emergency of 1975\u201377. Ruling Congress politicians of the day including Mukherjee were accused of using extra-constitutional powers to \"wreck established norms and rules of governance\". Following Congress's defeat in the 1977 general elections, the newly formed Janata government-appointed Shah Commission indicted Mukherjee; however, the commission was itself indicted in 1979 for stepping \"outside its jurisdiction\". Mukherjee emerged unscathed and rose through a series of cabinet posts to become Finance Minister from 1982 to 1984.[34][35]\n His term was noted for his work in improving the finances of the government, which enabled Gandhi to score a political point by returning the last instalment of India's first IMF loan.[36] As Finance Minister, Mukherjee signed the letter appointing Manmohan Singh as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India.[32]\n In 1979, Mukherjee became Deputy Leader of the INC in the Rajya Sabha, and in 1980, he was appointed Leader of the House.[25] He was considered the top-ranking Indian cabinet minister and he presided over cabinet meetings in the absence of the Prime Minister.[37]\n Mukherjee was sidelined from the INC following the assassination of Indira Gandhi. Although he was much more experienced in politics than Indira's son, Rajiv Gandhi, it was Rajiv who gained control. Mukherjee lost his position in the cabinet and was sent to manage the regional West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee. He was considered to be Indira's likely successor and, siding with those within his party who aligned themselves against Rajiv Gandhi, Mukherjee was sidelined and eventually expelled from the mainstream.[33][38]\n In 1986, Mukherjee founded another party, the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress (RSC), in West Bengal. The RSC and INC merged three years later after a compromise was reached with Rajiv Gandhi. The RSC had fared terribly in the 1987 Assembly polls in West Bengal. Many analysts, over the years, have attributed the muting of Mukherjee's political aspirations as the supreme leader to his inability to emerge as a magnetic mass leader.[33] On later being asked whether he ever desired to become Prime Minister, Mukherjee replied, \"7 RCR was never my destination.\"[39] Zee News noted: \"The statement assumes heft in the light of the longstanding speculation that Mukherjee, as one of the doyens of Congress, always nursed an ambition to occupy the top executive post\".[39]\n Mukherjee's political career revived following the Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, when P. V. Narasimha Rao chose to appoint him as deputy chairman of the Indian Planning Commission and subsequently as a union cabinet minister. He served as External Affairs Minister for the first time from 1995 to 1996 in Rao's cabinet.[25]\n Mukherjee was considered to be a Gandhi family loyalist and the principal architect of Sonia Gandhi's entry into politics, a mentoring responsibility he was believed to have continued shouldering.[33] He was made General Secretary of the AICC in 1998\u201399 after Sonia Gandhi became Congress President. Mukherjee was made President of the West Bengal Congress in 2000 and held the position until his resignation in 2010. He had earlier held the position in 1985.[23]\n Mukherjee became Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha in 2004.[25] He contested and won a Lok Sabha seat from Jangipur in West Bengal, which he would later retain in 2009. It was speculated in 2004 that Mukherjee would be made Prime Minister of India after Sonia Gandhi declined to become Prime Minister; however, Manmohan Singh was chosen instead.[40]\n Mukherjee was briefly considered for the post of the largely ceremonial Indian presidency in 2007, but his name was subsequently dropped after his contribution in the Union Cabinet was considered practically indispensable.[38]\n He held many important posts in the Manmohan Singh government: He had the distinction of being the minister for various high-profile ministries, including Defence, Finance, and External Affairs. Apart from being Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha and Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee President,[25] he also headed the Congress Parliamentary Party and the Congress Legislative Party, which consist of all the Congress MP's and MLA's in the country.\n Mukherjee ended his affiliation with the Indian National Congress and retired from active political life following his election as president in 2012. The Economic Times had noted: \"[the] decades of activity in critical all-rounder roles make [Mukherjee's] exit both a structural and generation shift. With him, the last of the Congress triumvirate\u00a0\u2013 along with Rao and R. Venkataraman\u00a0\u2013 who formed the core team of Indira/Rajiv regimes bows out. While Rao became PM, Pranab's political marathon too ends where Venkataraman's did, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan\".[41]\n Mukherjee was \"very well respected within the party social circles\".[42] Media accounts describe him as having \"a reputation as a number-crunching politician with a phenomenal memory and an unerring survival instinct\".[43]\n He became a member of the Congress Working Committee on 27 January 1978. He also became a member of the Central Parliamentary Board of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) that year. Mukherjee briefly held the position of treasurer of the AICC and the Congress party in 1978.[23]\n He was appointed chairman of the Campaign Committee of the AICC for conducting National Elections to Parliament in 1984, 1991, 1996, and 1998. He was chairman of the Central Election Coordination Committee of the AICC from 28 June 1999 to 2012. He was appointed to the Central Election Committee on 12 December 2001. Mukherjee was appointed General Secretary of the AICC in 1998.[23] In 1997, he was voted Outstanding Parliamentarian by the Indian Parliamentary Group.[44]\n After Sonia Gandhi reluctantly agreed to join politics, Mukherjee was one of her mentors, guiding her through difficult situations with examples of how her mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi, would have done things.[45] His talents were on display during the negotiations for the Patents Amendment Bill in early 2005. Congress was committed to passing an IP bill, but their allies in the United Progressive Alliance from the Left front had a long tradition of opposing some of the monopoly aspects of intellectual property. Mukherjee, as Defence Minister, was not formally involved but was roped in for his negotiation skills. He drew on many old allies including the CPI-M leader Jyoti Basu (former Chief Minister of West Bengal), and formed new intermediary positions, which included product patents. Then, he had to convince his own colleagues, including commerce minister Kamal Nath, who at one point said...\"An imperfect legislation is better than no legislation\".[46] Finally, on 23 March 2005, the bill was approved.[46]\n India Today wrote that Mukherjee's role in \"skillfully pushing through the historic 123 Agreement and treaty with the Nuclear Suppliers Group\" may have saved the UPA-II government from the 2008 motion of no confidence.[47]\n Mukherjee played a crucial role in steering the Cabinet pre-Lok Sabha elections when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh underwent a heart bypass surgery in 2008\u201309 by taking additional charges as chairman of the Cabinet Committee of Political Affairs and Union Minister in the Finance Ministry despite already being Union Minister of External Affairs.[48]\n Mukherjee's political skills and long experience in government have also led him to head a large number of committees of ministers in the government. At the time of his resignation, on being nominated as the UPA's presidential candidate, Mukherjee was heading several Groups of Ministers (GoMs) and Empowered Groups of Ministers (EGoMs).[49][50]\n Manmohan Singh appointed Mukherjee as the Minister of Defence of India when the Congress Party once again came to power in 2004. Mukherjee held the post until 2006. He expanded co-operation with the United States during his tenure. The Times of India reported on the Wikileaks cables release and noted how the U.S. was full of praise for the \"uniformed leadership\" of Indian armed forces. Mukherjee in June 2005 had inked the ten-year Indo-US Defence Framework deal.[51]\n Despite increasing co-operation with the United States, Mukherjee maintained that Russia would remain India's 'topmost' defence partner. He asserted that \"Russia has been and will remain India's largest defence partner in the years to come\" while inaugurating the 5th session of the Indo-Russian Inter-Governmental Commission on Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-MTC) in Moscow in 2005.[52]\n Russia and India held their first joint anti-terror war games in Rajasthan in October 2005, during which Mukherjee and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov narrowly escaped injury after a heavy mortar landed several metres from their platform.[53] The Russian ministry subsequently declared its hopes to follow up joint military exercises in India with further joint exercises on Russian territory.[53]\n Mukherjee was appointed External Affairs Minister of India in 1995. Under his leadership, India was made \"Full Dialogue Partner\" of ASEAN as part of the Look East foreign policy initiated by Narasimha Rao. Mukherjee left the position in 1996.[54][55]\n His second term began in 2006. He oversaw the successful signing of the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement with the U.S. government and then with the Nuclear Suppliers Group, allowing India to participate in civilian nuclear trade in spite of not having signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Mukherjee played a crucial role in mobilising world opinion against Pakistan after the 2008 Mumbai attacks. He left the position a year later to take over the Finance Ministry of India.[28]\n When asked what legacy he wanted to leave behind as Foreign Minister of India, Mukherjee replied, \"As the [man] who prepared Indian diplomacy to address the challenges of a more globalised, interdependent and uncertain world\".[47]\n Mukherjee thrice served as Commerce Minister of India. His first stints were in the Indira Gandhi government from 1980 to 1982 and again in 1984.[25] His third stint in the 1990s saw him contribute significantly to the negotiations which led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization.[28]\n Mukherjee's first stint as the Finance Minister of India was during the Indira Gandhi government in 1982. He presented his first annual budget in 1982\u201383. His first term was noted for the work he did to improve the finances of the government and for successfully returning the last instalment of India's first \nIMF loan.[36] Mukherjee signed the letter appointing Manmohan Singh as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India in 1982.[32] He was accused of patronage practices in the Ambani\u2013Wadia industrial feuds.[56]\n Mukherjee was credited with being an early reformer of the Indian economy. India Today wrote: \"Operation Forward, which [Mukherjee] and then Industries Minister Charanjit Chanana launched in the early 1980s, started the liberalisation process that flowered under Rao and Manmohan Singh\".[47] A Left-wing magazine once commented that \"socialism did not grow out of the pipe Mukherjee smoked\".[47]\n Mukherjee was removed from his position as Finance Minister by Rajiv Gandhi in 1984. Gandhi had wished to bring in his own team of staff to govern India.[41] Mukherjee was replaced even though he was rated as the best Finance Minister in the World that year according to a survey by Euromoney magazine.[36]\n He returned to handling the finances of India during the premiership of Narasimha Rao, after being appointed Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission.[57] During Mukherjee's tenure of 1991 to 1996, Dr. Manmohan Singh as Finance Minister oversaw many economic reforms to end the Licence Raj system and help open the Indian economy.[58]\n Mukherjee once again became the Finance Minister of India in 2009. He presented the annual budgets in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The 2010\u201311 budget included the country's first explicit target to cut public debt as a proportion of the GDP and Mukherjee targeted a budget deficit reduction of 4.1% of the GDP in the fiscal year 2012\u201313, from 6.5% in 2008\u201309.[59]\n He implemented many tax reforms, including scrapping the Fringe Benefits Tax and the Commodities Transaction Tax.[60] He implemented the Goods and Services Tax during his tenure.[61] These reforms were well received by major corporate executives and economists. The introduction of retrospective taxation, however, has been criticised by some economists.[62]\n Mukherjee expanded funding for several social sector schemes including the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. He also supported budget increases for improving literacy and health care. He expanded infrastructure programmes such as the National Highway Development Programme.[63] Electricity coverage was also expanded during his tenure. Mukherjee also reaffirmed his commitment to the principle of fiscal prudence as some economists expressed concern about the rising fiscal deficits during his tenure, the highest since 1991. Mukherjee declared the expansion in government spending was only temporary.[64]\n In 2010, he was awarded \"Finance Minister of the Year for Asia\" by Emerging Markets, the daily newspaper of record for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Mukherjee was praised for \"the confidence [he] has inspired in key stakeholders, by virtue of his fuel price reforms, fiscal transparency and inclusive growth strategies\".[65] The Banker also recognised him as \"Finance Minister of the Year.\"[59]\n Mukherjee's final years at the finance ministry were not considered a success. The NDTV, upon his resignation in June 2012, wrote: \"There [had] been a clamour from many quarters for a change in the Finance Ministry, with Mr Mukherjee having faced flak for several decisions where politics seemed to overwhelm economic imperatives\".[66]\n Mukherjee was chairman of the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata. He also held the following posts: chairman and president of the Rabindra Bharati University and the Nikhil Bharat Banga Sahitya Sammelan; trustee of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad and the Bidhan Memorial Trust. He also served on the Planning Board of the Asiatic Society.[25]\n Mukherjee was nominated as the presidential candidate of the United Progressive Alliance on 15 June 2012 after considerable political intrigue.[68][69] The elections were scheduled to be conducted on 19 July 2012 and the results were expected to be announced on 22 July 2012.  The nominee of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was P. A. Sangma.[70] To file his nomination for the presidential poll on 28 June, Mukherjee resigned from the government on 26 June 2012.[66]\n In the election, Mukherjee received 713,763 votes, while Sangma had 315,987.[71] In his victory speech, delivered outside his residence before the results were officially announced, he said:\n I would like to express my deep gratitude to all of you who are waiting. The figure has crossed 7\u00a0lakhs, only one state remains. The final figure will come from the returning officer. I would like to thank the people of India for electing me to this high office. The enthusiasm, the warmth of the people was remarkable. I have received much more from the people of this country, from the Parliament, than I have given. Now I have been entrusted with the responsibility of protecting and defending the constitution as President. I will try and justify the trust of the people. I would like to reciprocate the congratulation Shri Purno Sangma has extended.[72] Mukherjee was sworn in by the Chief Justice of India on 25 July 2012,[73] becoming the first Bengali to hold the post of President of India.[39] After being administered the oath of office, he stated that we are in the midst of a fourth world war of terror (the third was the Cold war) and what minutes of peace can achieve cannot be achieved in many years of war.[74]\n Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh both congratulated Mukherjee on his election as president.[75] Former Communist leader Somnath Chatterjee termed Mukherjee as one of \"the best parliamentarians and statesmen of India\" and said the country \"has got the most able man for the top job\".[76] Opposition leader Sharad Yadav declared \"the nation needed a president like Pranab Mukherjee\".[77] Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit commented and said Mukherjee will be \"one of the wisest presidents\". She further marvelled at the fact that parties in the opposition ranks supported Mukherjee. \"Even the NDA broke up and wanted to vote for the president to be Pranab Mukherjee\".[78] The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was reportedly \"shocked\" and \"upset\" at the cross-voting for Mukherjee by its legislative members.[79] However, BJP party president Nitin Gadkari congratulated Mukherjee and said \"I extend my hearty congratulations to Pranab Mukherjee on his election today as the new President of India\". Gadkari further declared \"I am sure that the country will make further development and progress. I wish him all success and a bright future\".[80]\n Zee News noted: \"What is striking about [Mukherjee] is that after more than four decades in public life, the Opposition had no ammunition against him after he was declared UPA\u2019s choice for President. In spite of Team Anna making some noise about him being involved in some corruption cases, it has been more or less an easy ride for Pranab to Raisina Hill. Once when Sonia Gandhi announced his name, most of the allies and the Opposition came on board. Whereas, NDA partner JD(U) saw no merit in opposing him, one of the bitter critics of the Congress Shiv Sena too toed the line a little too easily. This support was not for Congress but for [Mukherjee]\".[38]\n Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 was promulgated by Pranab Mukherjee on 3\u00a0February 2013, providing for the amendment of the Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on laws related to sexual offences.[81][82] As of July 2015, President Mukherjee had rejected 24 mercy pleas including those of Yakub Memon, Ajmal Kasab, and Afzal Guru.[83][84] Pranab Mukherjee becomes first President of India to reply all the mercy petitions in his term for the death row inmates and also replying the petitions of former Presidents.[85]\n In January 2017, Mukherjee announced that he would not contest the 2017 Presidential elections, citing \"advanced age and failing health\".[86]\n Pranab Mukherjee married Suvra Mukherjee on 13 July 1957. Suvra Mukherjee was born at Narail, Bengal Presidency, British India. She moved to Kolkata while she was 10 and married Pranab in 1957.[87] The couple had two sons and a daughter.[25] Suvra died on 18 August 2015, aged 74, of heart failure, while Mukherjee was still in office.[88] Their elder son, Abhijit Mukherjee, was a Congress MP from Jangipur, West Bengal, until 2019. He was elected in a by-election after his father vacated the seat. Before his election to the Lok Sabha, Abhijit was an MLA from Nalhati in Birbhum.[89]\n Mukherjee was inspired by Deng Xiaoping and quoted him quite frequently.[90] His hobbies were reading, gardening, and music.[25]\n His daughter Sharmistha Mukherjee is a Kathak dancer and politician of the Indian National Congress.[91]\n Mukherjee celebrated the Durga Puja at his ancestral home in Mirati village.[92] He used to make it a point to be at Mirati village every year to take part in the four-day rituals, the puja having a \"social dimension\" for him. \"I want to avail this opportunity to be with the people of my area\", Mukherjee said during a puja ceremony on 4\u00a0October 2011.[92]\n During the COVID-19 pandemic, on 10 August 2020, Mukherjee announced on Twitter that he had tested positive for COVID-19 prior to a surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain.[93] He was admitted to the hospital after accidentally slipping and falling in his bathroom.[94][95] He was on ventilator support and in critical condition at the Army's Research and Referral (R&R) hospital in Delhi.[96]\n On 13 August, the hospital reported that Mukherjee was in a deep coma after he underwent brain surgery; however, his vital parameters remained stable.[97][98] On 19 August, the R&R said that Mukherjee's health condition had declined as he had developed a lung infection.[99] On 25 August, his renal parameters became \"slightly deranged\", with the condition worsening days later.[100][101]\n Mukherjee died on 31 August 2020, aged 84, which was confirmed by his son Abhijit Mukherjee via Twitter.[102][103] His death came after the attending hospital confirmed that his health had deteriorated early that day, stating that he had been in septic shock since a day earlier, which was caused by his lung infection.[104][105]\n Condolences poured in immediately from leaders of both India and other nations. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the President Ramnath Kovind, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, Home Minister Amit Shah, and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi conveyed their condolences via Twitter.[106][107][108] The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin,[109] the President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani,[110] the President of the Maldives, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih,[111] the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina,[112] the Prime Minister of Bhutan, Lotay Tshering, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa, and the Prime Minister of Nepal, K. P. Sharma Oli, were among foreign leaders who paid their respects.[106][113][114] Sports players and actors from the country also voiced their sorrow.[115][116]\n The Government of India announced a seven-day period of state mourning between 31 August to 6 September, whereby the national flag would fly at half mast on all buildings wherever it is flown regularly.[117] The West Bengal state government declared a closure of state-run offices for the following day as a mark of respect.[118]\n The funeral was held the following day, on 1 September at the Lodhi Road crematorium, with full state honours.[119] The body was brought to the crematorium in a van instead of gun carriage due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in the country. His ashes were immersed into the Ganges river in Haridwar.[120][121][122]\n Pranab Mukherjee's positions in chronological order:[25][150][151]\n ", "tags": ["1935 births", "Indian political scientists", "20th-century Indian economists", "20th-century Indian historians", "21st-century Indian economists", "21st-century Indian historians", "14th Lok Sabha members", "15th Lok Sabha members", "Bengali Hindus", "Bengali people", "Bengali politicians", "Candidates for President of India", "Indian autobiographers", "Indian National Congress politicians from West Bengal", "Indian political party founders", "Indian political writers", "International Monetary Fund people", "Leaders of the Lok Sabha", "Lok Sabha members from West Bengal", "Members of the Planning Commission of India", "People from Birbhum district", "People from Kolkata", "Presidents of India", "Rajya Sabha members from West Bengal", "Recipients of the Padma Vibhushan in public affairs", "University of Calcutta alumni", "University of Calcutta faculty", "World Bank people", "Writers from West Bengal", "People from Murshidabad district", "20th-century Indian non-fiction writers", "21st-century Indian non-fiction writers", "Indian officials of the United Nations", "Recipients of the Bharat Ratna", "Ministers for External Affairs of India", "Defence Ministers of India", "Finance Ministers of India", "Ministers for Corporate Affairs", "Commerce and Industry Ministers of India", "2020 deaths", "State funerals in India", "Bangla Congress politicians", "Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in India", "CS1 maint: others", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list", "CS1 maint: extra text: authors list", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from January 2021", "Use Indian English from October 2019", "All Wikipedia articles written in Indian English", "Articles with hAudio microformats", "Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch", "Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata", "Articles with Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "13th President of the Republic of India (1935\u20132020)\n\n\nPranab MukherjeeOfficial Portrait, 201213th President of IndiaIn office25 July 2012\u00a0\u2013 25 July 2017Prime MinisterManmohan Singh  Narendra ModiVice PresidentMohammad Hamid AnsariPreceded byPratibha PatilSucceeded byRam Nath KovindMinister of FinanceIn office24 January 2009\u00a0\u2013 24 July 2012Prime MinisterManmohan SinghPreceded byManmohan Singh (Acting)Succeeded byManmohan Singh (Acting)In office5 January 1982\u00a0\u2013 31 December 1984Prime MinisterIndira GandhiPreceded byR.

In a political career spanning five decades, Mukherjee was a senior leader in the Indian National Congress and occupied several ministerial portfolios in the Government of India.[9] Prior to his election as President, Mukherjee was Union Finance Minister from 2009 to 2012. He was awarded India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 2019, by the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind.[10]\nMukherjee got his break in politics in 1969 when the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi helped him get elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament of India, on a Congress ticket.[11] Following a meteoric rise, he became one of Gandhi's most trusted lieutenants and a minister in her cabinet in 1973. Mukherjee's service in a number of ministerial capacities culminated in his first stint as Finance Minister of India in 1982\u201384. He was also the Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha from 1980 to 1985.[12]\nMukherjee was sidelined from Congress during the premiership of Rajiv Gandhi. Mukherjee had viewed himself and not the inexperienced Rajiv, as the rightful successor to Indira following her assassination in 1984. Mukherjee lost out in the ensuing power struggle. He formed his own party, the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress, which merged with Congress in 1989 after reaching a consensus with Rajiv Gandhi.[13] After Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991, Mukherjee's political career was revived when Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao appointed him Planning Commission head in 1991 and foreign minister in 1995. Following this, as elder statesman of Congress, Mukherjee was the principal architect of Sonia Gandhi's ascent to the party's presidency in 1998.[14]\nWhen the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) came to power in 2004, Mukherjee won a Lok Sabha (the popularly elected lower house of Parliament) seat for the first time. From then until his resignation in 2012, he held a number of key cabinet portfolios in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government\u00a0\u2013 Defence (2004\u201306), External Affairs (2006\u201309), and Finance (2009\u201312)\u00a0\u2013 apart from heading several Groups of Ministers (GoMs) and being Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha.[15] After securing the UPA's nomination for the country's presidency in July 2012, Mukherjee comfortably defeated P. A. Sangma in the race to the Rashtrapati Bhavan (the Indian presidential residence), winning 70 percent of the electoral-college vote.[16]\nIn 2017, Mukherjee decided not to run for re-election and to retire from politics after leaving the presidency due to \"health complications relating to old age.\" His term expired on 25 July 2017.[17][18][19] He was succeeded as President by Ram Nath Kovind. In June 2018, Mukherjee became the first former President of India to address a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) event.[20]\n\n Mukherjee with President of Nepal Bidhya Devi Bhandari\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Political career\n\n2.1 Political party role\n\n\n3 Union Cabinet Minister\n\n3.1 Minister of Defence\n3.2 Minister of External Affairs\n3.3 Minister of Commerce and Industry\n3.4 Minister of Finance\n3.5 Other positions\n\n\n4 President of India\n5 Personal life\n6 Illness and death\n7 Honours\n\n7.1 National honours\n7.2 Foreign honours\n7.3 Academic honours\n7.4 Other recognition\n\n\n8 Offices held\n9 Books written\n10 See also\n11 References\n12 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nPranab Mukherjee was born into a Bengali Brahmin family in Mirati, a village in the Bengal Presidency of British India (now in Birbhum district, West Bengal).[21] His father, Kamada Kinkar Mukherjee, was active in the Indian independence movement and was a member of the West Bengal Legislative Council between 1952 and 1964 as a representative of the Indian National Congress; he was also a member of AICC. His mother was Rajlakshmi Mukherjee.[22][23][14] He had two siblings: older sister Annapurna Banarjee (1928\u20132020) and older brother Piyush Mukherjee (1931\u20132017).[24]\nMukherjee attended Suri Vidyasagar College in Suri (Birbhum), which was then affiliated to the University of Calcutta.[25] He subsequently earned an MA degree in political science and history and an LL.B. degree, both from the University of Calcutta[23]\nHe was an upper-division clerk in the Office of the Deputy Accountant-General (Post and Telegraph) in Calcutta. In 1963, he became a lecturer (Assistant Professor) of Political Science at Vidyanagar College, Kolkata, affiliated to the University of Calcutta[26][27] and he also worked as a journalist at Desher Dak (Call of the Motherland) before entering politics.[28] Mukherjee first ran for public office in 1969, when he won a seat in the Rajya Sabha (upper house) of the Indian parliament as a member of the Bangla Congress, which soon merged with the Congress Party. He served an additional four terms, although he left that chamber in 2004 and contested and won a seat in the Lok Sabha (lower house). He served there until mid-2012, when he ran for president of India.[29]\n\nPolitical career[edit]\nMukherjee started his political career in 1967 as a founding member of the Bangla Congress.[30] Ahead of the 1967 election, he played a crucial role in forging the United Front alliance against the Indian National Congress.[30] In 1969, he managed the successful Midnapore by-election campaign of an independent candidate, V. K. Krishna Menon. He became a member of the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of Indian parliament) in July 1969 on a Bangla Congress ticket.[30] Mukherjee soon became the medium of exchanging confidential notes between Indira Gandhi and Ajoy Mukherjee.[31] In 1972, Indira Gandhi recruited him to the Indian National Congress along with merging the Bangla Congress into the party.[32] Mukherjee was re-elected to the house in 1975, 1981, 1993, and 1999.[25]\nHe became a Gandhi loyalist and was often described as her \"man for all seasons.\"[33] Mukherjee's rise was rapid in the early phase of his career and he was appointed Union Deputy Minister of Industrial Development in Indira Gandhi's cabinet in 1973. He was active in the Indian cabinet during the controversial Internal Emergency of 1975\u201377. Ruling Congress politicians of the day including Mukherjee were accused of using extra-constitutional powers to \"wreck established norms and rules of governance\". Following Congress's defeat in the 1977 general elections, the newly formed Janata government-appointed Shah Commission indicted Mukherjee; however, the commission was itself indicted in 1979 for stepping \"outside its jurisdiction\". Mukherjee emerged unscathed and rose through a series of cabinet posts to become Finance Minister from 1982 to 1984.[34][35]\nHis term was noted for his work in improving the finances of the government, which enabled Gandhi to score a political point by returning the last instalment of India's first IMF loan.[36] As Finance Minister, Mukherjee signed the letter appointing Manmohan Singh as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India.[32]\n\n Pranab Mukherjee addresses delegates of the 42nd Regional Conference of SIRC, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.\nIn 1979, Mukherjee became Deputy Leader of the INC in the Rajya Sabha, and in 1980, he was appointed Leader of the House.[25] He was considered the top-ranking Indian cabinet minister and he presided over cabinet meetings in the absence of the Prime Minister.[37]\nMukherjee was sidelined from the INC following the assassination of Indira Gandhi. Although he was much more experienced in politics than Indira's son, Rajiv Gandhi, it was Rajiv who gained control. Mukherjee lost his position in the cabinet and was sent to manage the regional West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee. He was considered to be Indira's likely successor and, siding with those within his party who aligned themselves against Rajiv Gandhi, Mukherjee was sidelined and eventually expelled from the mainstream.[33][38]\nIn 1986, Mukherjee founded another party, the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress (RSC), in West Bengal. The RSC and INC merged three years later after a compromise was reached with Rajiv Gandhi. The RSC had fared terribly in the 1987 Assembly polls in West Bengal. Many analysts, over the years, have attributed the muting of Mukherjee's political aspirations as the supreme leader to his inability to emerge as a magnetic mass leader.[33] On later being asked whether he ever desired to become Prime Minister, Mukherjee replied, \"7 RCR was never my destination.\"[39] Zee News noted: \"The statement assumes heft in the light of the longstanding speculation that Mukherjee, as one of the doyens of Congress, always nursed an ambition to occupy the top executive post\".[39]\nMukherjee's political career revived following the Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, when P. V. Narasimha Rao chose to appoint him as deputy chairman of the Indian Planning Commission and subsequently as a union cabinet minister. He served as External Affairs Minister for the first time from 1995 to 1996 in Rao's cabinet.[25]\nMukherjee was considered to be a Gandhi family loyalist and the principal architect of Sonia Gandhi's entry into politics, a mentoring responsibility he was believed to have continued shouldering.[33] He was made General Secretary of the AICC in 1998\u201399 after Sonia Gandhi became Congress President. Mukherjee was made President of the West Bengal Congress in 2000 and held the position until his resignation in 2010. He had earlier held the position in 1985.[23]\nMukherjee became Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha in 2004.[25] He contested and won a Lok Sabha seat from Jangipur in West Bengal, which he would later retain in 2009. It was speculated in 2004 that Mukherjee would be made Prime Minister of India after Sonia Gandhi declined to become Prime Minister; however, Manmohan Singh was chosen instead.[40]\nMukherjee was briefly considered for the post of the largely ceremonial Indian presidency in 2007, but his name was subsequently dropped after his contribution in the Union Cabinet was considered practically indispensable.[38]\nHe held many important posts in the Manmohan Singh government: He had the distinction of being the minister for various high-profile ministries, including Defence, Finance, and External Affairs. Apart from being Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha and Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee President,[25] he also headed the Congress Parliamentary Party and the Congress Legislative Party, which consist of all the Congress MP's and MLA's in the country.\nMukherjee ended his affiliation with the Indian National Congress and retired from active political life following his election as president in 2012. The Economic Times had noted: \"[the] decades of activity in critical all-rounder roles make [Mukherjee's] exit both a structural and generation shift. With him, the last of the Congress triumvirate\u00a0\u2013 along with Rao and R. Venkataraman\u00a0\u2013 who formed the core team of Indira/Rajiv regimes bows out. While Rao became PM, Pranab's political marathon too ends where Venkataraman's did, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan\".[41]\n\nPolitical party role[edit]\nMukherjee was \"very well respected within the party social circles\".[42] Media accounts describe him as having \"a reputation as a number-crunching politician with a phenomenal memory and an unerring survival instinct\".[43]\nHe became a member of the Congress Working Committee on 27 January 1978. He also became a member of the Central Parliamentary Board of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) that year. Mukherjee briefly held the position of treasurer of the AICC and the Congress party in 1978.[23]\nHe was appointed chairman of the Campaign Committee of the AICC for conducting National Elections to Parliament in 1984, 1991, 1996, and 1998. He was chairman of the Central Election Coordination Committee of the AICC from 28 June 1999 to 2012. He was appointed to the Central Election Committee on 12 December 2001. Mukherjee was appointed General Secretary of the AICC in 1998.[23] In 1997, he was voted Outstanding Parliamentarian by the Indian Parliamentary Group.[44]\nAfter Sonia Gandhi reluctantly agreed to join politics, Mukherjee was one of her mentors, guiding her through difficult situations with examples of how her mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi, would have done things.[45] His talents were on display during the negotiations for the Patents Amendment Bill in early 2005. Congress was committed to passing an IP bill, but their allies in the United Progressive Alliance from the Left front had a long tradition of opposing some of the monopoly aspects of intellectual property. Mukherjee, as Defence Minister, was not formally involved but was roped in for his negotiation skills. He drew on many old allies including the CPI-M leader Jyoti Basu (former Chief Minister of West Bengal), and formed new intermediary positions, which included product patents. Then, he had to convince his own colleagues, including commerce minister Kamal Nath, who at one point said...\"An imperfect legislation is better than no legislation\".[46] Finally, on 23 March 2005, the bill was approved.[46]\nIndia Today wrote that Mukherjee's role in \"skillfully pushing through the historic 123 Agreement and treaty with the Nuclear Suppliers Group\" may have saved the UPA-II government from the 2008 motion of no confidence.[47]\nMukherjee played a crucial role in steering the Cabinet pre-Lok Sabha elections when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh underwent a heart bypass surgery in 2008\u201309 by taking additional charges as chairman of the Cabinet Committee of Political Affairs and Union Minister in the Finance Ministry despite already being Union Minister of External Affairs.[48]\nMukherjee's political skills and long experience in government have also led him to head a large number of committees of ministers in the government. At the time of his resignation, on being nominated as the UPA's presidential candidate, Mukherjee was heading several Groups of Ministers (GoMs) and Empowered Groups of Ministers (EGoMs).[49][50]\n\nUnion Cabinet Minister[edit]\nMinister of Defence[edit]\n Defence Minister Mukherjee escorts Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld as he arrives at the South Block building in New Delhi, 2004.\nManmohan Singh appointed Mukherjee as the Minister of Defence of India when the Congress Party once again came to power in 2004. Mukherjee held the post until 2006. He expanded co-operation with the United States during his tenure. The Times of India reported on the Wikileaks cables release and noted how the U.S. was full of praise for the \"uniformed leadership\" of Indian armed forces. Mukherjee in June 2005 had inked the ten-year Indo-US Defence Framework deal.[51]\nDespite increasing co-operation with the United States, Mukherjee maintained that Russia would remain India's 'topmost' defence partner. He asserted that \"Russia has been and will remain India's largest defence partner in the years to come\" while inaugurating the 5th session of the Indo-Russian Inter-Governmental Commission on Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-MTC) in Moscow in 2005.[52]\nRussia and India held their first joint anti-terror war games in Rajasthan in October 2005, during which Mukherjee and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov narrowly escaped injury after a heavy mortar landed several metres from their platform.[53] The Russian ministry subsequently declared its hopes to follow up joint military exercises in India with further joint exercises on Russian territory.[53]\n\n External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee with US President George W. Bush in 2008\nMinister of External Affairs[edit]\n External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee with Secretary Condoleezza Rice after signing the India\u2013United States Civil Nuclear Agreement\nMukherjee was appointed External Affairs Minister of India in 1995. Under his leadership, India was made \"Full Dialogue Partner\" of ASEAN as part of the Look East foreign policy initiated by Narasimha Rao. Mukherjee left the position in 1996.[54][55]\nHis second term began in 2006. He oversaw the successful signing of the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement with the U.S. government and then with the Nuclear Suppliers Group, allowing India to participate in civilian nuclear trade in spite of not having signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Mukherjee played a crucial role in mobilising world opinion against Pakistan after the 2008 Mumbai attacks. He left the position a year later to take over the Finance Ministry of India.[28]\nWhen asked what legacy he wanted to leave behind as Foreign Minister of India, Mukherjee replied, \"As the [man] who prepared Indian diplomacy to address the challenges of a more globalised, interdependent and uncertain world\".[47]\n\nMinister of Commerce and Industry[edit]\nMukherjee thrice served as Commerce Minister of India. His first stints were in the Indira Gandhi government from 1980 to 1982 and again in 1984.[25] His third stint in the 1990s saw him contribute significantly to the negotiations which led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization.[28]\n\nMinister of Finance[edit]\n Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee with United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Washington, D.C., 2011\nMukherjee's first stint as the Finance Minister of India was during the Indira Gandhi government in 1982. He presented his first annual budget in 1982\u201383. His first term was noted for the work he did to improve the finances of the government and for successfully returning the last instalment of India's first \nIMF loan.[36] Mukherjee signed the letter appointing Manmohan Singh as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India in 1982.[32] He was accused of patronage practices in the Ambani\u2013Wadia industrial feuds.[56]\nMukherjee was credited with being an early reformer of the Indian economy. India Today wrote: \"Operation Forward, which [Mukherjee] and then Industries Minister Charanjit Chanana launched in the early 1980s, started the liberalisation process that flowered under Rao and Manmohan Singh\".[47] A Left-wing magazine once commented that \"socialism did not grow out of the pipe Mukherjee smoked\".[47]\nMukherjee was removed from his position as Finance Minister by Rajiv Gandhi in 1984. Gandhi had wished to bring in his own team of staff to govern India.[41] Mukherjee was replaced even though he was rated as the best Finance Minister in the World that year according to a survey by Euromoney magazine.[36]\nHe returned to handling the finances of India during the premiership of Narasimha Rao, after being appointed Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission.[57] During Mukherjee's tenure of 1991 to 1996, Dr. Manmohan Singh as Finance Minister oversaw many economic reforms to end the Licence Raj system and help open the Indian economy.[58]\n\n Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee during the World Economic Summit 2009 in New Delhi\nMukherjee once again became the Finance Minister of India in 2009. He presented the annual budgets in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The 2010\u201311 budget included the country's first explicit target to cut public debt as a proportion of the GDP and Mukherjee targeted a budget deficit reduction of 4.1% of the GDP in the fiscal year 2012\u201313, from 6.5% in 2008\u201309.[59]\nHe implemented many tax reforms, including scrapping the Fringe Benefits Tax and the Commodities Transaction Tax.[60] He implemented the Goods and Services Tax during his tenure.[61] These reforms were well received by major corporate executives and economists. The introduction of retrospective taxation, however, has been criticised by some economists.[62]\n\n Finance Minister of India Pranab Mukherjee with President of the World Bank Group Jim Yong Kim at the Ministry of Finance HQ in New Delhi, 2012\nMukherjee expanded funding for several social sector schemes including the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. He also supported budget increases for improving literacy and health care. He expanded infrastructure programmes such as the National Highway Development Programme.[63] Electricity coverage was also expanded during his tenure. Mukherjee also reaffirmed his commitment to the principle of fiscal prudence as some economists expressed concern about the rising fiscal deficits during his tenure, the highest since 1991. Mukherjee declared the expansion in government spending was only temporary.[64]\nIn 2010, he was awarded \"Finance Minister of the Year for Asia\" by Emerging Markets, the daily newspaper of record for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Mukherjee was praised for \"the confidence [he] has inspired in key stakeholders, by virtue of his fuel price reforms, fiscal transparency and inclusive growth strategies\".[65] The Banker also recognised him as \"Finance Minister of the Year.\"[59]\nMukherjee's final years at the finance ministry were not considered a success. The NDTV, upon his resignation in June 2012, wrote: \"There [had] been a clamour from many quarters for a change in the Finance Ministry, with Mr Mukherjee having faced flak for several decisions where politics seemed to overwhelm economic imperatives\".[66]\n\nOther positions[edit]\nMukherjee was chairman of the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata. He also held the following posts: chairman and president of the Rabindra Bharati University and the Nikhil Bharat Banga Sahitya Sammelan; trustee of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad and the Bidhan Memorial Trust. He also served on the Planning Board of the Asiatic Society.[25]\n\nPresident of India[edit]\nSee also: 2012 Indian presidential election\nPresidential styles ofPranab Mukherjee Reference styleHon'ble President[67] Shri Pranab Mukherjee (within India)Spoken stylePresident MukherjeeAlternative styleMr. President\n President Mukherjee with President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Indian Vice-President Mohammad Ansari\nMukherjee was nominated as the presidential candidate of the United Progressive Alliance on 15 June 2012 after considerable political intrigue.[68][69] The elections were scheduled to be conducted on 19 July 2012 and the results were expected to be announced on 22 July 2012.  The nominee of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was P. A. Sangma.[70] To file his nomination for the presidential poll on 28 June, Mukherjee resigned from the government on 26 June 2012.[66]\nIn the election, Mukherjee received 713,763 votes, while Sangma had 315,987.[71] In his victory speech, delivered outside his residence before the results were officially announced, he said:\n\nI would like to express my deep gratitude to all of you who are waiting. The figure has crossed 7\u00a0lakhs, only one state remains. The final figure will come from the returning officer. I would like to thank the people of India for electing me to this high office. The enthusiasm, the warmth of the people was remarkable. I have received much more from the people of this country, from the Parliament, than I have given. Now I have been entrusted with the responsibility of protecting and defending the constitution as President. I will try and justify the trust of the people. I would like to reciprocate the congratulation Shri Purno Sangma has extended.[72]\nMukherjee was sworn in by the Chief Justice of India on 25 July 2012,[73] becoming the first Bengali to hold the post of President of India.[39] After being administered the oath of office, he stated that we are in the midst of a fourth world war of terror (the third was the Cold war) and what minutes of peace can achieve cannot be achieved in many years of war.[74]\n\n Mukherjee with leaders of Russia, China, South Africa, Vietnam, and Egypt during the Moscow Victory Day Parade, 9\u00a0May 2015\nCongress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh both congratulated Mukherjee on his election as president.[75] Former Communist leader Somnath Chatterjee termed Mukherjee as one of \"the best parliamentarians and statesmen of India\" and said the country \"has got the most able man for the top job\".[76] Opposition leader Sharad Yadav declared \"the nation needed a president like Pranab Mukherjee\".[77] Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit commented and said Mukherjee will be \"one of the wisest presidents\". She further marvelled at the fact that parties in the opposition ranks supported Mukherjee. \"Even the NDA broke up and wanted to vote for the president to be Pranab Mukherjee\".[78] The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was reportedly \"shocked\" and \"upset\" at the cross-voting for Mukherjee by its legislative members.[79] However, BJP party president Nitin Gadkari congratulated Mukherjee and said \"I extend my hearty congratulations to Pranab Mukherjee on his election today as the new President of India\". Gadkari further declared \"I am sure that the country will make further development and progress. I wish him all success and a bright future\".[80]\nZee News noted: \"What is striking about [Mukherjee] is that after more than four decades in public life, the Opposition had no ammunition against him after he was declared UPA\u2019s choice for President. In spite of Team Anna making some noise about him being involved in some corruption cases, it has been more or less an easy ride for Pranab to Raisina Hill. Once when Sonia Gandhi announced his name, most of the allies and the Opposition came on board. Whereas, NDA partner JD(U) saw no merit in opposing him, one of the bitter critics of the Congress Shiv Sena too toed the line a little too easily. This support was not for Congress but for [Mukherjee]\".[38]\nCriminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 was promulgated by Pranab Mukherjee on 3\u00a0February 2013, providing for the amendment of the Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on laws related to sexual offences.[81][82] As of July 2015, President Mukherjee had rejected 24 mercy pleas including those of Yakub Memon, Ajmal Kasab, and Afzal Guru.[83][84] Pranab Mukherjee becomes first President of India to reply all the mercy petitions in his term for the death row inmates and also replying the petitions of former Presidents.[85]\nIn January 2017, Mukherjee announced that he would not contest the 2017 Presidential elections, citing \"advanced age and failing health\".[86]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nPranab Mukherjee married Suvra Mukherjee on 13 July 1957. Suvra Mukherjee was born at Narail, Bengal Presidency, British India. She moved to Kolkata while she was 10 and married Pranab in 1957.[87] The couple had two sons and a daughter.[25] Suvra died on 18 August 2015, aged 74, of heart failure, while Mukherjee was still in office.[88] Their elder son, Abhijit Mukherjee, was a Congress MP from Jangipur, West Bengal, until 2019. He was elected in a by-election after his father vacated the seat. Before his election to the Lok Sabha, Abhijit was an MLA from Nalhati in Birbhum.[89]\nMukherjee was inspired by Deng Xiaoping and quoted him quite frequently.[90] His hobbies were reading, gardening, and music.[25]\nHis daughter Sharmistha Mukherjee is a Kathak dancer and politician of the Indian National Congress.[91]\nMukherjee celebrated the Durga Puja at his ancestral home in Mirati village.[92] He used to make it a point to be at Mirati village every year to take part in the four-day rituals, the puja having a \"social dimension\" for him. \"I want to avail this opportunity to be with the people of my area\", Mukherjee said during a puja ceremony on 4\u00a0October 2011.[92]\n\nIllness and death[edit]\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, on 10 August 2020, Mukherjee announced on Twitter that he had tested positive for COVID-19 prior to a surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain.[93] He was admitted to the hospital after accidentally slipping and falling in his bathroom.[94][95] He was on ventilator support and in critical condition at the Army's Research and Referral (R&R) hospital in Delhi.[96]\nOn 13 August, the hospital reported that Mukherjee was in a deep coma after he underwent brain surgery; however, his vital parameters remained stable.[97][98] On 19 August, the R&R said that Mukherjee's health condition had declined as he had developed a lung infection.[99] On 25 August, his renal parameters became \"slightly deranged\", with the condition worsening days later.[100][101]\nMukherjee died on 31 August 2020, aged 84, which was confirmed by his son Abhijit Mukherjee via Twitter.[102][103] His death came after the attending hospital confirmed that his health had deteriorated early that day, stating that he had been in septic shock since a day earlier, which was caused by his lung infection.[104][105]\nCondolences poured in immediately from leaders of both India and other nations. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the President Ramnath Kovind, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, Home Minister Amit Shah, and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi conveyed their condolences via Twitter.[106][107][108] The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin,[109] the President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani,[110] the President of the Maldives, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih,[111] the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina,[112] the Prime Minister of Bhutan, Lotay Tshering, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa, and the Prime Minister of Nepal, K.
