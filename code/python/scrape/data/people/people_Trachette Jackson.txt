{"name": "Trachette Jackson", "content": "Trachette Levon Jackson  (born July 24, 1972) is an American mathematician who is a professor of mathematics at the University of Michigan and is known for work in mathematical oncology.[1] She uses many different approaches, including continuous and discrete mathematical models, numerical simulations, and experiments to study tumor growth and treatment. Specifically, her lab is interested in \"molecular pathways associated with intratumoral angiogenesis\", \"cell-tissue interactions associated with tumor-induced angiogenesis,\" and \"tumor heterogeneity and cancer stem cells\".[2]\n Jackson's parents were in the military and traveled frequently through her childhood; as a teenager, she lived in Mesa, Arizona. There, in a summer calculus course, her talent for mathematics brought her to the attention of Arizona State University mathematics professor Joaqu\u00edn Bustoz, Jr. She went on to undergraduate studies at ASU, originally intending to study engineering, but steered to mathematics by Bustoz.[3]  From there, her interest in pure math developed into an interest in mathematical biology when she attended a talk by her future PhD advisor, James D. Murray, on the mathematics of pattern formation and, \"how the leopard got its spots.\"[4] She graduated in 1994, and earned her master's and Ph.D. at the University of Washington in 1996 and 1998.[5][6]\nAfter postdoctoral research at the University of Minnesota, Environmental Protection Agency, and Duke University, she joined the Michigan faculty in 2000, and was promoted to full professor in 2008.[7]\n She was awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship in 2003,[8] becoming the second African-American woman after Kathleen Adebola Okikiolu to become a Sloan Fellow in mathematics.
