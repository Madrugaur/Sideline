{"name": "Luis E. Miramontes", "content": "Luis Ernesto Miramontes C\u00e1rdenas (March 16, 1925 \u2013 September 13, 2004) was a Mexican chemist known as the co-inventor of the progestin norethisterone used in one of the first three oral contraceptives.\n Miramontes was born in Tepic, Nayarit. He obtained his first Degree in chemical engineering at the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM). He was a founding researcher of the Institute of Chemistry of UNAM, specializing mainly in the area of Organic Chemistry. He was a professor of the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, Director and professor of the School of Chemistry at the Universidad Iberoamericana, and deputy Director of Research at the Mexican Institute of Petroleum (IMP). Miramontes was a member of diverse scientific societies, such as the American Chemical Society (Emeritus), the Mexican Institute of Chemical Engineers, the National Institute of Chemical and Chemical Engineers, the Chemical Society of Mexico, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the New York Academy of Sciences.\n He died in Mexico City in 2004.\n The scientific contributions of Luis Miramontes are extensive, including numerous publications and nearly 40 national and international patents in different areas such as organic chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, petrochemistry and atmospheric chemistry and polluting agents. Among his multiple contributions to world science is the synthesis on October 15, 1951, when Miramontes was only 26 years old, of norethisterone (norethindrone), that was to become the progestin used in one of the first three oral contraceptives (combined oral contraceptive pills). For this reason, Luis Miramontes is considered by Lilia Miramontes to be its inventor.[1] Carl Djerassi, Luis Miramontes and George Rosenkranz of the Mexican chemical company Syntex are listed on the patent for norethisterone as its co-inventors. Djerassi \"is now known sometimes as the 'Father of the Pill'\".[2] The historians, nevertheless, agree that the invention, or the first synthesis, is the work of Miramontes.[3][4]  For example, the Nobel laureate Max Perutz[5] states that \"On October 15th, 1951, the chemistry student Luis Miramontes, working under the direction of Djerassi and the director of the laboratory Jorge Rosenkranz synthesized the compound\". Djerassi himself affirms that it was, in fact, Miramontes who conducted the last step of the first synthesis of the compound: \"On 15 October 1951, Luis Miramontes, a young Mexican chemist doing his undergraduate bachelor's thesis work at Syntex completed the synthesis of the 19-nor-17\u03b1-ethynyltestosterone or, for short 'norethisterone'\u2014which turned out to be the first oral contraceptive to be synthesized. Lecture audiences are always intrigued when I display a slide showing the carefully dated and hand-written lab protocol of the very last step in that synthesis conducted by Miramontes, in which the elements of acetylene are added to impart oral activity.\"[6] The scientific article reporting the synthesis of 19-nor-17\u03b1-ethynyltestosterone (norethisterone) has Miramontes as the second author.[7] Finally, the last step of the synthesis method was registered, on October 15, 1951, in page 114 of the Miramontes's personal laboratory notebook (signed).\n In a 2006 essay published in the FASEB Journal, the director of the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology said: \"Another aspect of the Nobel Prizes that is a perennial topic of discussion concerns those discoveries, inventions, or advances that go unrecognized altogether. One is the birth control pill. I have just mentioned the Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research, where pioneering work by Gregory Pincus and M. C. Chang was carried out in the 1950s that led to the first birth control pill. Pincus died in 1967 at age 63. The tributaries flowing into the development of the oral contraceptive were numerous and temporally distributed across two decades, going back to the extraction of a substance from the roots of a jungle plant by Russell Marker that was readily convertible to pregnanediol and then to progesterone in two steps, the subsequent chemical synthesis of progestins by Carl Djerassi, Luis Miramontes, and George Rosenkranz, and the discovery by Gregory Pincus and M.C. Chang at the Worcester Foundation that a compound sent to be tested by the G. D. Searle Pharmaceutical Company was, contrary to expectations, a potent anti-ovulatory progestin.\"[8]\n Luis E.

The name of Luis Miramontes appeared next to Pasteur, Edison, Bell, the  Wright brothers and others of equal stature. It was included in the \"USA Inventors Hall of Fame\".[9]\nIn 1985 he received the \"Estado de Mexico\" Medal, in the area of sciences and arts;[10] as well as a public recognition from the government of the state of Nayarit, and an academic recognition from the Technological Institute of Tepic.\nHe received the Mexican National Prize on Chemistry \"Andr\u00e9s Manuel del Rio\" in 1986.\nIn 1989 he became a \"pugwashite\", that is, member of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, organization promoting peace and world development, after attending the  39th Pugwash Conference: Building Global Security through Cooperation held at Cambridge, USA.[11] The Pugwash Conferences were awarded the Peace Nobel Prize  in 1995.\nIn 1992 the General Hospital of Zone no. 1, of the Mexican Institute of Social Security, in Tepic, Nayarit, was named \"Luis Ernesto Miramontes Cardenas Hospital\".[12]\nIn 1994 the Mexican Ministry of Health recognized his scientific contributions, when installing the National Program on Family Planning in Mexico.\nHe received in 1998, on behalf of the government of the state of Nayarit, the \"Amado Nervo\" Medal.\n Luis E. Miramontes (right) with Nobel Laureate Mario Molina, ca. 1995\nIn 2000, the contraceptive pill was denominated three times as one of the most important inventions of the last 2000 years, by a group of outstanding persons, that included several Nobel laurates.[13]\nIn 2001, at the 50th Anniversary of the synthesis of norethisterone, the UNAM and the Mexican Ministry of Health, organized individual tributes to Miramontes and Rosencraz.\nIn 2003, norethisterone was considered one of the most important 17 molecules that have influenced the history of humankind.[2]\nIn 2004, the invention of Luis E. Miramontes was chosen as the twentieth most important one of all the times. The election was organized by SCENTA, an initiative of The Engineering and Technology Board of the United Kingdom.\nIn 2005, the Mexican Academy of Sciences, named the invention of Miramontes as the Mexican most important contribution to world science ever.[14]\nIn 2009, the BBC of London nominated him as one of the five most important Latin American researchers of all the times[15]\nIn 2009, The School of Chemistry of UNAM recognized him as one of the most successful and important scientists to have received a degree from it[16]\nIn 2009, The School of Chemistry of UNAM honored him by naming the 2009 year prize QUIMIUNAM after him.[17]\nIn 2010, TCE Today, published by the IChemE regarded him \"one of the chemical engineers who changed the world\" [18]\nIn 2010, The Innovators of America initiative nominated him a top Icon & Legend of America[19]\nIn 2011 was named one of the world\u2019s most influential chemical engineers of all time by the IChemE (Institution of Chemical Engineers).[20]\nIn 2011, The Mexican Institute of Chemical Engineers IMIQ named after him the Prize \"Ing.
