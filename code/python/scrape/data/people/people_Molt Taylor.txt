{"name": "Molt Taylor", "content": "\n Moulton B. \"Molt\" Taylor (September 29, 1912 \u2013 November 16, 1995) was an American aeronautical engineer famed for his work designing, developing, and manufacturing on a small scale one of the first practical flying cars, the Aerocar.\n Taylor was born in Portland, Oregon and studied engineering at the University of Washington. After graduation, he was accepted into the United States Navy as a pilot during World War II, and spent much of the war working on the Navy's Gorgon missile program, for which he was awarded the Legion of Merit medal. Shortly after the war, he designed his first flying car, the Aerocar, and founded Aerocar International in Longview, Washington, to develop, manufacture and market the aircraft. To date, it remains the closest that any such design came to actual mass production, but eventually only six were built.\n Although Taylor continued to push for the viability of the flying car throughout the rest of his life, he also designed a number of only slightly more conventional designs for the homebuilt aircraft market, including the Taylor Coot amphibian and the Aerocar IMP family of light sport planes (which consists of the Mini, Micro and Ultra IMP).\n In a 1979 article about the future of flight past the year 2000, Taylor somewhat inaccurately predicted widespread use of flying autos and pusher configurations, however he did accurately predict the mainstream use of carbon materials for lightweight spars and wing ribs.[1]\n He also gave frequent help and advice to the Klapmeier brothers throughout the 1980s on their first design, the pusher-propeller homebuilt Cirrus VK-30.[2]\n He was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1960.[3] In 1975, he received the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) Dr. August Raspet Memorial Award for \"significant advancements in the field of light aircraft design\". Six days before his death in 1995, Taylor was inducted into the EAA Hall of Fame.\n The Kelso-Longview Regional Airport is also known as the \"Molt Taylor Field\".\n ", "tags": ["1912 births", "1995 deaths", "People from Portland, Oregon", "American aerospace engineers", "University of Washington College of Engineering alumni", "People from Longview, Washington", "20th-century American engineers", "Engineers from Oregon", "Engineers from Washington (state)", "Aircraft designers", "Articles needing additional references from November 2011", "All articles needing additional references", "Use mdy dates from December 2019", "Use American English from December 2019", "All Wikipedia articles written in American English", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.
