{"name": "Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik", "content": "\n Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik (pronunciation\u00a0(help\u00b7info)) (23 January 1872 \u2013 7 January 1957) was a Slovene architect who had a major impact on the modern architecture of Vienna, Prague and of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, most notably by designing the iconic Triple Bridge and the Slovene National and University Library building, as well as the embankments along the Ljubljanica River, the Ljubljana Central Market buildings, the Ljubljana cemetery, parks, plazas etc. His architectural imprint on Ljubljana has been compared to the impact Antoni Gaud\u00ed had on Barcelona.[1]\n His style is associated with the Vienna Secession style of architecture (a type of Art Nouveau). Besides in Ljubljana, he worked in Vienna, Belgrade and on Prague Castle. He influenced the avant-garde Czech Cubism. He is also a founding member of the Ljubljana School of Architecture, joining it upon an invitation by Ivan Vurnik, another notable Ljubljana architect.\n Ple\u010dnik was born in Ljubljana, Carniola, Austria-Hungary, present-day Slovenia, the son of Helena (Molka) and Andrej Ple\u010dnik.[2] He studied with noted Viennese architect and educator Otto Wagner and worked in Wagner's architecture office until 1900.\n From 1900 through 1910, while practicing in the Wagner's office in Vienna, he designed the Langer House (1900) and the Zacherlhaus (1903\u20131905).\n His 1910\u20131913 Church of the Holy Spirit (Heilig-Geist-Kirche) is remarkable for its innovative use of poured-in-place concrete as both structure and exterior surface, and also for its abstracted classical form language. Most radical is the church's crypt, with its slender concrete columns and angular, cubist capitals and bases.\n In 1911, Ple\u010dnik moved to Prague, where he taught at the college of arts and crafts. The first president of the new Czechoslovak Republic from 1918 onwards, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk, appointed Ple\u010dnik chief architect for the 1920 renovation of Prague Castle. From 1920 until 1934 Ple\u010dnik completed a wide range of projects at the castle, including renovation of gardens and courtyards, the design and installation of monuments and sculptures, and the design of numerous new interior spaces, including the Ple\u010dnik Hall completed in 1930, which features three levels of abstracted Doric colonnades.  His final work in Prague was the Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord (Roman Catholic, 1929\u201332).\n Upon the 1921 establishment of the Ljubljana School of Architecture in his hometown of Ljubljana, he was invited by the fellow Slovene architect Ivan Vurnik to become a founding faculty member and moved to teach architecture at the University of Ljubljana. Ple\u010dnik would remain in Ljubljana until his death, and it is there that his influence as an architect is most noticeable.\n Ple\u010dnik gave the capital of Slovenia, the city of Ljubljana, its modern identity by designing iconic buildings such as the Slovene National and University Library building. He also designed other notable buildings, including the Vzajemna Insurance Company Offices, and contributed to many civic improvements. He renovated the city's bridges and the Ljubljanica River banks, and designed the Ljubljana Central Market buildings, the Ljubljana cemetery, parks, plazas etc. Buildings designed by Ple\u010dnik were built by the constructor Matko Curk.[3]\n During the Communist period of Slovene history Ple\u010dnik fell out of favor as a Catholic[citation needed] and his teaching role at the university was gradually reduced because he was over 70 years old. In 1947, at the invitation of the president of the Slovene People\u2019s Assembly to design a new Parliament building, Ple\u010dnik proposed the Cathedral of Freedom (also known as the Ple\u010dnik Parliament) where he wanted to raze the Ljubljana Castle and to build a monumental octagonal building instead. In 1952, Ljubljana city leaders asked Ple\u010dnik to remodel the Kri\u017eanke monastery into a venue for the Ljubljana Festival, his last big Ljubljana project. Other projects he completed at that time included the renovation of the Pre\u0161eren Theater, plus the Ple\u010dnik Arcades, stairway and fountain, all in Kranj, the reconstruction of churches, the design of the Pavilion on Brijuni Islands (Tito's summer state residence), and numerous National Liberation War monuments (in Ljubljana-Trnovo, Vipava, Rade\u010de, \u010crna na Koro\u0161kem, Dolenja vas, Sevnica, La\u0161ko, Split, Kraljevo, etc.). For his work he twice received the Pre\u0161eren Award, in 1949 and 1952 for his life's work. Ple\u010dnik died in 1957 and received an official state funeral in \u017dale, attended by many political, cultural and church leaders.\n In the 1980s, with postmodernist interest in Ple\u010dnik's work, the general interest in him has been revived, as well, after being forgotten during the 1960s and 1970s.[citation needed] Since then, Ple\u010dnik's legacy has been commemorated in various ways, most notably in the 1990s on the Slovene 500 tolar banknote, with the National and University Library of Slovenia depicted on the reverse.[4][5]\n The unrealized Cathedral of Freedom designed by Ple\u010dnik is featured on the Slovene 10 cent euro coin.[1] Slovenska akropola is the title of a 1987 album by the Slovene industrial music group Laibach. During August 2008, a maquette of the Parliament was featured at the Project Ple\u010dnik exhibition on the architect's life, held at the Council of the European Union building in Brussels, Belgium on the occasion of the Slovene EU Presidency. The exhibition's curator Boris Podrecca described the Parliament as \"the most charismatic object\" of Ple\u010dnik's opus.[6]\n In addition, on 23 January 2012, to celebrate the 140th anniversary of Ple\u010dnik's birth, a picture of the Triple Bridge was featured as the official Google logo (Doodle) adaptation in Slovenia.[1]\n Ple\u010dnik's home in Ljubljana houses a museum of his life and work.[7]\n There are several busts and sculptures of him situated around the national capital (Ljubljana) as a tourist attractions or as proud reminders of his works and legacy.\n Villa Langer (1901)\n Villa Loos (1901)\n Villa Weidmann (1902)\n House Langer (1902)\n Zacherlhaus (1905)\n Tomb for Heinrich Peham von Bojernberg (1906)\n Lacknergasse 98 (1907)\n Villa Gra\u00dfberger (1908)\n Borromaeus fountain (1909)\n Herbststra\u00dfe 82 (1913)\n Silbergasse 35 (1915)\n Congress Square, Ljubljana (1928)\n Fountain at L\u00e1ny Castle (1930)\n Triple Bridge extension (1931)\n Trnovo Bridge (1931)\n Church of St. Anthony of Padua, Belgrade (1932)\n Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord, Prague (1932)\n Tomb for Anton\u00edn \u0160vehla (1933)\n Church of Mary of Lourdes, Zagreb (1934)\n Cemetery Navje (1938)\n Marian column, Ljubljana (1938)\n Jo\u017eamurka (1939)\n National and University Library of Slovenia (1941)\n Ljubljanica Sluice Gate (1944)\n The Garden of Paradise (1925)\n Flagpoles in front of the Matthiastor (1926)\n Observation platform (1927)\n Third courtyard and obelisk (1928)\n Wall garden (1928)\n Fountain (1928)\n Stairway (1931)\n Stairway (1932)\n ", "tags": ["Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik", "University of Ljubljana faculty", "Slovenian Roman Catholics", "Architects from Ljubljana", "Art Nouveau architects", "Members of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts", "Pre\u0161eren Award laureates", "Slovene Austro-Hungarians", "1872 births", "1957 deaths", "Recipients of the Order of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk", "Burials at \u017dale", "CS1 Slovenian-language sources (sl)", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles with Slovene-language sources (sl)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from April 2016", "Articles lacking in-text citations from January 2012", "All articles lacking in-text citations", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with hAudio microformats", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from January 2019", "Articles with unsourced statements from September 2013", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Slovenian architect\n\n\nThis article includes a list of general references, but it remains largely unverified because it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations.
