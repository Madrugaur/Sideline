{"name": "Nike Sun", "content": "Nike Sun is a probability theorist who works as an associate professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on leave from the department of statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. She won the Rollo Davidson Prize in 2017. Her research concerns phase transitions and the counting complexity of problems ranging from the Ising model in physics to the behavior of random instances of the Boolean satisfiability problem in computer science.\n Sun graduated from Harvard University in 2009 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and a master's degree in statistics,[1][2]\nand spent a year studying for the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge[2] before completing her doctorate at Stanford University in 2014.
