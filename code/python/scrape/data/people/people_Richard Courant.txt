{"name": "Richard Courant", "content": "Richard Courant (January 8, 1888 \u2013 January 27, 1972) was a German American mathematician. He is best known by the general public for the book What is Mathematics?, co-written with Herbert Robbins.\n Courant was born in Lublinitz, in the Prussian Province of Silesia. His parents were Siegmund Courant and Martha Courant n\u00e9e Freund of Oels. Edith Stein was Richard's cousin on the paternal side. During his youth his parents moved often, including to Glatz, then to Breslau and in 1905 to Berlin. He stayed in Breslau and entered the university there, then continued his studies at the University of Z\u00fcrich and the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He became David Hilbert's assistant in G\u00f6ttingen and obtained his doctorate there in 1910. He was obliged to serve in World War I, but was wounded shortly after enlisting and therefore dismissed from the military. Courant left the University of M\u00fcnster in 1921 to take over Erich Hecke's position at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.[1] There he founded the Mathematical Institute, which he headed as director from 1928 until 1933.\n Courant left Germany in 1933, earlier than many Jewish escapees. He did not lose his position due to being Jewish, as his previous service as a front-line soldier exempted him; however, his public membership in the social-democratic left was reason enough (for the Nazis) for dismissal.[2]\n In 1936, after one year at Cambridge, Courant accepted a professorship at New York University in New York City. There he founded an institute for graduate studies in applied mathematics. The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (as it was renamed in 1964) is now one of the most respected research centers in applied mathematics.[3]\n Courant and David Hilbert authored the influential textbook Methoden der mathematischen Physik, which, with its revised editions, is still current and widely used since its publication in 1924. With Herbert Robbins he coauthored a popular overview of higher mathematics, intended for the general public, titled What is Mathematics?. With Fritz John he also coauthored the two-volume work Introduction to Calculus and Analysis, first published in 1965.\n Courant's name is also attached to the finite element method,[4] with his numerical treatment of the plain torsion problem for multiply-connected domains, published in 1943.[5]\nThis method is now one of the ways to solve partial differential equations numerically. Courant is a namesake of the Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy condition and the Courant minimax principle.\n Courant died of a stroke in New Rochelle, New York on January 27, 1972.[6]\n Commenting upon his analysis of experimental results from in-laboratory soap film formations, Courant believed that the existence of a physical solution does not obviate mathematical proof. Here is a quote from Courant on his mathematical perspective:\n Empirical evidence can never establish mathematical existence\u2013nor can the mathematician's demand for existence be dismissed by the physicist as useless rigor. Only a mathematical existence proof can ensure that the mathematical description of a physical phenomenon is meaningful.[7] In 1912 Courant married Nelly Neumann, who had earned her doctorate at Breslau in synthetic geometry in 1909.  They lived together in G\u00f6ttingen until they were divorced in 1916.  She was later murdered by the Nazis in 1942 for being Jewish.[8]\n In 1919 Courant married Nerina (Nina) Runge (1891\u20131991), a daughter of the G\u00f6ttingen professor for Applied Mathematics, Carl Runge (of Runge\u2013Kutta fame).\n Richard and Nerina had four children: Ernest, a particle physicist and innovator in particle accelerators; Gertrude (1922\u20132014), a PhD biologist and wife of the mathematician J\u00fcrgen Moser (1928\u20131999); Hans, a physicist who participated in the Manhattan Project; and Leonore (known as \"Lori,\" 1928\u20132015), a professional violist and wife of the mathematician Jerome Berkowitz (1928\u20131998) and subsequently wife of mathematician Peter Lax until her death.[9]\n ", "tags": ["1888 births", "1972 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "20th-century German mathematicians", "German military personnel of World War I", "Mathematical analysts", "Mathematics popularizers", "People associated with the finite element method", "Foreign Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United States", "Silesian Jews", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "University of M\u00fcnster faculty", "Academics of the University of Cambridge", "New York University faculty", "People associated with the University of Zurich", "University of Breslau alumni", "People from the Province of Silesia", "People from Lubliniec", "Scientists from New Rochelle, New York", "Textbook writers", "Knights Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "Fluid dynamicists", "Mathematicians from New York (state)", "Jewish scientists", "Fellows of the American Physical Society", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "CS1: long volume value", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "German American mathematician\nRichard CourantBorn(1888-01-08)January 8, 1888Lublinitz, German Empire(now Lubliniec, Poland)DiedJanuary 27, 1972(1972-01-27) (aged\u00a084)New Rochelle, New York, USCitizenshipGermanyUSAAlma\u00a0materUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenKnown\u00a0forCourant numberCourant minimax principleCourant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy conditionScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenUniversity of M\u00fcnsterUniversity of CambridgeNew York UniversityThesisOn the application of Dirichlet's principle to the problems of conformal mapping\u00a0(1910)Doctoral advisorDavid HilbertDoctoral studentsLeifur \u00c1sgeirssonHerbert BusemannWilliam FellerKurt FriedrichsHarold GradFritz JohnJoseph KellerEdgar KrahnMartin KruskalAnneli LaxHans LewyOtto NeugebauerFranz Rellich\n\nRichard Courant (January 8, 1888 \u2013 January 27, 1972) was a German American mathematician.
