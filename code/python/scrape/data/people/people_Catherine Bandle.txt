{"name": "Catherine Bandle", "content": "\nCatherine Bandle (born 22 March 1943)[1] is a Swiss mathematician known for her research on differential equations, including semilinear elliptic equations and reaction-diffusion equations, and for her book on isoperimetric inequalities. She is a professor emerita of mathematics at the University of Basel.[2]\n Bandle completed her doctorate (Dr. math.) at ETH Zurich in 1971. Her dissertation, Konstruktion isoperimetrischer Ungleichungen der mathematischen Physik aus solchen der Geometrie, concerned isoperimetric inequalities and was jointly supervised by Joseph Hersch and Alfred Huber.[3][1] Like Alice Roth before her, she received the ETH Silver Medal for her dissertation, and she continued at ETH Zurich for a habilitation in 1974. She was the first woman mathematician and one of the earliest women to earn a habilitation at ETH Zurich. She became a professor at the University of Basel in 1975 and remained there until her retirement in 2003.[4]\n Bandle is the author of the book Isoperimetric Inequalities and Applications (Pitman, 1980). It was only the second book to study the applications of isoperimetric inequalities in mathematical physics, after the 1951 book Isoperimetric Inequalities in Mathematical Physics by George P\u00f3lya and G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151, and at the time of its publication was considerably more up-to-date on recent developments in the subject.[5]\n ", "tags": ["1943 births", "Living people", "Swiss mathematicians", "Swiss women mathematicians", "ETH Zurich alumni", "University of Basel faculty", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "CS1 maint: untitled periodical", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from July 2020", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers"], "raw": "Swiss mathematician\n\nCatherine Bandle (born 22 March 1943)[1] is a Swiss mathematician known for her research on differential equations, including semilinear elliptic equations and reaction-diffusion equations, and for her book on isoperimetric inequalities.
