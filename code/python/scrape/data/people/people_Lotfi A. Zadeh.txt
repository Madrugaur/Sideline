Zadeh was enrolled in Alborz College, which was a Presbyterian missionary school, where he was educated for the next eight years, and where he met his future wife, Fay.[24] Zadeh says that he was \"deeply influenced\" by the \"extremely decent, fine, honest and helpful\" missionaries from the United States who ran the college. \"To me they represented the best that you could find in the United States \u2013 people from the Midwest with strong roots. They were really 'Good Samaritans' \u2013 willing to give of themselves for the benefit of others. So this kind of attitude influenced me deeply. It also instilled in me a deep desire to live in the United States.\"[25] During this time, Zadeh was awarded several patents.[24]\n Despite being more fluent in Russian than in Persian, Zadeh sat for the national university exams and placed third in the entire country.[24] As a student, he ranked first in his class in his first two years. In 1942, he graduated from the University of Tehran with a degree in electrical engineering, one of only three students in that field to graduate that year, due to the turmoil created by World War II, when the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union invaded Iran. Over 30,000 American soldiers were based there, and Zadeh worked with his father, who did business with them as a contractor for hardware and building materials.[26]\n In 1943, Zadeh decided to emigrate to the United States, and traveled to Philadelphia by way of Cairo after months of delay waiting for the proper papers or for the right ship to appear. He arrived in mid-1944, and entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a graduate student later that year.[26] While in the United States, he changed his name to Lotfi Asker Zadeh.[19]\n He received an MS degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1946, and then applied to Columbia University, as his parents had settled in New York City.[26] Columbia admitted him as a doctoral student, and offered him an instructorship as well.[26] He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Columbia in 1949, and became an assistant professor the next year.[23][26]\n Zadeh taught for ten years at Columbia, was promoted to Full Professor in 1957, and taught at the University of California, Berkeley from 1959 on. He published his seminal work on fuzzy sets in 1965, in which he detailed the mathematics of fuzzy set theory. In 1973 he proposed his theory of fuzzy logic.\n  Zadeh was called \"quick to shrug off nationalism, insisting there are much deeper issues in life\", and was quoted as saying in an interview: \"The question really isn't whether I'm American, Russian, Iranian, Azerbaijani, or anything else. I've been shaped by all these people and cultures and I feel quite comfortable among all of them.\"[27] He noted in the same interview: \"Obstinacy and tenacity. Not being afraid to get embroiled in controversy. That's very much a Turkish tradition. That's part of my character, too. I can be very stubborn. That's probably been beneficial for the development of Fuzzy Logic.\"[28] He described himself as \"an American, mathematically oriented, electrical engineer of Iranian descent, born in Russia.\"[23]\n Zadeh was married to Fay Zadeh and had two children, Stella Zadeh and Norman Zada.\n Zadeh died in his home in Berkeley, California,[3] on September 6, 2017, at the age of 96.[1][2] He is buried in the first Alley of Honor in Baku, Azerbaijan, the city in which he was born.[3] His funeral was well attended by \"highly respected people\", including the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev.[29] A month previous to his death, the University of Tehran had released an erroneous report that Zadeh had died, but withdrew it several days later.[30]\n According to Google Scholar, as of February 2021, Zadeh's work has been cited about 270,000 times in scholarly works, with the 1965 Fuzzy sets paper receiving more than 115,000 citations.[31]\n Zadeh, in his theory of fuzzy sets, proposed using a membership function (with a range covering the interval [0,1]) operating on the domain of all possible values.  He proposed new operations for the calculus of logic and showed that fuzzy logic was a generalisation of classical and Boolean logic. He also proposed fuzzy numbers as a special case of fuzzy sets, as well as the corresponding rules for consistent mathematical operations (fuzzy arithmetic).[32]\n Zadeh is also credited, along with John R. Ragazzini, in 1952, with having pioneered the development of the Z-transform method in discrete time signal processing and analysis. These methods are now standard in digital signal processing, digital control, and other discrete-time systems used in industry and research. He was an editor of the International Journal of Computational Cognition.\n Zadeh's most recent work included computing with words and perceptions.  His recent papers include From Search Engines to Question-Answering Systems\u2014The Role of Fuzzy Logic, Progress in Informatics, No. 1, 1\u20133, 2005; and Toward a Generalized Theory of Uncertainty (GTU)\u2014An Outline, Information Sciences, Elsevier, Vol. 172, 1\u201340, 2005.\n A complete list of publications is available here.\n Zadeh was a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Association for Computing Machinery, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence and the International Fuzzy Systems Association, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.[5] He was also a member of the Academies of Science of Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Finland, Korea and Poland, and of the International Academy of Systems Studies in Moscow. He received 24 honorary doctorates.[7]\n Awards received by Zadeh include, among many others:\n In 2014, the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society established the \"Lotfi A. Zadeh Pioneer Award\", which is given \"To honor a person or persons with outstanding and pioneering contributions to academic and/or industrial research in systems science and engineering, human-machine systems, and/or cybernetics.\"  The award is funding from a $100,000 donation from Zadeh's son, Norm Zadeh, which is administered by the IEEE. Nominees must have \"pioneered and developed innovative research, executed in either academe or industry, and has resulted in major scientific advances that are widely recognized in systems science and engineering, human-machine systems, and/or cybernetics. Contributions must have been made at least 15 years prior to the award date.\"[41]\n In February 2019, ADA University in Baku, Azerbaijan presented the first \"Lotfi Zadeh Scholarships\", which honor the academic success of undergraduate students in the university's School of IT and Engineering. Winners of the scholarship receive a complete tuition waiver for the semester or semester-equivalent in which they achieved a 4.0 average.[42]\n Notes\n Bibliography\n Further reading\n ", "tags": ["1921 births", "2017 deaths", "Artificial intelligence researchers", "Alborz High School alumni", "Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science alumni", "Control theorists", "Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery", "IEEE Medal of Honor recipients", "Fellow Members of the IEEE", "Azerbaijani logicians", "American logicians", "American computer scientists", "Iranian Azerbaijani mathematicians", "Iranian Azerbaijani academics", "Jewish American scientists", "Scientists from Baku", "Richard E.
