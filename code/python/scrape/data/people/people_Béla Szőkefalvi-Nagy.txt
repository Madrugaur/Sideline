His father, Gyula Sz\u0151kefalvi-Nagy was also a famed mathematician. Sz\u0151kefalvi-Nagy collaborated with Alfr\u00e9d Haar and Frigyes Riesz, founders of the Szegedian school of mathematics. He contributed to the theory of Fourier series and approximation theory. His most important achievements were made in functional analysis, especially, in the theory of Hilbert space operators. He was editor-in-chief of the Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Mathematik, the Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum,  and the Analysis Mathematica.
