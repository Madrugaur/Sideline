{"name": "Guarino Guarini", "content": "Camillo Guarino Guarini (17 January 1624 \u2013 6 March 1683) was an Italian architect of the Piedmontese Baroque, active in Turin as well as Sicily, France, and Portugal.\n He was a Theatine priest, mathematician, and writer.[1][2]\n Guarini was born in Modena. He was accepted as a Theatine novice in 1639, spent his novitiate at the monastery of San Silvestro al Quirinale in Rome, where he studied architecture, theology, philosophy and mathematics.[3] He returned to Modena in 1647, where he was ordained in 1648. He rose quickly in the Theatine hierarchy, becoming first auditor, then superintendent of works, treasurer, lecturer in philosophy, procuratore, and finally provost in 1654.  Prince Alfonso supported another candidate and Guarini was soon replaced and had to leave Modena. The next few years are poorly documented. He became a member of the Theatine House of Parma in 1656 and apparently visited Prague and Lisbon before publishing his play La Piet\u00e0 trionfante in Messina in 1660, where he was a lecturer in mathematics.[4]\n He wrote four mathematical books[1] in both Latin and Italian, of which Euclides adauctus is a work on descriptive geometry. In 1665, he published a mathematical-philosophical tract Placita Philosophica defending the geocentric universe against Copernicus and Galileo.[2]\n He designed a large number of public and private buildings in Turin, including the palaces of Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy (as well as his sister (Louise Christine of Savoy), the Royal Church of San Lorenzo (1666\u20131680), most of the Chapel of the Holy Shroud (housing the Shroud of Turin; begun in 1668 by Amedeo di Castellamonte), the Palazzo Carignano (1679\u201385), the Castle of Racconigi and many other public and ecclesiastical buildings at Modena, Messina, Verona, Vienna, Prague, Lisbon, and Paris. The Palazzo Carignano is regarded as one of the finest urban palaces of the second half of the 17th century in Italy.[1] Guarini appears to have been influenced by Borromini. Between 1657 and 1659 he stayed in Spain, where he studied Moorish buildings; this influenced the style of some of his buildings in Turin. In 1660 he settled in Messina.[5]\n Guarini died in Milan. In architecture, his successors include Filippo Juvarra, and Juvarra's pupil Bernardo Vittone. The latter published Guarini's designs in Architettura Civile in 1737.[1]\n Guarino Guarini is the subject of a composition, Guarini, the Master, written in 2004 by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero.\n Books on line: http://architectura.cesr.univ-tours.fr/Traite/Auteur/Guarini.asp?param=en\n ", "tags": ["1624 births", "1683 deaths", "17th-century Italian architects", "Italian architecture writers", "Italian male writers", "17th-century Italian mathematicians", "Architects from Modena", "Theatines", "Guarino Guarini buildings", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from June 2020", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Italian architect, priest, mathematician and writer\nFor the early Renaissance writer, see Guarino da Verona.\nGuarino GuariniBorn(1624-01-17)17 January 1624Modena, Duchy of Modena and ReggioDied6 March 1683(1683-03-06) (aged\u00a059)Milan, Duchy of MilanNationalityItalianOccupationArchitectBuildings\nChapel of the Holy Shroud\nRoyal Church of Saint Lawrence\nCastle of Racconigi (with Filippo Juvarra, Pelagio Palagi and Giovanni Battista Borra)\nPalazzo Carignano\n\n\nCamillo Guarino Guarini (17 January 1624 \u2013 6 March 1683) was an Italian architect of the Piedmontese Baroque, active in Turin as well as Sicily, France, and Portugal.\nHe was a Theatine priest, mathematician, and writer.[1][2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Works\n3 References in modern culture\n4 References\n5 Further reading\n6 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nGuarini was born in Modena.
