{"name": "Arthur Korn", "content": "Arthur Korn (May 20, 1870, Breslau, Germany \u2013 December 21/December 22, 1945, Jersey City, New Jersey) was a German physicist, mathematician and inventor. He was involved in the development of the fax machine, specifically the transmission of photographs or telephotography, known as the Bildtelegraph, related to early attempts at developing a practical mechanical television system.[1]\n Korn was the son of Jewish Moritz and Malwine Schottlaender.  He attended gymnasia in Breslau and Berlin.[2] He then studied physics and mathematics in Leipzig at the age of 15, from where he graduated in 1890. Afterwards, he studied in Berlin, Paris, London and W\u00fcrzburg. In 1895, he became a lecturer in law at the University of Munich, and was appointed professor in 1903. In 1914, he accepted the chair of physics at the Berlin Institute of Technology.\n Dr. Korn, being of Jewish descent, was dismissed from his post in 1935 with the rise of the Nazi Party. In 1939 he left Germany with his family and moved to the United States, entering via Mexico. There, he took the chair in physics and mathematics at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. He died in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1945.\n Korn experimented and wrote on long-distance photography, the phototelautograph.[2]\nHe pioneered the use of light sensitive selenium cells which supplanted the function of the stylus,[3] and used a Nernst lamp as a light source. On 17 October 1906, he transmitted a photograph of Crown Prince William over a distance of 1800\u00a0km.[3][4]\n At a 1913 conference in Vienna, Korn demonstrated the first successful visual telegraphic transmission of a cinematic recording. Under heavy media attention in 1923, he successfully transmitted an image of Pope Pius XI across the Atlantic Ocean, from Rome to Bar Harbor, Maine, the picture being hailed as a \"miracle of modern science\". From 1928 onwards, the German police used Korn's system to send photographs and fingerprints,[3] though the use of the \"phototelegraph\" in apprehending a thief from a Stuttgart bank in London was recorded in 1907, as well as the use of the technology by the media, with the French paper l'Illustration contracting for a French monopoly that lasted until 1909.[5]\n He also worked on potential theory and the mathematics of physics.[2] He was an Invited Speaker for the ICM in 1908 in Rome and in 1932 in Zurich.\n He also contributed numerous articles to such journals as Berichte der Bayrischen Akademie der Wissenschaft, Comptes Rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, and Naturwissenschaftliches Wochenschrift.\n ", "tags": ["1870 births", "1945 deaths", "German physicists", "Jewish inventors", "Stevens Institute of Technology faculty", "Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United States", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich faculty", "Technical University of Berlin faculty", "Leipzig University alumni", "Scientists from Wroc\u0142aw", "Jewish physicists", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the Encyclopedia Americana with a Wikisource reference", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "German physicist and mathematician\nFor the architect, see Arthur Korn (architect).\nArthur KornBornMay 20, 1870Breslau, Kingdom of Prussia(now Wroc\u0142aw, Poland)DiedDecember 22, 1945\u00a0(1945-12-23) (aged\u00a075)Jersey City, New JerseyNationalityGermanOccupationInventor\nArthur Korn (May 20, 1870, Breslau, Germany \u2013 December 21/December 22, 1945, Jersey City, New Jersey) was a German physicist, mathematician and inventor.
