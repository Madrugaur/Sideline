{"name": "Gigliola Staffilani", "content": "Fellow, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2014)\n Gigliola Staffilani (born March 24, 1966)[1] is an Italian-American[2][3] mathematician who works as the Abby Rockefeller Mauze Professor of Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[4][5][2] Her research concerns harmonic analysis and partial differential equations, including the Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation and Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n Staffilani grew up on a farm in Martinsicuro in central Italy, speaking only the local dialect, and with no books until her older brother brought some back from his school. Her father died when she was 10, and her mother decided that she did not need to continue on to high school, but her brother helped her change her mother's mind. She came to love mathematics at her school, and was encouraged by her teachers and brother to continue her studies, with the idea that she could return to Martinsicuro as a mathematics teacher. She earned a fellowship to study at the University of Bologna, where she earned a laurea in mathematics in 1989 with an undergraduate thesis on Green's functions for elliptic partial differential equations.[4][5][2]\n At the suggestion of one of her professors at Bologna, she moved to the University of Chicago for her graduate studies, to study with Carlos Kenig. This was a big change in her previous plans, because it would mean that she could not return to Martinsicuro. When she arrived at Chicago, still knowing very little English and not having taken the Test of English as a Foreign Language, she had the wrong type of visa to obtain the teaching fellowship she had been promised. She almost returned home, but remained after Paul Sally intervened and loaned her enough money to get by until the issue could be resolved.[5][2] At Chicago, she studied dispersive partial differential equations with Kenig,[5] earning a master's degree in 1991 and a Ph.D. in 1995.[4][6]\n After postdoctoral studies at the Institute for Advanced Study, Stanford University, and Princeton University, Staffilani took a tenure-track faculty position at Stanford in 1999, and earned tenure there in 2001. While at Stanford, she met her husband, Tomasz Mrowka, a mathematics professor at MIT, and after a year and a half found a faculty position closer to him at Brown University. She moved to MIT in 2002,[4][5] where, in 2006  she became the second  female full professor of mathematics.[2]\n Staffilani is a frequent collaborator with James Colliander, Markus Keel, Hideo Takaoka, and Terence Tao, forming a group known as the \"I-team\".[5][7] The name of this group has been said to come from the notation for a mollification operator used in the team's method of almost conserved quantities,[8] or as an abbreviation for \"interaction\", referring both to the teamwork of the group and to the interactions of light waves with each other.[9] The group's work was featured prominently in the 2006 Fields Medal citations for group member Tao.[7][9]\n Staffilani was a Sloan Fellow from 2000 to 2002.[4] In 2009-2010 she was a member of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.\nIn 2012 she became one of the inaugural fellows of the American Mathematical Society.[10] In 2014 she was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[11]\n ", "tags": ["1966 births", "Living people", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Italian mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "University of Bologna alumni", "University of Chicago alumni", "Stanford University faculty", "Princeton University faculty", "Brown University faculty", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Italian-American mathematician\nGigliola StaffilaniGigliola Staffilani (2013)BornMarch 24, 1966Nationality\nItaly\nUnited States\nAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ChicagoAwardsFellow, American Mathematical Society (2012)\nFellow, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2014)\n\nScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutions\nStanford University\nBrown University\nMIT\nThesisThe initial value problem for some dispersive differential equations\u00a0(1995)Doctoral advisorCarlos Kenig\nWebsitemath.mit.edu/~gigliola/\nGigliola Staffilani (born March 24, 1966)[1] is an Italian-American[2][3] mathematician who works as the Abby Rockefeller Mauze Professor of Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[4][5][2] Her research concerns harmonic analysis and partial differential equations, including the Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation and Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nContents\n\n1 Education and career\n2 Collaboration\n3 Awards and honors\n4 Major publications\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEducation and career[edit]\nStaffilani grew up on a farm in Martinsicuro in central Italy, speaking only the local dialect, and with no books until her older brother brought some back from his school.
