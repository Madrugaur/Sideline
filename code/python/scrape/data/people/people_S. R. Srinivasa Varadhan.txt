{"name": "S. R. Srinivasa Varadhan", "content": "\n Sathamangalam Ranga Iyengar Srinivasa Varadhan FRS (born 2 January 1940) is an Indian American mathematician who is known for his fundamental contributions to probability theory and in particular for creating a unified theory of large deviations.[1]\n Srinivasa was born in Chennai (then Madras) in 1940.[2] Varadhan received his under-graduate degree in 1959 from Presidency College, Madras, and then moved to the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata. \nIn 1953, His Family Migrated to Kolkata. Then he went back to Chennai for college in 1958.Then in 1960, he went to Kolkata for college. He Grew up in Chennai and Kolkata. After college, He went back to Chennai\nHe was one of the \"famous four\" (the others were R Ranga Rao, K R Parthasarathy, and Veeravalli S Varadarajan) in ISI during 1956\u20131963.[3] He received his doctorate from ISI in 1963 under C R Rao,[4][5] who arranged for Andrey Kolmogorov to be present at Varadhan's thesis defence.[6]\n Since 1963, he has worked at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, where he was at first a postdoctoral fellow (1963\u201366), strongly recommended by Monroe D Donsker. Here he met Daniel Stroock, who became a close colleague and co-author. In an article in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society, Stroock recalls these early years:\n Varadhan, whom everyone calls Raghu, came to these shores from his native India in the fall of 1963. He arrived by plane at Idlewild Airport and proceeded to Manhattan by bus. His destination was that famous institution with the modest name, The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, where he had been given a postdoctoral fellowship. Varadhan was assigned to one of the many windowless offices in the Courant building, which used to be a hat factory. Yet despite the somewhat humble surroundings, from these offices flowed a remarkably large fraction of the post-war mathematics of which America is justly proud. Varadhan is currently a professor at the Courant Institute.[7][8] He is known for his work with Daniel W Stroock on diffusion processes, and for his work on large deviations with Monroe D Donsker. He has chaired the Mathematical Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize from 2009 and was the chief guest in 2020.[9]\n Varadhan's awards and honours include the National Medal of Science (2010) from President Barack Obama, \"the highest honour bestowed by the United States government on scientists, engineers and inventors\".[10] He received also the Birkhoff Prize (1994), the Margaret and Herman Sokol Award of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, New York University (1995), and the Leroy P Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research (1996) from the American Mathematical Society, awarded for his work with Daniel W Stroock on diffusion processes.[11] He was awarded the Abel Prize in 2007 for his work on large deviations with Monroe D Donsker.[7][12] In 2008, the Government of India awarded him the Padma Bhushan.[13] He also has two honorary degrees from Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris (2003) and from Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata, India (2004).\n Varadhan is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences (1995),[14] and the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (2009).[15] He was elected to Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1988),[16] the Third World Academy of Sciences (1988), the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (1991), the Royal Society (1998),[17] the Indian Academy of Sciences (2004), the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (2009),[18] and the American Mathematical Society (2012).[19]\n ", "tags": ["Abel Prize laureates", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Foreign Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy", "Indian emigrants to the United States", "American mathematicians", "20th-century Indian mathematicians", "21st-century Indian mathematicians", "Indian statisticians", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences faculty", "Presidency College, Chennai alumni", "University of Madras alumni", "Living people", "Probability theorists", "1940 births", "American people of Tamil descent", "Recipients of the Padma Bhushan in literature & education", "Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Members of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters", "National Medal of Science laureates", "Presidents of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics", "Indian Statistical Institute alumni", "American academics of Indian descent", "Scientists from Chennai", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 Norwegian-language sources (no)", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "EngvarB from July 2017", "Use dmy dates from July 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Indian American mathematician\n\n\nSrinivasa\nVaradhanSrinivasa Varadhan at the 1st Heidelberg Laureate Forum in September 2013Born (1940-01-02) 2 January 1940 (age\u00a081)Madras, Madras Presidency, British IndiaAlma\u00a0materPresidency college chennaiUniversity of MadrasIndian Statistical InstituteKnown\u00a0forMartingale problems; Large deviation theoryAwardsNational Medal of Science (2010)Padma Bhushan (2008)Abel Prize (2007)Steele Prize (1996)Birkhoff Prize (1994)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsCourant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (New York University)Doctoral advisorC R RaoDoctoral studentsPeter FrizJeremy Quastel\n\nSathamangalam Ranga Iyengar Srinivasa Varadhan FRS (born 2 January 1940) is an Indian American mathematician who is known for his fundamental contributions to probability theory and in particular for creating a unified theory of large deviations.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Awards and honours\n4 Selected publications\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nSrinivasa was born in Chennai (then Madras) in 1940.[2] Varadhan received his under-graduate degree in 1959 from Presidency College, Madras, and then moved to the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata. \nIn 1953, His Family Migrated to Kolkata.
