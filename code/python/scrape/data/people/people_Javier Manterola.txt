{"name": "Javier Manterola", "content": "Javier Manterola Armis\u00e9n (born 1936, Pamplona) is a Spanish civil engineer and professor at the Escuela Superior de Ingenieros de Madrid. Manterola is particularly known for his work as a bridge designer of the engineering firm Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Casado. Author of numerous and varied projects, in collaboration with different Spanish architects as Rafael Moneo, has won over his professional career several awards such as the Premio Pr\u00edncipe de Viana de la Cultura\u00a0[Wikidata]. He is a member of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando.\n Probably, his best known work is the Puente de La Pepa, currently under construction. This bridge is expected to become the main access to the city of C\u00e1diz. Another of his most important designs is the Engineer Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Casado bridge in the AP-66 which spans a part of the Barrios de Luna reservoir in Le\u00f3n, which was a world record for a decade in several categories and still is the longest span in Spain. Author of many bridges in Zaragoza, Manterola designed the Manuel Gim\u00e9nez Abad Bridge for Zaragoza's third ring road (Z-30) and the Barranco de la Muerte aqueduct, structure for the Canal Imperial de Arag\u00f3n to span the previously mentioned Z-30. For the Expo 2008, Manterola designed a pedestrian bridge called Pasarela del Voluntariado. Another of his designs is the bridge on the Ebro for the Spanish high speed railway line Madrid-Barcelona. It is also the author of Puente de Andaluc\u00eda on the Guadalquivir in C\u00f3rdoba and Puente de las Delicias in Sevilla. In Vizcaya, Manterola is the author of the Bridge Euskalduna on the Estuary of Bilbao and several bridges for the Supersur motorway.\n Manterola has also participated in numerous restoration projects of historic bridges, like the Puente Nuevo in Murcia (2001\u20132003) in which a city bridge closed to traffic due to structural reasons was transformed into a pedestrian bridge retaining the original structure during the restoration.[1]\n ", "tags": ["1936 births", "Living people", "Spanish bridge engineers", "Spanish civil engineers", "People from Pamplona", "Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando alumni", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " Pr\u00edncep de Viana bridge in Lleida.\nJavier Manterola Armis\u00e9n (born 1936, Pamplona) is a Spanish civil engineer and professor at the Escuela Superior de Ingenieros de Madrid.
