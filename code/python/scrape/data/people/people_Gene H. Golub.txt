{"name": "Gene H. Golub", "content": "Gene Howard Golub (February 29, 1932 \u2013 November 16, 2007), Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science (and, by courtesy, of Electrical Engineering) at Stanford University, was one of the preeminent numerical analysts of his generation.\n Born in Chicago, he was educated at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, receiving his B.S. (1953), M.A. (1954) and Ph.D. (1959) all in mathematics.[1] His M.A. degree was more specifically in Mathematical Statistics. His PhD dissertation was entitled \"The Use of Chebyshev Matrix Polynomials in the Iterative Solution of Linear Equations Compared to the Method of Successive Overrelaxation\" and his thesis adviser was Abraham Taub. Gene Golub succumbed to acute myeloid leukemia on the morning of 16 November 2007 at the Stanford Hospital.[2]\n He arrived at Stanford in 1962 and became a professor there in 1970. He advised more than thirty doctoral students, many of whom have themselves achieved distinction. Gene Golub was an important figure in numerical analysis and pivotal to creating the NA-Net and the NA-Digest, as well as the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics.[3]\n One of his best-known books is Matrix Computations,[4]\nco-authored with Charles F. Van Loan. He was a major contributor to algorithms for matrix decompositions. In particular he published an algorithm together with William Kahan in 1970 that made the computation of the singular value decomposition (SVD) feasible and that is still used today. A survey of his work was published in 2007 by Oxford University Press as \"Milestones in Matrix Computation\".[5]\n Golub was awarded the B. Bolzano Gold Medal for Merits in the Field of Mathematical Sciences and was one of the few elected to three national academies: the National Academy of Sciences (1993), the National Academy of Engineering (1990), and the  American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1994). He was also a Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences (1986).\n He is listed as an ISI highly cited researcher.[6] He held 11 honorary doctorates and was scheduled to receive an honorary doctorate from ETH Z\u00fcrich on November 17, 2007. He was a visiting professor at Princeton (1970), MIT (1979), ETH (1974 & 2002), and Oxford (1982, 1998 & 2007).\n Gene Golub served as the president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) from 1985 to 1987 and was founding editor of both the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing (SISC) and the SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications (SIMAX).\n The bulk of Gene Golub's research work was collaborative.  He had at least 181 distinct co-authors[7]\nand the number may still increase as co-authored papers keep appearing posthumously.\n ", "tags": ["Numerical analysts", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Jewish American scientists", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences", "Deaths from leukemia", "Singular value decomposition", "Stanford University School of Engineering faculty", "University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign alumni", "Deaths from cancer in California", "Highly Cited Researchers", "1932 births", "2007 deaths", "Presidents of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from January 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nGene H.
