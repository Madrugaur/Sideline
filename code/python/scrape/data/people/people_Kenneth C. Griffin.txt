He is the founder, chief executive officer, Co-chief investment officer, and 85% owner of Citadel LLC,[3][4] which had $38 billion of assets under management as of March 2021.[5] Citadel Securities, a market maker, handles 40% of the stock trades in the United States.[6][7]\n Frequently one of the highest earning hedge fund managers, earning in excess of $1 billion per year, Griffin has an estimated net worth of either US$16 billion[1] or US$22.4 billion[2], making him the 2nd richest person in Illinois and the 45th richest person in America.[1][8]\n Griffin has contributed tens of millions of dollars to political candidates and causes, primarily those of the Republican Party. He owns an art collection valued at $800 million and personal residences valued in total at over $1 billion. His purchases of residences in London and New York City, for $122 million and $238 million, respectively, broke records for the highest prices paid for residences in those cities. He guards his private life and often buys the rights to photos of him to keep them out of circulation. His divorce with Anne Dias-Griffin in 2015 was highly publicized.\n Griffin is known for his incendiary temper and aggressive personality, which has resulted in turnover at Citadel.[9]\n Griffin was born in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida, the son of a building supplies executive.[10] Griffin's father was a project manager for General Electric.[11] Griffin's grandmother, Genevieve Huebsch Gratz, inherited an oil business, three farms, and a seed business.[12]\n Griffin grew up in Boca Raton, Florida, with some time in Texas, and Wisconsin.[13] He went to middle school in Boca Raton[11] followed by Boca Raton Community High School, where he was the president of the math club.[13][14] In high school, Griffin ran a discount mail-order education software firm out of his bedroom called EDCOM.[14] In a 1986 article in the Sun-Sentinel, Griffin stated that he thinks he will become a businessman or lawyer and that he believes the job market for computer programmers will significantly decrease over the coming decade.[14]\n Griffin started at Harvard College in the fall of 1986.[13] That year, one of his first investments was to buy put options on Home Shopping Network, making a $5,000 profit.[15] He also invested in convertible arbitrage opportunities in convertible bonds, convertible into stock.[13] Despite a ban on running businesses from campus, Griffin convinced school administrators to allow him to install a satellite dish on the roof of the Cabot House dormitory to receive stock quotes.[15][13] He also asked Terrence J. O\u2019Connor, the manager of convertible bonds at Merrill Lynch in Boston, to open a brokerage account for him with $100,000 that Griffin had gotten from his grandmother, his dentist, and others.[11][13] His first fund launched in 1987 with $265,000, days after his 19th birthday.[13] The fund launched in time to profit from short positions on Black Monday (1987).[13] Griffin graduated in 1989 with a degree in economics.[16]\n After graduating in 1989, Griffin moved to Chicago to work with Frank Meyer, founder of Glenwood Capital Investments.[17] Meyer allotted $1 million of Glenwood capital for Griffin to trade[17] and Griffin made 70% in a year.[13]\n A year later, in 1990, Griffin founded Citadel LLC, with assets under management of $4.6 million, aided by contributions from Meyer.[17] His funds made 43% in 1991 and 40% in 1992.[15]\n In 2003, aged 34, Griffin was the youngest self-made individual on the Forbes 400 with an estimated net worth of $650 million.[18]\n From the time of his marriage in 2003 until late 2009, Griffin was the lead investor in Aragon Global Management, a hedge fund run by his then-wife Anne Dias-Griffin. The fund was also seeded with money from Julian Robertson. Ken lost 20% of his investment in the fund.[19]\n In 2006, Citadel acquired the positions of Amaranth Advisors at a steep discount.[13]\n During the financial crisis of 2007-2008, for 10 months, Griffin barred his investors from withdrawing money, attracting criticism.[4][20] At the peak of the crisis, the firm was losing \"hundreds of millions of dollars each week\".[21] It was leveraged 7:1 and the biggest funds at Citadel finished 2008 down 55%. However, they rebounded with a 62% return in 2009.[13]\n In 2008, Griffin's Citadel indirectly received $200 million in U.S. taxpayer money as a result of the American International Group bailout.[22][23]\n From Citadel LLC, Griffin earned $900 million in 2009,[24] $1.4 billion in 2014[25] $600 million in 2016,[26] $1.4 billion in 2017,[27][28] $870 million in 2018,[29] $1.5 billion in 2019,[30] and $1.8 billion in 2020.[31]\n In November 2020, according to Bloomberg News Griffin's net worth surpassed $20 billion due to an increase the value of Citadel, of which Griffin's stake was worth $11.2 billion.[3] Citadel Securities, a market maker, increased its profit to $2.36 billion during the first half of 2020 compared to $982 million for the same period in 2019 due to increased volatility, volume and retail trader engagement.[32][33]\n In January 2021, Griffin attracted criticism for the role played by Citadel in the GameStop short squeeze.[34] On January 25, it was announced that Griffin's Citadel would invest $2 billion into Melvin Capital, which had suffered losses of more than 30% on account of its short positions, particularly on GameStop.[35][36][37] On January 28, Robinhood, an electronic trading platform favored by many traders involved in buying GameStop stock and options, abruptly announced that it would halt all purchases of GameStop securities except to cover shorts and would only allow these securities to be sold if already held (but not sold short); the price of GME stock declined steeply shortly thereafter.[38] Because Robinhood receives a substantial portion of its revenue through a payment for order flow relationship with Citadel Securities LLC, 85% of which is owned by Griffin, many commentators criticized the potential for a conflict of interest when the same entity both plays the role of market-maker and also participates in the market that it makes; Griffin personally has been at the center of much discussion on this controversy.[39][40][41][42][43] On February 18, 2021, Griffin testified before the House Financial Services Committee to address his role in the GameStop controversy;[43][44] Griffin has donated money directly to four congresspeople on the committee, including Republicans French Hill, Andy Barr, Ann Wagner, and Bill Huizenga.[43]\n In 2012, Griffin identified as a Reagan Republican in an interview with the Chicago Tribune. He said the belief \"that a larger government is what creates prosperity, that a larger government is what creates good\" is wrong.[45]\n In April 2016, because Citadel owned over 1 million shares of McDonald's, Griffin was the target of protestors supporting the Fight for $15.[46]\n During an interview with David Rubenstein Griffin criticized Elizabeth Warren's proposals saying \"soaking the rich doesn't work\".[47] Griffin has been criticized by Elizabeth Warren for his real estate purchases.[48]\n In September 2020, Griffin wrote an op-ed published in the Chicago Tribune stating his opposition to Governor of Illinois J. B. Pritzker's \"Fair Tax\" proposal that would change Illinois income tax from a flat tax to a graduated tax.[49][50]\n In an October 2020 email to Citadel LLC's Chicago employees, Griffin criticized Pritzker's tax plan and alluded to the possibility of moving his company out of Illinois.[51][52]\n In October 2017, Griffin's charitable fund donated $1 million to the Obama Foundation.[53][54]\n Griffin did not attend a signing ceremony for the phase-one trade deal with China at the White House, for which he was criticized by President Donald Trump.[55][56][57][58]\n Griffin criticized Donald Trump's tweets berating Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell calling the tweets \"completely inappropriate for the president of the United States\".[59][60][61][57]\n While being interviewed by Paul Tudor Jones at the Robin Hood Foundation investor conference in October 2020, Griffin criticized Joe Biden's plans to raise the long-term capital gains tax rate.[62][63]\n In a 2012 interview, Griffin said that people should be able to make unlimited contributions to politicians, but that these contributions should be public.[64]\n During the 2010 United States elections, Griffin donated $721,600 to federal candidates and political committees. Except for a $2,400 contribution to then United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Chairman Chris Dodd, all of the contributions were to Republicans.[65]\n Griffin has made political donations to conservative political candidates, parties, and organizations such as American Crossroads and the Republican Governors Association.[64]\n In 2015, Griffin donated $5.855 million to Conservative Solutions Project, Freedom Partners Action Fund, Right to Rise, and Future45.[66]\n In December 2015, Griffin endorsed Marco Rubio for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and stated that he planned to donate millions to a pro-Rubio super PAC.[67] Before this endorsement, Griffin had donated $100,000 each to three super PACs supporting Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker for the GOP nomination.[68]\n In March 2020, Griffin contributed $1 million to the 1820 PAC created to support the re-election bid of U. S. Senator Susan Collins in Maine.[69] In late 2020, Griffin donated another $500,000 to the 1820 PAC.[70]\n Griffin supported Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in the 2020\u201321 United States Senate election in Georgia.[71] In October 2020, He was criticized for a $2 million contribution to a Super PAC supporting Loeffler and funded by her husband, New York Stock Exchange Chairman Jeffrey Sprecher, just after one of Citadel LLC's companies needed approval from Sprecher for a merger.[72]\n \nGriffin has individually supported many candidates including:[74] In 2020, Griffin donated $20 million to the Coalition To Stop The Proposed Tax Hike Amendment, a group opposing the Illinois Fair Tax in its 2020 referendum.[50][75] Weeks later, he donated another $26.75 million to the coalition.[76][77] Griffin later donated another $7 million to the group bringing his total contributions to $53.75 million.[78][79]\n In 2020, Griffin donated $2 million to an anti-retention effort for Justice Thomas L. Kilbride, a democrat on the Supreme Court of Illinois.[80][81]\n In October 2009, Griffin and his wife founded the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation. The foundation is particularly focused on donations to public education and libraries.[10]\n The Griffins have previously worked with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in the promotion of charter schools in the US.[13] The couple have worked with University of Chicago economics professor John A. List to test whether investment in teachers or in parents produces better student performance outcomes.[82]\n At the beginning of 2014, Griffin made a $150 million donation to the financial aid program at Harvard University, his alma mater, the largest single donation ever made to the institution at the time.[83]\n In 2014, he was elected to a five-year term on the University of Chicago's board of trustees.

The space was \"raw space\" meaning Griffin had to build it out.[109][117][118][119][120] Several New York real estate experts have said that the purchase helped fuel legislation that increased taxes on luxury homes in New York.[109][121][122][123] During an interview with David Rubenstein Griffin said that the purchase represented the possibility of making New York City his home in the future.[124]\n In 2009 Griffin purchased a full floor apartment at 820 Fifth Avenue in New York City for $40 million.[109][125][126]\n In 2015 Griffin purchased two apartments at the top of the Faena House, a condominium in Miami Beach for $60 million.
