In 1943, he was drafted into the army. After demobilisation in 1946, he studied at Kharkov University, graduating in 1950. After several years in Makeevka he returned to Kharkov in 1957, where he spent the remainder of his life working at various institutes. He defended his PhD in 1955 (under the supervision of Boris Levin), and his doctoral dissertation in 1963.  He was awarded the State Prize of Ukraine in 2005.\n After reading the Ukrainian translation of Banach's monograph Th\u00e9orie des op\u00e9rations lin\u00e9aires,[4] he became interested in the theory of Banach spaces.[5] In 1966, Kadets solved in the affirmative the Banach\u2013Fr\u00e9chet problem, asking whether every two separable infinite-dimensional  Banach spaces are homeomorphic. He developed the method of equivalent norms, which has found numerous applications. For example, he showed that every separable Banach space admits an equivalent Fr\u00e9chet differentiable norm if and only if the dual space is separable.[6]\n Together with Aleksander Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski, he obtained important results on the topological structure of Lp spaces.[7]\n Kadets also made several contributions to the theory of finite-dimensional normed spaces. Together with M.\u00a0G.\u00a0Snobar (1971), he showed that every n-dimensional subspace of a Banach space is the image of a projection of norm at most \u221an.[8] Together with V.\u00a0I.\u00a0Gurarii and V.\u00a0I.\u00a0Matsaev, he found the exact order of magnitude of the Banach\u2013Mazur distance between the n-dimensional spaces \u2113np and \u2113nq.[9]\n In harmonic analysis, Kadets proved (1964) what is now called the Kadets\u00a0\u200b1\u20444 theorem, which states that, if |\u03bbn\u00a0\u2212\u00a0n|\u00a0\u2264\u00a0C\u00a0<\u00a0\u200b1\u20444 for all integer n, then the sequence (exp(i\u03bbnx))n\u00a0\u2208\u00a0Z is a Riesz basis in L2[-\u03c0,\u00a0\u03c0].[10]\n Kadets was the founder of the Kharkov school of Banach spaces.[6]\nTogether with his son Vladimir Kadets, he authored two books about series in Banach spaces.[11]\n ", "tags": ["Functional analysts", "Mathematical analysts", "National University of Kharkiv alumni", "1923 births", "2011 deaths", "CS1 Russian-language sources (ru)", "CS1 Ukrainian-language sources (uk)", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Articles containing Ukrainian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Mikhail KadetsBorn(1923-11-30)30 November 1923KievDied7 March 2011(2011-03-07) (aged\u00a087)KharkovCitizenshipUkraineAlma\u00a0materKharkov UniversityKnown\u00a0forBanach\u2013Fr\u00e9chet problemKadets\u00a0\u200b1\u20444-theoremKadets\u2013Snobar estimateScientific careerFieldsBanach spaces  harmonic analysisDoctoral advisorBoris Levin\n\nMikhail\u00a0Iosiphovich Kadets (Russian: \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0418\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0444\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0446, Ukrainian: \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e \u0419\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0446\u044c,  sometimes transliterated as Kadec, 30 November 1923 \u2013 7 March 2011) was a Soviet-born Jewish mathematician working in analysis and the theory of Banach spaces.[1][2][3]\n\nLife and work[edit]\nKadets was born in Kiev.
