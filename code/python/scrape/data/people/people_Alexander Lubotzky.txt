In 2018 he won the Israel Prize for his accomplishments in maths and computer science.\n Alexander (Alex) Lubotzky was born in Tel Aviv to Holocaust survivors. His father, Iser Lubotzky was a Partisan, Irgun officer and the legal advisor of Herut. After school, Lubotzky did his IDF national service as a captain officer in a special intelligence and communication unit. He studied mathematics at Bar-Ilan University during highschool, gaining a BA (summa cum laude) and continued to direct PhD under the supervision of Professor Hillel Furstenberg.\n Lubotzky married Yardenna (daughter of Murray Roston), a lecturer in Art History and English, in 1980. The couple had six children; the oldest, Asael Lubotzky, was injured severely in the Battle of Bint Jbeil in Lebanon, while serving as an officer in the IDF in the 2006 Lebanon war and after his rehabilitation became a physician.[2]\n He worked as a professor of mathematics at the Hebrew University, becoming head of the department (1994\u20131996). He has been a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, Stanford, and the University of Chicago, with visits at Columbia, Yale, NYU and ETH Zurich.\nLubotzky holds a Maurice and Clara Weil Chair in mathematics at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is known for contributions to geometric group theory, the study of lattices in Lie groups, representation theory of discrete groups and Kazhdan's property (T), the study of subgroup growth and applications of group theory to combinatorics and computer science (expander graphs) and error correcting codes.\n Lubotzky received the Erd\u0151s Prize in 1990.[3] in the years 1994\u20131996 Lubotzky was the chairman of Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n In 1992 Lubotzky was a recipient of the Sunyer i Balaguer Prize from the Institut d'Estudis Catalans for his book \"Discrete Groups Expanding Graphs and Invariant Measures\" and again in 2002 with Dan Segal for their book \"Subgroup Growth\".[4] In 2002 he has received the Rothschild Prize in mathematics.[5] Lubotzky  is listed as an ISI highly cited researcher in mathematics since 2003.\n Lubotzky was elected a foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005.[6] In 2005-6 He led in the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton a year long program on \"Pro-finite groups and the congruence subgroup problem\". In 2006, he got an honorary degree from the University of Chicago for his contribution to Modern mathematics.[7]\n In 2008 Lubotzky received the European Research Council (ERC) advanced grant for exceptional established research leaders.[8] In 2011 Lubotzky was chosen to be the keynote speaker at the joint meeting of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) in New Orleans. Lubotzky's keynote address in front of the conference's 6,000 attendees marked the first time that an Israeli was the keynote speaker at one of these conferences.[9] In 2012 he was a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research Center.\n A founding member of The Third Way in March 1996, he chaired its secretariat and was elected to the Knesset in the May 1996 elections. He served as a member of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee; Constitution, Law and Justice Committee; Status of Women Committee and the Science and Technology Committee, and chaired the subcommittee on the Y2K Bug.\n As an MK, Prof. Lubotzky was mainly known for his compromise proposals on religious issues and pluralism. He was actively involved in setting up a solution to the conversion bill crisis via the Ne'eman Commission, working to avoid a conflict between Israel and the Jewish Diaspora. Prof. Lubotzky also co-drafted a comprehensive proposal for a new covenant for religion-state affairs in Israel with MK Yossi Beilin.\n In 2014, he was elected to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities.[10] In 2015 Lubotzky received the European Research Council (ERC) advanced grant for exceptional established research leaders,[11] becoming one of the only researchers receiving the grant twice.\n In honor of Lubotzky's sixtieth birthday The Israel Institute for Advanced Studies hosted a conference (Midrasha) from 5 November through 11 November 2016, with scholars from around the world convening to celebrate his work, impact, and collaborations.[12]\n In 2018 Lubotzky received the Israel Prize, for mathematics.[13] Lubotzky gave a Plenary lecture in the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.[14] In 2021 Lubotzky received the European Research Council (ERC) advanced grant for exceptional established research leaders, becoming the only researcher receiving the advanced grant three times.In 2014, he was elected to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities.[15] In 2015 Lubotzky received the European Research Council (ERC) advanced grant for exceptional established research leaders,[16] becoming one of the only researchers receiving the grant twice.\n In 2018 Lubotzky received the Israel Prize, for mathematics.[17] Lubotzky gave a Plenary lecture in the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.[18] In 2021 Lubotzky received the European Research Council (ERC) advanced grant for exceptional established research leaders, becoming the only researcher receiving the advanced grant three times.\n ", "tags": ["1956 births", "People from Tel Aviv", "20th-century mathematicians", "21st-century mathematicians", "Bar-Ilan University alumni", "Israeli mathematicians", "Israeli scientists", "Jewish scientists", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Members of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "Israel Prize in mathematics recipients", "Israeli Orthodox Jews", "Living people", "Third Way (Israel) politicians", "Centre Party (Israel) politicians", "Jewish Israeli politicians", "Israeli settlers", "Members of the 14th Knesset (1996\u20131999)", "Yale University faculty", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Use dmy dates from August 2018", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Not to be confused with Alexander Lubotsky.\n\n\nAlexander LubotzkyFaction represented in the Knesset1996\u20131999The Third Way\nPersonal detailsBorn (1956-06-28) 28 June 1956 (age\u00a064)Tel Aviv, IsraelSpouse(s)Yardenna LubotzkyChildrensix living offspring: \nAsael LubotzkyAlma\u00a0materBar Ilan UniversityKnown\u00a0forGeometric group theory, the study of lattices in Lie groups, representation theory of discrete groups and Kazhdan's property (T), the study of subgroup growth and applications of group theory to combinatorics and computer science (expander graphs) and error correcting codesAwardsLandau Award (1979); Bergman Memorial Prize (1980\u20131); Erd\u0151s Prize (1990); Sunyer i Balaguer Prize (1992,2002); Rothschild Prize (2002); ISI highly cited researcher (2003); Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2005); Honorary degree from the University of Chicago (2006); The Rector's Prize of the Hebrew University (2007); European Research Council (ERC) advanced grant (2008); Member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (2014); European Research Council (ERC) advanced grant (2015);Israel Prize (2018)  European Research Council (ERC) advanced grant (2021)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsHebrew University, Stanford, University of Chicago, Columbia, Yale, Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NYU, ETH ZurichThesisPro-finite groups and the congruence subgroup problem\u00a0(1979)Doctoral advisorHillel Furstenberg\n\nAlexander Lubotzky (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05dc\u05db\u05e1\u05e0\u05d3\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05e6\u05e7\u05d9\u200e, born 28 June 1956) is an Israeli mathematician and former politician who is currently a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and an adjunct professor at Yale University.[1] He served as a member of the Knesset for The Third Way party between 1996 and 1999.
