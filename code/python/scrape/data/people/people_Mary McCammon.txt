N. de G. Allen.[1][4][5]\n She joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology for postdoctoral research.[3] McCammon joined Pennsylvania State University in 1954.[3] She introduced classes in numerical analysis, calculus and computer programming.[6] She served as director for undergraduate studies twice, first between 1963 and 1975, and again from 1988 to 1998.[3] McCammon was promoted to Professor in 1992.[3] She created the first mathematics placement test, which were given to all freshmen.[7][8]\n In 2000, Pennsylvania State University announced the Mary Lister McCammon Award, a scholarship for undergraduate studies, as well as the McCammon Award for Distinguished Undergraduate Teaching named in her honour.[13][14] In 2019, Imperial College London announced the Mary Lister McCammon Summer Research Fellowship for undergraduate women mathematicians.[4]\n ", "tags": ["2008 deaths", "Women mathematicians", "British women mathematicians", "Pennsylvania State University alumni", "Alumni of the University of London", "Alumni of Imperial College London", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Year of birth uncertain"], "raw": "British mathematician\nMary Lister McCammonBornMary ListerAlma\u00a0materUniversity of London (BSc, MSc) Imperial College London (PhD)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsPennsylvania State University  Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyThesisThe relaxation method applied to the solution of problems of viscous flow\u00a0(1953)Doctoral advisorD.
