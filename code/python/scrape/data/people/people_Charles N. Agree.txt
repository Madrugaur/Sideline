He opened his firm in 1917 after graduating from the Detroit Y.M.C.A. Technical School.[1] His first major commission was in 1921 to build the Whittier Hotel near the bank of the Detroit River.

Agree was one of the Detroit architects of the 1920s and 1930s who utilized the services of architectural sculptor Corrado Parducci.\n As the architecture changed by the 1960s, so did Agree's commissions. He began designing many modern-style malls.

These include the Vanity Ballroom, where several Mayan-Deco panels were torn off, and the Grande Ballroom, which brought rock band MC5 into fame, which has sat empty since closing in 1972.\n ", "tags": ["Charles N.
