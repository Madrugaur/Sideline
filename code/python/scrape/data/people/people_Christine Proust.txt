{"name": "Christine Proust", "content": "\nChristine Proust (born 1953)[1] is a French historian of mathematics and Assyriologist known for her research on Babylonian mathematics. She is a senior researcher at the SPHERE joint team of CNRS and Paris Diderot University, where she and Agathe Keller (who studies mathematical Sanskrit texts) are co-directors of the SAW project (Mathematical Sciences in the Ancient World) headed by Karine Chemla (an expert in ancient Chinese mathematics).[2][3]\n Following a two-decade long career as a secondary mathematics teacher, including an agr\u00e9gation in Mathematics in 1992, Proust  studied epistemology and history of science at Paris Diderot University, earning a dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes approfondies in 1999 and a doctorate in 2004,[3] supervised by Christian Houzel\u00a0[fr].[4] She completed a habilitation at Paris Diderot in 2010,[3] and became a director of research in the SPHERE laboratory in 2011.[5]\n Proust was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton during 2009,[6] a visiting scholar at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University during 2010,[7] and a resident at the Institut M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en de Recherches Avanc\u00e9es in Marseille during 2010\u20132011.[8]\n In her thesis work, Proust edited and analyzed two long-neglected collections of Old Babylonian mathematical tablets that constitute part of the vast trove of artifacts excavated at Nippur by John Punnett Peters, John Henry Haynes and Hermann Hilprecht in the late 1800s.[9][10]  This work resulted in the publication of two books, 'Tablettes math\u00e9matiques de Nippur' and 'Tablettes math\u00e9matiques de la collection Hilprecht'.[11][12]\nThe first is an edition of the tablets housed at the Museum of the Ancient Orient in Istanbul and an improved reconstruction of the curriculum for elementary scribal education in mathematics at Old Babylonian Nippur, the second an edition of the tablets housed in the Hilprecht Collection at the University of Jena.  (Other Nippur tablets at the University of Pennsylvania and had been previously studied by Eleanor Robson.)  \n Proust's work produced the most detailed reconstruction of the process of elementary scribal education at Old Babylonian Nippur, including the curriculum and timelines, the interaction of education in Sumerian language and mathematics (Sumerian was a foreign language to the Akkadian speakers of the Old Babylonian era), and the interaction between metrological calculation and abstract calculation using sexagesimal place-value notation.\n With Alexander Jones she curated the exhibit Before Pythagoras: The Culture of Old Babylonian Mathematics (2010\u20132011) at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) in New York in which a number of mathematically important clay tablets, including YBC 7289 and Plimpton 322 were on display.[4]  Proust has also been involved in study of the papers and correspondence of the noted historian Otto Neugebauer, who largely initiated the study of mathematical cuneiform texts in the mid-twentieth century.  Some of this material was on display at the ISAW exhibit\n Proust is the author of Tablettes math\u00e9matiques de Nippur (De Boccard, 2007)[10] and of Tablettes math\u00e9matiques de la collection Hilprecht (Harrassowitz, 2008).[9]\n She is the editor of books including:\n Proust was the 2011 winner of the Prix Paul Doistau-\u00c9mile Blutet de l'information scientifique\u00a0[fr], given by the French Academy of Sciences in recognition of the body of her work and, in particular, for her publication of the Nippur tablets.[5]  She became a corresponding member of the International Academy of the History of Science in 2019.[15]\n ", "tags": ["1953 births", "Living people", "French historians", "French women historians", "French mathematicians", "French women mathematicians", "French Assyriologists", "Historians of mathematics", "Paris Diderot University alumni", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "CS1 maint: untitled periodical", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from September 2020", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French mathematician and historian of mathematics\n\nChristine Proust (born 1953)[1] is a French historian of mathematics and Assyriologist known for her research on Babylonian mathematics.
