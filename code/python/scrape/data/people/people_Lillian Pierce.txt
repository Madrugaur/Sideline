Stein,  her interests shifted towards pure mathematics.[1][8][5] As an undergraduate, she also became an intern at the National Security Agency.[1]\nShe was Princeton's 2002 valedictorian and became a Rhodes Scholar, repeating two accomplishments of her brother Niles Pierce from nine years earlier.[5]\n She earned a master's degree at the University of Oxford in 2004.[4][1] Returning to Princeton for doctoral study in mathematics, she completed her Ph.D. in 2009.
