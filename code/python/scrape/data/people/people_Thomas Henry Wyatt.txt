His father was Matthew Wyatt (1773\u20131831) a barrister and police magistrate for Roscommon and Lambeth. Wyatt is presumed to have moved to Lambeth with his father in 1825 and then initially embarked on a career as a merchant sailing to the Mediterranean, particularly Malta.\n He married his first cousin Arabella Montagu Wyatt (1807\u20131875).
