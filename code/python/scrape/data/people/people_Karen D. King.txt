She was selected for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) Scholars Program at Spelman College as an undergraduate and finished her degree in mathematics magna cum Laude in 3 years. King next attended University of Maryland with a National Science Foundation fellowship and earned her Ph.D. in Mathematics Education in 1997. Her dissertation advisor was Patricia F. Campbell.[1]\n King began her career as an assistant professor at San Diego State University in 1997. In 1999 she moved to Michigan State University. In 2006 King relocated to New York University as an associate professor. While a professor, King focused her research and publications on urban mathematics reform, the mathematical preparation of K-12 teachers, and mathematics professional development policies.[2] King became the Director of Research for National Council of Teachers of Mathematics in 2011 where she co-authored the book Disrupting Tradition: Research and Practice in Mathematics.[3] She later became a program director at the National Science Foundation of Education and Human Resources. In 2012 she was honored as an AWM/MAA Falconer Lecturer[4] and served on the writing team that wrote The Mathematical Education of Teachers II.[5] King also served as an associate editor for the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education from 2001 to 2004 and was a member of the Mathematics Association of America for nineteen years.[6][7]\n King's work earned her recognition by Mathematically Gifted & Black, where she was featured as a Black History Month 2020 Honoree.[1]\n Co-Author\n Contributor\n Book Chapter\n ", "tags": ["20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "African-American mathematicians", "African-American women academics", "University of Maryland Eastern Shore alumni", "National Science Foundation", "1971 births", "2019 deaths", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "American mathematics educator\nKaren D KingNationalityAmericanTitleProgram DirectorAwardsAWM/MAA Falconer LecturerAcademic backgroundAlma materUniversity of MarylandDoctoral advisorPatricia F CampbellAcademic workDisciplineMathematics EducationInstitutionsNational Science FoundationNational Council of Teachers of MathematicsNew York UniversityMichigan State UniversitySan Diego State University\n\nKaren Denise King (July 6, 1971 \u2013 December 24, 2019)[1] was an African-American mathematics educator, a program director at National Science Foundation, and a 2012 AWM/MAA Falconer Lecturer.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Professional career\n3 Publications\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nKaren Denise King was born on July 6, 1971 in Washington, D.C..
