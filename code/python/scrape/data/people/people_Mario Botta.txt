{"name": "Mario Botta", "content": "Mario Botta (born 1 April 1943) is a Swiss architect.\n Botta designed his first building, a two-family house at Morbio Superiore in Ticino, at age 16. He graduated from the Universit\u00e0 Iuav di Venezia (1969).[1] While the arrangements of spaces in this structure is inconsistent, its relationship to its site, separation of living from service spaces, and deep window recesses echo of what would become his stark, strong, towering style. His designs tend to include a strong sense of geometry, often being based on very simple shapes, yet creating unique volumes of space. His buildings are often made of brick, yet his use of material is wide, varied, and often unique.\n His trademark style can be seen widely in Switzerland particularly the Ticino region and also in the Mediatheque in Villeurbanne (1988), a cathedral in \u00c9vry (1995), and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art or SFMOMA (1994). He also designed the Europa-Park Dome, which houses many major events at the Europa-Park theme park resort in Germany. Religious works by Botta, including the Cymbalista Synagogue and Jewish Heritage Center were shown in London at the Royal Institute of British Architects in an exhibition entitled, Architetture del Sacro: Prayers in Stone.[2] \u201cA church is the place, par excellence, of architecture,\u201d he said in an interview with architectural historian Judith Dupr\u00e9. \u201cWhen you enter a church, you already are part of what has transpired and will transpire there. The church is a house that puts a believer in a dimension where he or she is the protagonist.  The sacred directly lives in the collective. Man becomes a participant in a church, even if he never says anything.\u201d[3]\n In 1998, he designed the new bus station for Vimercate (near Milan), a red brick building linked to many facilities, underlining the city's recent development.\nHe worked at La Scala's theatre renovation, which proved controversial as preservationists feared that historic details would be lost. \n In 2004, he designed Museum One of the Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in Seoul, South Korea.[4] On January 1, 2006 he received the Grand Officer award from President of the Italian Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. In 2006 he designed his first ever spa, the Bergoase Spa in Arosa, Switzerland. The spa opened in December 2006 and cost an estimated CHF 35 million.
