{"name": "Walter Bruch", "content": "Walter Bruch (2 March 1908, Neustadt an der Weinstra\u00dfe \u2013 5 May 1990, Hannover) was a German electrical engineer and pioneer of German television. He is the inventor of Closed-circuit television. He invented the PAL colour television system at Telefunken in the early 1960s. In addition to his research activities Walter Bruch was an honorary lecturer at Hannover Technical University. He was awarded the Werner von Siemens Ring in 1975.\n He was born in Neustadt an der Weinstra\u00dfe, German Empire. At his father's request he attended a business school, but then trained as a machinist apprenticeship in a shoe factory. From 1928 he attended the university of applied science Hochschule Mittweida in Saxony. After that, he was a guest student at the Technical University of Berlin, where he met Manfred von Ardenne and the Hungarian inventor D\u00e9nes von Mih\u00e1ly.\n From the early 1930s Bruch was involved in the development of television technology: in 1933 he presented a \"people's television receiver\" with a self-built telecine. In 1935 he started work as a technician in the Television and Physics research Department of Telefunken which was headed by Professor Fritz Schr\u00f6ter\u00a0[de] and where Emil Mechau\u00a0[de] developed a special television camera for the 1936 Summer Olympics. The Summer Olympic Games of 1936 in Berlin became a milestone for audiovisual technology and Bruch was able to field test the first Iconoscope camera, developed by Emil Mechau based on a tube by Walter Heimann\u00a0[de].[1] One year later, at the Paris International Exposition, he introduced an iconoscope television unit that he had designed.[citation needed] During World War II he operated a closed-circuit television system installed at the Peenem\u00fcnde launch site, so that the V-2 rocket launches could be watched at a safe distance from a bunker.[citation needed]\n In 1950 Telefunken commissioned him to develop the first post-war television receivers. Some time later, he returned to physics research and later colour television. He studied and thoroughly tested the American NTSC system and what would later become the French SECAM system. His work led him and co-workers like Gerhard Mahler\u00a0[de] and Dr. Kruse to devise a new colour television system that automatically corrected for the differential phase distortion that can occur along the transmission channel.\n On 3 January 1963 he gave the first public presentation of the Phase Alternation Line System to a group of experts from the European Broadcasting Union in Hannover. This is considered to be the date of birth of the PAL-Telefunken system, which was later adopted by more than thirty countries (at present, more than one hundred). When interviewed by German talk show host Hans Rosenthal on why he had named it the \"PAL system\", Bruch replied that certainly no German would want to have a \"Bruch-System\" had his family name been used as the eponym; Bruch in German is synonymous with \"broken\".\n He received the David Sarnoff Medal from the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers in 1971 and the Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor from the German Eduard Rhein Foundation in 1981.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1908 births", "1990 deaths", "Engineers from Rhineland-Palatinate", "German electronics engineers", "Television pioneers", "German inventors", "Werner von Siemens Ring laureates", "Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art", "People from Neustadt an der Weinstra\u00dfe", "People from the Palatinate (region)", "Knights Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles to be expanded from July 2014", "All articles to be expanded", "Articles needing translation from German Wikipedia", "Articles needing additional references from September 2009", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from April 2013", "Articles with unsourced statements from April 2017", "CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article may be expanded with text translated from the corresponding article in German.
