{"name": "Kenneth Kunen", "content": "Herbert Kenneth Kunen (August 2, 1943\u00a0\u2013 August 14, 2020[1]) was a professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison[2] who worked in set theory and its applications to various areas of mathematics, such as set-theoretic topology and measure theory. He also worked on non-associative algebraic systems, such as loops, and used computer software, such as the Otter theorem prover, to derive theorems in these areas.\n Kunen was born in New York City in 1943 and died in 2020.[1] He lived in Madison, Wisconsin, with his wife Anne, with whom he had two sons, Isaac and Adam.[3]\n Kunen completed his undergraduate degree at the California Institute of Technology[3] and received his Ph.D. in 1968 from Stanford University, where he was supervised by Dana Scott.[4]\n Kunen showed that if there exists a nontrivial elementary embedding j\u00a0:\u00a0L\u00a0\u2192\u00a0L of the constructible universe, then 0# exists.\nHe proved the consistency of a normal, \n\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph _{2}}\n\n-saturated ideal on \n\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph _{1}}\n\n from the consistency of the existence of a huge cardinal.
