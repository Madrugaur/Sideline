Previously he taught at Yale University. He received his Ph.D. from M.I.T. in 1970 where his advisors were Bertram Kostant and Sigurdur Helgason. Lepowsky graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1961,[1] 16 years after Kostant.[2]   His current research is in the areas of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and vertex algebras. He has written several books on vertex algebras and related topics. In 1988, in a joint work with Igor Frenkel and Arne Meurman, he constructed the monster vertex algebra (also known as the Moonshine module). His PhD students include Stefano Capparelli, Yi-Zhi Huang, Haisheng Li, Arne Meurman, and Antun Milas.[3]\n In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[4]\n \n This article about an American mathematician is a stub.
