{"name": "Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk", "content": "Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk (born December 20, 1950) is an American architect and urban planner based in Miami, Florida. She is considered to be a representative of the New Urbanism school of urban planning, and an advocate of the New Classical school of architecture. She is also a co-founder and principal of the firm of Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company (DPZ).[1]\n Elizabeth Maria Plater-Zyberk was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Josaphat Plater-Zyberk (1906\u20131994), an architect, and his wife, Maria Meysztowski (1911\u20132000), a professor of French at Villanova University. Plater-Zyberk is an alumna of Sacred Heart Academy Overbrook,[2] and received her undergraduate degree in architecture and urban planning from Princeton University (1972) and a master's degree in architecture from the Yale School of Architecture (1974).\n In 1977, Plater-Zyberk co-founded the Miami firm Arquitectonica with her husband Andr\u00e9s Duany, Bernardo Fort-Brescia, Laurinda Hope Spear, and Hervin Romney. Arquitectonica became famous for its signature style: a dramatic, expressive \"high-tech\" modernism. The firm's Atlantis Condominium was featured prominently in the opening credits of the television series Miami Vice.\n In 1980, Duany and Plater-Zyberk founded Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company (DPZ), based in Miami. DPZ became a leader in the national movement called New Urbanism and distinguished itself by designing traditional towns and transforming existing suburbs into livable downtowns. The firm first received international recognition in the 1980s as the designer of Seaside, Florida, and has completed designs and codes for over two hundred new towns, regional plans, and community revitalization projects.\n Plater-Zyberk began teaching at the University of Miami School of Architecture in 1979, starting what became a long and successful association. Having created a graduate program in Suburb and Town Design in 1988, she continued to explore contemporary issues in city growth and reconstruction with students and faculty. She served as dean of the university's School of Architecture from 1995 to 2013,[3] and as dean she hired the architect L\u00e9on Krier to design his first public building in Florida for the school of architecture (his only other buildings in America are his former house at Seaside and a meeting hall in the Duany Plater-Zyberk planned resort of Windsor). She has also served as director of the university's Center for Urban Community and Design, organizing and promoting numerous design exercises to the benefit of communities throughout South Florida. In the Fall of 2008, Plater-Zyberk was tapped into Iron Arrow Honor Society, the highest Honor attained at the University of Miami. In 2014, she was awarded the Arts & Culture Award by the Coral Gables Community Foundation.\n For ten years, Plater-Zyberk was a Trustee of Princeton University, where she chaired the university's Building Committee during an active period of building and expansion. During her tenure on the Building Committee, the university hired architects such as Robert Venturi, Frank Gehry, and Demetri Porphyrios. Porphyrios designed the Collegiate Gothic Whitman College, the first in a series of new Collegiate Gothic buildings to be built in the historic center of the campus.\n Plater-Zyberk is a founder and emeritus board member of the Congress for the New Urbanism, which was established in 1993. She has been a visiting professor at many major North American schools of architecture, has been awarded several honorary doctorates and awards, and lectures frequently. In 2001, she and Duany were awarded the Vincent Scully Prize by the National Building Museum in recognition of their contributions to the American built environment.[4] In 2008, she was appointed to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts.[5]  Her recent books include The New Civic Art and Suburban Nation: The Rise of Sprawl and the Decline of the American Dream.\n ", "tags": ["1950 births", "Living people", "American urban planners", "Women urban planners", "New Urbanism", "Schools of the Sacred Heart alumni", "People from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania", "Plater family", "University of Miami faculty", "American women architects", "Driehaus Architecture Prize winners", "Architects from Miami", "Yale School of Architecture alumni", "Princeton University School of Architecture alumni", "New Classical architects", "21st-century American architects", "Vincent Scully Prize winners", "21st-century American women artists", "CS1 maint: location", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Elizabeth Plater-ZyberkElizabeth Plater-ZyberkBorn (1950-12-20) December 20, 1950 (age\u00a070)Bryn Mawr, PennsylvaniaNationalityUSAOccupationArchitect and urban plannerKnown\u00a0forShe is considered to be a representative of the New Urbanism school of urban planning, and an advocate of the New Classical school of architecture.\nAmerican architect and urban planner\nElizabeth Plater-Zyberk (born December 20, 1950) is an American architect and urban planner based in Miami, Florida.
