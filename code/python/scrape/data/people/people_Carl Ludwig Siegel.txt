{"name": "Carl Ludwig Siegel", "content": "Carl Ludwig Siegel (31 December 1896 \u2013 4 April 1981) was a German mathematician specialising in analytic number theory. He is known for, amongst other things, his contributions to the Thue\u2013Siegel\u2013Roth theorem in Diophantine approximation and the Siegel mass formula for quadratic forms. He was named as one of the most important mathematicians of the 20th century.[1][2]\n Andr\u00e9 Weil, without hesitation, named[3] Siegel as the greatest mathematician of the first half of the 20th century. Atle Selberg said of Siegel and his work:\n He was in some ways, perhaps, the most impressive mathematician I have met. I would say, in a way, devastatingly so. The things that Siegel tended to do were usually things that seemed impossible. Also after they were done, they still seemed almost impossible. Siegel was born in Berlin, where he enrolled at the Humboldt University in Berlin in 1915 as a student in mathematics, astronomy, and physics. Amongst his teachers were Max Planck and Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, whose influence made the young Siegel abandon astronomy and turn towards number theory instead. His best student was J\u00fcrgen Moser, one of the founders of KAM theory (Kolmogorov\u2013Arnold\u2013Moser), which lies at the foundations of chaos theory. Another notable student was Kurt Mahler, the number theorist.\n Siegel was an antimilitarist, and in 1917, during World War I he was committed to a psychiatric institute as a conscientious objector. According to his own words, he withstood the experience only because of his support from Edmund Landau, whose father had a clinic in the neighborhood. After the end of World War I, he enrolled at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, studying under Landau, who was his doctoral thesis supervisor (Ph.D. in 1920). He stayed in G\u00f6ttingen as a teaching and research assistant; many of his groundbreaking results were published during this period. In 1922, he was appointed professor at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4t of Frankfurt am Main as the successor of Arthur Moritz Sch\u00f6nflies. Siegel, who was deeply opposed to Nazism, was a close friend of the docents Ernst Hellinger and Max Dehn and used his influence to help them. This attitude prevented Siegel's appointment as a successor to the chair of Constantin Carath\u00e9odory in Munich.[4] In Frankfurt he took part with Dehn, Hellinger, Paul Epstein, and others in a seminar on the history of mathematics, which was conducted at the highest level. In the seminar they read only original sources. Siegel's reminiscences about the time before World War II are in an essay in his collected works.\n In 1936 he was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in Oslo. In 1938, he returned to G\u00f6ttingen before emigrating in 1940 via Norway to the United States, where he joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he had already spent a sabbatical in 1935. He returned to G\u00f6ttingen only after World War II, when he accepted a post as professor in 1951, which he kept until his retirement in 1959. In 1968 he was elected a foreign associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.[5]\n Siegel's work on number theory, diophantine equations, and celestial mechanics in particular won him numerous honours. In 1978, he was awarded the first Wolf Prize in Mathematics, one of the most prestigious in the field. When the prize committee decided to select the greatest living mathematician, the discussion centered around Siegel and Israel Gelfand as the leading candidates. The prize was ultimately split between them.[6]\n Siegel's work spans analytic number theory; and his theorem on the finiteness of the integer points of curves, for genus > 1, is historically important as a major general result on diophantine equations, when the field was essentially undeveloped. He worked on L-functions, discovering the (presumed illusory) Siegel zero phenomenon. His work, derived from the Hardy\u2013Littlewood circle method on quadratic forms, appeared in the later, adele group theories encompassing the use of theta-functions. The Siegel modular varieties, which describe Siegel modular forms, are recognised as part of the moduli theory of abelian varieties. In all this work the structural implications of analytic methods show through.\n In the early 1970s Weil gave a series of seminars on the history of number theory prior to the 20th century and he remarked that Siegel once told him that when the first person discovered the simplest case of Faulhaber's formula then, in Siegel's words, \"Es gefiel dem lieben Gott.\" (It pleased the dear Lord.) Siegel was a profound student of the history of mathematics and put his studies to good use in such works as the Riemann\u2013Siegel formula.\n by Siegel:\n about Siegel:\n ", "tags": ["1896 births", "1981 deaths", "20th-century German mathematicians", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty", "Goethe University Frankfurt faculty", "Institute for Advanced Study faculty", "Number theorists", "Wolf Prize in Mathematics laureates", "Knights Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from July 2020", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "For the German architecture professor, see Carl August Benjamin Siegel.\nCarl Ludwig SiegelCarl Ludwig Siegel in 1975Born(1896-12-31)31 December 1896Berlin, German EmpireDied4 April 1981(1981-04-04) (aged\u00a084)G\u00f6ttingen, West GermanyAlma\u00a0materUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenKnown\u00a0forBrauer\u2013Siegel theoremSiegel modular formSiegel modular varietySiegel zeroSmith\u2013Minkowski\u2013Siegel mass formulaThue\u2013Siegel\u2013Roth theoremAwardsWolf Prize (1978)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsJohann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4tInstitute for Advanced StudyDoctoral advisorEdmund LandauDoctoral students\nHel Braun\nKurt Mahler\nChristian Pommerenke\nTheodor Schneider\nJ\u00fcrgen Moser\n\n\nCarl Ludwig Siegel (31 December 1896 \u2013 4 April 1981) was a German mathematician specialising in analytic number theory.
