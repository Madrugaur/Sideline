{"name": "K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3", "content": "K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3 de Egerfarmos et Sztregova (egerfarmosi \u00e9s sztregovai Kand\u00f3 K\u00e1lm\u00e1n; 10 July 1869 \u2013 13 January 1931) was a Hungarian engineer, the inventor of phase converter and a pioneer in the development of AC electric railway traction.\n He was educated at the Budapest Technical University where he gained a diploma in mechanical engineering in 1892. Kand\u00f3 served as a volunteer for the Austro-Hungarian Navy until 1893. \n After his military service, he travelled to France, and worked for the Fives-Lille Company in France as a junior engineer, where he designed and developed early induction motors for locomotives. For the manufacture of induction motors, he developed a completely new design-calculation procedure, which made it possible to produce economical AC traction motors for the Fives Lille Company. Within a year, Kand\u00f3 was appointed as the chief engineer of the electric motor development at the French firm.[1] Andr\u00e1s Mechwart (the Ganz and Co.\u2019s managing director at that time) asked him to return to Hungary in 1894 and invited him to work at the Electrical Engineering Department of the Ganz Works.\n In 1894, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3 developed high-voltage three phase alternating current motors and generators for electric locomotives; he is known as the father of the electric train. His work on railway electrification was done at the Ganz electric works in Budapest.  Kand\u00f3's early 1894 designs were first applied in a short three-phase AC tramway in Evian-les-Bains (France), which was constructed between 1896 and 1898. It was driven by 37 HP asynchronous traction system.[2][3][4][5][6]\n In 1907 he moved with his family to Vado Ligure in Italy and obtained employment with Societ\u00e0 Italiana Westinghouse.[7] He would later return to Budapest to work at the Ganz factory where he became the managing director.\n \n Under his leadership the Ganz factory began work on three-phase haulage for railways. Based on their design, the Italian Ferrovia della Valtellina was electrified in 1902 and became Europe's first electrified main line railway.\n For the Valtellina line, three-phase power was supplied at 3,000 volts (later increased to 3,600 volts) through two overhead lines, while the running rails supplied the third phase. At junctions, the two overhead lines had to cross and this prevented the use of very high voltages.\n The three-phase, two wire, system was used on several railways in Northern Italy and became known as \"the Italian system\". There are now few railways which use this system.\n In 1907, the Italian government decided for the electrification of another 2000-km railway line and insisted on manufacturing the engines and equipment in Italy. They bought Kand\u00f3's patents and put him in charge of the management and design of the new Kand\u00f3-type engines and paid licence-fee for the electric motors to the Ganz factory. Two types of locomotives were developed with his leadership in Italy: a 1500 kw cinquanta[clarification needed] and a 2100 kw trenta[clarification needed] electric locomotives, from which altogether some 700 units were produced. 540 of these were still in service in 1945, the last three-phase line worked until 1976.\nIn honour of Kand\u00f3\u2019s work, he was awarded with Commendatore dell'Ordine della Corona d'Italia (Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy), but in 1915 he had to flee through Switzerland, since Italy entered World War I on the Entente side and declared war on the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.\n During World War I between 1916 and 1917, Kand\u00f3 was a lieutenant completing military service for the Ministry of Defence in Vienna. He worked out a revolutionary system of phase-changing electrical hauling, whereby locomotives were powered by the standard, 50-period, single-phase alternating current used in the national energy supply system.\nHe was the first who recognised that an electric train system can only be successful if it can use the electricity from public networks.\nIn 1918,[8] Kand\u00f3 invented and developed the rotary phase converter, enabling electric locomotives to use three-phase motors whilst supplied via a single overhead wire, carrying the simple industrial frequency (50\u00a0Hz) single phase AC of the high voltage national networks.[9]\n To avoid the problems associated with the use of two overhead wires, Kand\u00f3 developed a modified system for use in Hungary. Power semiconductors not having been invented yet in the 1930s, the Kand\u00f3 V40 locomotives' systems relied on electromechanics and electrochemistry.\n Single-phase power was supplied at 16,000 volts and 50\u00a0Hz through a single overhead line and converted to three-phase on the locomotive by a rotary phase converter.[10] The drive motors, made by Metropolitan-Vickers, had a very large diameter of 3 meters and incorporated four sets of 24 magnetic poles each, which could be added to the traction effort at will, producing highly efficient constant speeds of 25, 50, 75 and 100\u00a0km/h over rail (or 17/34/51/68\u00a0km/h for the V60 heavy freight train engine variant, which had six pairs of smaller driving wheels).\n \nHe created an electric machine called a synchronous phase converter, which was a single-phase synchronous motor and a three-phase synchronous generator with common stator and rotor.\n It had two independent windings:\n \n A major benefit of this arrangement was a power factor of nearly 1.00 in the catenary-attached equipment, which fulfilled the electric powerplants' strict load-distributing regulations. The unacceptably poor power factor of pre-World War II design electric motors (occasionally as low as 0.65) was not felt outside the Kando locomotives, as the phase changer machinery provided isolation.\n Intermediate speeds were maintained by connecting a water and saltpeter based adjustable resistor to the line, which reduced the efficiency of the locomotive. Timetables for electrified lines were supposed to allow use of full efficiency constant speeds most of the time but, in practice, the need to share the track with trains hauled by M\u00c1V Class 424 steam locomotives meant the water-hungry and wasteful \"gearbox resistor\" had to be used often.\n The propulsive force was transferred to the locomotive's wheels using a traditional pushrod system, designed to provide manufacturing and maintenance commodity to the predominantly steam-based Hungarian Railways (M\u00c1V) of the time. The so-called Kand\u00f3 triangle arrangement [11] transferred power from the electric motor to the pushrods in such a way that no oblique forces were exerted on the chassis, making the V40 less hurtful to the rail track compared to steam engines. In practice the V40 pushrod system was too precise for steam-era habits based maintenance and required more frequent care.\n More than a decade after Kand\u00f3's death two new, shaft-driven prototypes of his design were built by the Ganz company, to allow for 125\u00a0km/h traction speeds. The V44 electric locomotives [12] proved too heavy for general use, owing to their 22 metric ton per axle rail load. Both vehicles were eventually destroyed in USAAF bombing raids in 1944, running only 16,000 kilometers overall.\n After the second World War, a last series of electric phase-changer locomotives were built by the new communist government in Hungary. Owing to Cold War restrictions, the innovative V55 type,[13] which used bogie-mounted motors, had to be constructed of domestic components entirely and suffered from reliability problems in their double-conversion phase-changer / frequency-changer propulsion system. (The traction motors of pre-WWII V40 and V60 locomotives were made in Britain by the Metropolitan-Vickers company, as part of an economic aid programme organized by Lord Rothermere.)\n Currently one example of the V40,[14] the V55 [15] and the V60 locomotive [16] each survives. They are preserved at the Budapest Railway History Park, but require restoration after decades of open air static display. If funding permits, the repaired V40 may return to the open track for \"nostalgic service\", with a semiconductor front-end added to its system for 25 to 16 kV AC down-step conversion.\n Kand\u00f3 designed in 1926 the 1.5 kV DC 2BB2 400 (fr:2BB2 400) for the Paris-Orleans line which were the strongest DC locomotives in Europe at that time.\n There were plans to use the two-wire, three-phase, system on the  Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway in Wales and the Metropolitan Railway in London but neither of these plans came to fruition due to the outbreak of WW II.\n K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3 died at Budapest in 1931 but his work lives on. Many modern electric trains work on the same three-phase high tension AC principle introduced by the Kand\u00f3 V40 locomotives, but the rotary converter is replaced by semiconductor devices. Three-phase powered electric motors allow for high traction effort even at great speeds and the difficulty of maintaining arbitrary speeds at full efficiency is eliminated by using IGBT semiconductors and the use of digital controls.\n In Miskolc, the square in front of the Tiszai railway station, where his statue is also standing, bears his name, as well as a vocational secondary school. In Budapest, the Kand\u00f3 K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Faculty of Electrical Engineering (formerly an independent technical college, now part of \u00d3buda University), also bears his name. The minor planet 126245 Kand\u00f3k\u00e1lm\u00e1n was named after him.\n ", "tags": ["1869 births", "1931 deaths", "Hungarian electrical engineers", "Hungarian people in rail transport", "Italian people in rail transport", "Locomotive builders and designers", "Burials at Kerepesi Cemetery", "Hungarian inventors", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles needing clarification from November 2020", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian engineer and inventor of phase converter (1869-1931)\nThe native form of this personal name is Kand\u00f3 K\u00e1lm\u00e1n.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nKalman KandoBorn10 July 1869\u00a0(1869-07-10)Pest, Austria-HungaryDied13 January 1931\u00a0(1931-01-14) (aged\u00a061)Budapest, HungaryOccupationengineer\nK\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3 de Egerfarmos et Sztregova (egerfarmosi \u00e9s sztregovai Kand\u00f3 K\u00e1lm\u00e1n; 10 July 1869 \u2013 13 January 1931) was a Hungarian engineer, the inventor of phase converter and a pioneer in the development of AC electric railway traction.\n\nContents\n\n1 Education\n\n1.1 France\n\n\n2 Work on railway electrification\n\n2.1 Ganz Company, Budapest\n2.2 Italy, Designing the World's first electrified main railway line\n2.3 Vienna, invention of the phase converter\n2.4 Hungary\n\n2.4.1 Kand\u00f3 synchronous phase converter\n\n\n2.5 France\n2.6 United Kingdom\n\n\n3 Kand\u00f3's legacy\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nEducation[edit]\nHe was educated at the Budapest Technical University where he gained a diploma in mechanical engineering in 1892.
