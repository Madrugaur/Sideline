She is an associate professor at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts and co-founder of the online platform Lathisms.[1] She is also an editor of the e-mentoring blog of the American Mathematical Society (AMS).[2]\n Harris first emigrated with her family from Mexico to the United States when she was 8 years old.[3][4] They returned to Mexico, before eventually settling in Wisconsin when Harris was 12.[3][5] Because she was undocumented, she could not attend university.[6][5] Instead, she studied at the Milwaukee Area Technical College, where she earned two associate degrees in two and a half years.[5][6] After she married a US citizen and her immigration status changed, she transferred to Marquette University, where she obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics.[6][3] She went on to complete her master's degree and in 2012 a PhD at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Her PhD dissertation was advised by Jeb F. Willenbring.[7] Harris was a Project NExT (New Experiences in Teaching) fellow in 2012.[8] She was a Davies Research Fellow at the United States Military Academy,[3][5] and, in 2016, joined the faculty at Williams College[9][5] where she is now an associate professor.[10]\n Harris studies algebraic combinatorics, in particular the representation of Lie algebras.[5] In order to understand this representation she studies vector partition functions, in particular Kostant's partition function.[3] She is also interested in graph theory and number theory.[9]  In 2016 she co-founded an online platform called 'Lathisms' which aims to promote the contributions of Latinxs and Hispanics in the Mathematical Sciences.[1][3] In 2020 she co-authored the book \"Asked and Answered: Dialogues On Advocating For Students of Color in Mathematics\".[11] Harris, along with Aris Winger, run a podcast, Mathematically Uncensored, through the Center for Minorities in the Mathematical Sciences.\u00a0Starting in October 2020, they discussed current issues in mathematics that minorities encounter.[12]\n In 2020, Harris was selected as part of the inaugural class of Karen EDGE Fellows.[13] In 2019, Harris won the Mathematical Association of America Henry L.
