{"name": "Adolf von Baeyer", "content": "Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer (German: [\u02c8ba\u026a\u0250]; 31 October 1835 \u2013 20 August 1917) was a German chemist who synthesised indigo[1] and developed a nomenclature for cyclic compounds (that was subsequently extended and adopted as part of the IUPAC organic nomenclature). He was ennobled in the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1885 and was the 1905 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.[2]\n Baeyer was born in Berlin as the son of the noted geodesist and lieutenant-general in the Royal Prussian Army Johann Jacob Baeyer and his wife Eugenie Baeyer n\u00e9e Hitzig (1807\u20131843).[3] Both his parents were Lutherans at the time of his birth and he was raised in the Lutheran religion.[4] His mother was the daughter of Julius Eduard Hitzig and a member of the originally Jewish Itzig family, and had converted to Christianity before marrying his father, who was of non-Jewish German descent. Baeyer had four sisters: Clara (born 1826) Emma (born 1831), Johanna (Jeanette) (born 1839), Adelaide (died 1843) and two brothers: Georg (born 1829) and Edward (born 1832). Baeyer lost his mother at a young age while she was giving birth to his sister Adelaide.[5]\n Although his birth name was Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf Baeyer, he was known simply as \"Adolf Baeyer\", throughout most of his life. The poet Adelbert von Chamisso and the astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel were his godparents. On his 50th birthday he was raised to the hereditary nobility by King Ludwig II of Bavaria, conferring on him the \u201cvon\u201d distinction.[6]\n Baeyer charted his own path into science early on, performing experiments on plant nutrition at his paternal grandfather's M\u00fcggelsheim farm as a boy; back in the confines of Berlin, he took to the test tubes with chemical experimentation starting at the age of nine. Three years later, he synthesized a previously unknown chemical compound -double carbonate of copper and sodium.[6][7] On his 13th birthday, he initiated his lifework, buying a chunk of indigo worth two Thalers for his first dye experiments.[6]\n When still a schoolboy, his chemistry teacher at the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium appointed him as his assistant. After graduating from secondary school in 1853, he entered the Berlin University to study physics and mathematics. A stint in the Prussian army interrupted his study until 1856, when he returned to academia at the University of Heidelberg, intending to study chemistry under Robert Bunsen.[citation needed]  After an argument with the renowned chemist, however, he changed his mentor to August Kekul\u00e9. He continued to collaborate with Kekule even after he returned to Berlin in 1858 for the completion of his doctorate on arsenic methyl chloride, or cacodylic.[6]\n After completing his doctorate, he followed Kekul\u00e9 to the University of Ghent, when Kekul\u00e9 became professor there. He became a lecturer at the Berlin Gewerbeinstitut (Royal Trade Academy\u00a0[de]) in 1860 and a Professor at the University of Strasbourg in 1871. In 1875, he succeeded Justus von Liebig as Chemistry Professor at the University of Munich.[8]\n Baeyer's chief achievements include the synthesis and description of the plant dye indigo, the discovery of the phthalein dyes, and the investigation of polyacetylenes, oxonium salts, nitroso compounds (1869) and uric acid derivatives (1860 and onwards) (including the discovery of barbituric acid (1864), the parent compound of the barbiturates). He was the first to propose the correct formula for indole in 1869, after publishing the first synthesis three years earlier. His contributions to theoretical chemistry include the 'strain' (Spannung) theory of triple bonds and strain theory in small carbon rings.[9]\n In 1871 he discovered the synthesis of phenolphthalein by condensation of phthalic anhydride with two equivalents of phenol under acidic conditions (hence the name). That same year he was the first to obtain synthetic fluorescein, a fluorophore pigment which is similar to naturally occurring pyoverdin that is synthesised by microorganisms (e.g., by some fluorescent strains of Pseudomonas). Baeyer named his finding \"resorcinphthalein\" as he had synthesised it from phthalic anhydride and resorcinol. The term fluorescein would not start to be used until 1878.\n In 1872 he experimented with phenol and formaldehyde; the resinous product[10] was a precursor for Leo Baekeland's later commercialization of Bakelite.\n In 1881 the Royal Society of London awarded Baeyer the Davy Medal for his work with indigo. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1884.[11] In 1905 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"in recognition of his services in the advancement of organic chemistry and the chemical industry, through his work on organic dyes and hydroaromatic compounds\", and he continued in full active work as one of the best-known teachers in the world of organic chemistry up to within a year of his death.[12]\n Since 1911, is established the Adolf von Baeyer Medal\u00a0[de] which is awarded annually.\n His name is reflected in various \"name reactions\" as the Baeyer\u2013Villiger oxidation and Baeyer's reagent. There is also the Von Baeyer nomenclature in structural chemistry and Baeyer strain theory (which granted him the Nobel prize) of alicyclic compounds.\n He was elected member to several scientific academies, in 1884 to the Prussian Academy of Sciences[14] and 1885 a foreign member of the Royal Society.[15]\n In 2009 von Baeyer lunar crater was named after him.\n In 1868, Baeyer married Adelheid (Lida) Bendemann, the daughter of a family friend, and together the couple had three children: Eugenie, Hans, and Otto\u00a0[de].[6]\n ", "tags": ["1835 births", "1917 deaths", "19th-century German chemists", "20th-century German chemists", "Scientists from Berlin", "German people of Jewish descent", "German Nobel laureates", "Nobel laureates in Chemistry", "Organic chemists", "Heidelberg University alumni", "Humboldt University of Berlin alumni", "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni", "University of Strasbourg faculty", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Members of the Lincean Academy", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art", "Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)", "German Lutherans", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Harv and Sfn no-target errors", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1922 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1922 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from August 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "For the founder of the pharmaceutical company Bayer, see Friedrich Bayer.\nAdolf von BaeyerBaeyer in 1905BornJohann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf Baeyer(1835-10-31)31 October 1835Berlin, Prussia (German Confederation)Died20 August 1917(1917-08-20) (aged\u00a081)Starnberg, (Bavaria) German EmpireNationalityGermanyAlma\u00a0materUniversity of BerlinKnown\u00a0forSynthesis of indigo, phenolphthalein and fluorescein; Baeyer nomenclatureSpouse(s)Adelheid Bendemann (m. 1868Children3; including Otto\u00a0[de].AwardsDavy Medal (1881)Liebig Medal (1903) Nobel Prize for Chemistry (1905)Elliott Cresson Medal (1912)Scientific careerFieldsOrganic chemistryInstitutionsUniversity of BerlinGewerbe-Akademie, BerlinUniversity of StrasbourgUniversity of MunichDoctoral advisorFriedrich August Kekul\u00e9[citation needed]Doctoral studentsEmil FischerJohn Ulric NefVictor VilligerCarl Theodore LiebermannCarl Gr\u00e4beInfluencedOtto Hahn\n\nJohann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer (German: [\u02c8ba\u026a\u0250]; 31 October 1835 \u2013 20 August 1917) was a German chemist who synthesised indigo[1] and developed a nomenclature for cyclic compounds (that was subsequently extended and adopted as part of the IUPAC organic nomenclature).
