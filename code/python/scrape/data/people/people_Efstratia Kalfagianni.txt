{"name": "Efstratia Kalfagianni", "content": "Efstratia (Effie) Kalfagianni is a Greek American mathematician specializing in low-dimensional topology.\n Kalfagianni was born in 1965 in Greece. She lived on a small Greek island most of her early life.  She started getting into math as a sophomore in high school because of classes in  euclidean geometry and elementary number theory. Her teachers encouraged her to pursue math in college as well.\n Kalfagianni graduated from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in October 1987. After earning a master's degree in 1990 at Fordham University,[1]\nshe moved to Columbia University for doctoral studies, earning a second master's degree in 1991 and completing her Ph.D. in 1995. Her dissertation, Finite Type Invariants for Knots in 3-Manifolds, was supervised by Joan Birman and Xiao-Song Lin .[1][2]\n After postdoctoral study at the Institute for Advanced Study and three years as Hill Assistant Professor at Rutgers University, she moved to Michigan State University in 1998. She was promoted to full professor in 2008[1] and received the MSU William J.
