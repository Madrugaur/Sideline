{"name": "Lars Edvard Phragm\u00e9n", "content": "Lars Edvard Phragm\u00e9n (2 September 1863 \u00d6rebro \u2013 13 March 1937) was a Swedish mathematician.  The son of a college professor, he studied at Uppsala then Stockholm, graduating from Uppsala in 1889. He became professor at Stockholm in 1892, after Sofia Kovalevskaia.\n He left Uppsala less than a year after, becoming professor Mittag-Leffler's assistant at Stockholm. In 1884, he provided a new proof of the Cantor-Bendixson theorem.\n His work focused on elliptic functions and complex analysis. His most famous result is the extension of Liouville's theorem to analytic functions on a sector. A first version was proposed by Phragm\u00e9n, then improved by the Finnish mathematician Ernst Lindel\u00f6f. They jointly published this last version,[1] known as the Phragm\u00e9n\u2013Lindel\u00f6f principle.\n He left the university in 1903, joining the Royal Inspection of Insurance Companies. He became director the following year. In 1908, he was appointed director of the insurance company Allm\u00e4nna Liff\u00f6rsakringsbolaget.\n From 1889 until his death, he was an active editor of Acta Mathematica. He is also famous for having pointed out (at 26) an unclear part of Henri Poincar\u00e9's preprint on the three-body problem. This led Poincar\u00e9 to discover a major mistake in his own work, paving the way to important developments in chaos theory.\n In addition to analysis, Phragm\u00e9n was interested in the mathematics underlying insurance companies, and voting.\n ", "tags": ["Swedish mathematicians", "Stockholm University faculty", "Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences", "1863 births", "1937 deaths", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Swedish mathematician\nLars Edvard Phragm\u00e9n (2 September 1863 \u00d6rebro \u2013 13 March 1937) was a Swedish mathematician.  \nThe son of a college professor, he studied at Uppsala then Stockholm, graduating from Uppsala in 1889.
