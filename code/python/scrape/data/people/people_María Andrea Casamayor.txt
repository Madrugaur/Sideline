{"name": "Mar\u00eda Andrea Casamayor", "content": "\n Maria Andresa Casamayor de La Coma (Spanish: Mar\u00eda Andresa Casamayor de La Coma, Sarragosa, November 30, 1720 -Sarragosa, October 23, 1780) was a Spanish mathematician, writer and Spanish girls\u2019 school teacher. She stood out for her mathematical thinking and work with numbers and made significant contributions to arithmetic, which at the time was considered the exclusive domain of men. She is one of the few 18th century Spanish women scientists and mathematicians whose work has been preserved, including Mar\u00eda Pascuala Caro Sureda.\n Maria Andresa Casamayor de La Coma was born on November 30 (Saint Andrew's Day), 1720. She was baptized the next day in the Church of El Pilar (Spanish: Iglesia del Pilar) and given the name of Maria Juana Rosa Andresa. Born into a wealthy family of textile merchants, Maria Andresa spent her childhood in a house on Pilar Street (Spanish: Calle del Pilar). Her father was the French merchant Juan Joseph Casamayor born in Oloron (France), son of Maria Abales and Juan Casamayor. Her mother was a Saragossan, Juana Rosa de La Coma, daughter of merchant Juan de La Coma and of Maria Alexandre, both of French origins. At the time, the French community was made up of a large number of individuals who maintained tight trade connections and dominated the trade in Saragossa. Her parents married on April 13, 1705, and Maria Andresa was the seventh of nine children.\n She published two books on arithmetic:\n She wrote under a male pseudonym, her nom de plume being Casandro Mam\u00e9s de La Marca y Araioa. This name was a perfect anagram formed by rearranging all the letters that compose her own name, Maria Andresa Casamayor de La Coma. Oddly enough, there is a name spelling mistake in the source of this information, a quotation from the \u201cNew Bibliography of Aragonese Writers\u201d, (Spanish: Biblioteca nueva de los escritores aragoneses) by F\u00e9lix Latassa. In Latassa's catalogue, Maria Andresa is listed under the name of \u201cMaria Andrea\u201d. Following Latassa, the name Maria Andrea is still used today.[2] However, according to the baptismal certificate, she was named Maria Andresa.\n In the Tyrocinio, Casandro claimed to be a \"disciple of the Piarist School\" (Spanish: Escuela P\u00eda) and dedicated the book to the same school, \u201cEscuela P\u00eda del Colegio de Santo Tom\u00e1s de Zaragoza\u201d.\n With the death of her father in 1738, and that of the friend and collaborator, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, in 1739, the young Maria Andresa Casamayor had lost her main support. Maria Andresa never married or entered a religious order, as expected from women in the Aragonese society of that time. She had to work to support herself financially. For the greater part of her life, she taught at a girls\u2019 school, working as a teacher of primary education in the public schools of the city. She lived in a house that had been given to her as part of her payment. The building still exists today and is located on Palomar street (Spanish: Calle Palomar) in Saragossa.[3]\n In 2009, the City Council of Saragossa renamed a street in her honor (originally \"Grupo Jose Antonio Gir\u00f3n\").[4][5] A street named after Saragossa's famous woman scientist can also be found in Gijon.[6]\n In 2018, she was included in the periodic table of women scientists (Spanish: La Tabla Peri\u00f3dica de las Cient\u00edficas), which represents women in science from around the world.[7]\n ", "tags": ["1700 births", "1780 deaths", "18th-century Spanish people", "Women mathematicians", "18th-century Spanish women writers", "18th-century women scientists", "Spanish mathematicians", "18th-century Spanish writers", "Use mdy dates from April 2020", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "No local image but image on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nSpanish mathematician and teacher\nMar\u00eda Andresa CasamayorBornMar\u00eda Juana Rosa Andresa Casamayor de La ComaNovember 30, 1720\u00a0(1720-11-30)Zaragoza, SpainDiedOctober 23, 1780(1780-10-23) (aged\u00a059)Zaragoza, SpainResting placeParroquia del Pilar, Zaragoza, SpainKnown\u00a0forMathematician, writer, girls' school teacherScientific careerFieldsMathematics\n\nMaria Andresa Casamayor de La Coma (Spanish: Mar\u00eda Andresa Casamayor de La Coma, Sarragosa, November 30, 1720 -Sarragosa, October 23, 1780) was a Spanish mathematician, writer and Spanish girls\u2019 school teacher.

She was baptized the next day in the Church of El Pilar (Spanish: Iglesia del Pilar) and given the name of Maria Juana Rosa Andresa. Born into a wealthy family of textile merchants, Maria Andresa spent her childhood in a house on Pilar Street (Spanish: Calle del Pilar). Her father was the French merchant Juan Joseph Casamayor born in Oloron (France), son of Maria Abales and Juan Casamayor. Her mother was a Saragossan, Juana Rosa de La Coma, daughter of merchant Juan de La Coma and of Maria Alexandre, both of French origins. At the time, the French community was made up of a large number of individuals who maintained tight trade connections and dominated the trade in Saragossa. Her parents married on April 13, 1705, and Maria Andresa was the seventh of nine children.\n\nWorks[edit]\nShe published two books on arithmetic:\n\nHer first published book is entitled Tyrocinio aritm\u00e9tico (1738),[1] From a mathematical point of view, the book is eminently practical and written in a fresh and supple language. A great number or examples based on real cases are given to the reader. Thus, one can learn directly the four rules of arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In addition, the examples covered in this book indicate that she had precise knowledge of length, weight, and currency units that were used to perform the daily trade activities in the 18th century. As the Dominican priest Pedro Mart\u00ednez, a friend and collaborator of Maria Andresa, revealed in the review of the book, \"her aim, in this brief piece of work, is to bring the education to the many who have no means to achieve it\". Thus, according to her professional profile, Maria Andresa Casamayor is to be commended for her unusually great arithmetic ability and deep concern for education.\nEl para s\u00ed solo, her second book, is a 109-page unpublished manuscript on advanced arithmetic.\nShe wrote under a male pseudonym, her nom de plume being Casandro Mam\u00e9s de La Marca y Araioa. This name was a perfect anagram formed by rearranging all the letters that compose her own name, Maria Andresa Casamayor de La Coma. Oddly enough, there is a name spelling mistake in the source of this information, a quotation from the \u201cNew Bibliography of Aragonese Writers\u201d, (Spanish: Biblioteca nueva de los escritores aragoneses) by F\u00e9lix Latassa. In Latassa's catalogue, Maria Andresa is listed under the name of \u201cMaria Andrea\u201d. Following Latassa, the name Maria Andrea is still used today.[2] However, according to the baptismal certificate, she was named Maria Andresa.\nIn the Tyrocinio, Casandro claimed to be a \"disciple of the Piarist School\" (Spanish: Escuela P\u00eda) and dedicated the book to the same school, \u201cEscuela P\u00eda del Colegio de Santo Tom\u00e1s de Zaragoza\u201d.\n\nGirls' school teacher[edit]\nWith the death of her father in 1738, and that of the friend and collaborator, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, in 1739, the young Maria Andresa Casamayor had lost her main support. Maria Andresa never married or entered a religious order, as expected from women in the Aragonese society of that time. She had to work to support herself financially.
