{"name": "Gregory Goodwin Pincus", "content": "Gregory Goodwin Pincus (April 9, 1903 \u2013 August 22, 1967) was an American biologist and researcher who co-invented the combined oral contraceptive pill.[1]\n Gregory Goodwin Pincus was born in Woodbine, New Jersey to Jewish parents, who were immigrants from the Russian Empire.[2] His father was Joseph Pincus, a teacher and the editor of a farm journal, and his mother was Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Lipman), whose family had came from the region that is now Latvia.[3] He credited two uncles, both agricultural scientists, for his interest in research. His IQ was said to be 210 and his family considered him a genius.[4]\n Pincus attended Cornell University and received a bachelor's degree in agriculture in 1924. He attended Harvard University, where he was an instructor in zoology while also working toward his master's and doctorate degrees. From 1927 to 1930 he moved from Harvard to Cambridge University in England to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology with Richard Goldschmidt in Berlin where he performed research. He became an instructor in general physiology at Harvard University in 1930 and was promoted in 1931 to an assistant professor.\n Dr. Pincus began studying hormonal biology and steroidal hormones early in his career. He was interested in the way that hormones affected mammals' reproductive systems.  His first breakthrough came early, when he was able to produce in vitro fertilization in rabbits in 1934. In 1936, he published his discoveries after his experiments.  His experiments involving parthenogenesis produced a rabbit that appeared on the cover of Look magazine\nin 1937. To create the in vitro rabbit baby, Pincus removed the ovum from the mother rabbit and placed it in a solution mixture of saline and estrone.  Afterwards, he placed the \"fertilized\" ovum back into the rabbit.  Pincus' experiment became known as \"Pincogenesis\" because other scientists were unable to attain the same results when conducting the experiment.[citation needed]  After he was misquoted in an interview, it was believed that his experiment was the beginning of the use of in vitro for humans.[5]\n In 1944, Dr. Pincus co-founded the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.  He wanted to continue his research of the relationship between hormones and diseases such as, but not limited to, cancer, heart disease, and schizophrenia.  By the end of the 1960s, more than 300 international researchers came to participate in the Worcester Foundation of Experimental Biology.[6]\n Pincus never lost interest in mammals' reproduction systems.  He began to research infertility.[6]  In 1951, Margaret Sanger met Pincus at a dinner hosted by Abraham Stone, director of the Margaret Sanger Research Bureau and medical director and vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), and procured a small grant from PPFA for Pincus to begin hormonal contraceptive research.  Pincus, along with Min Chueh Chang, confirmed earlier research that progesterone would act as an inhibitor to ovulation.\n In 1952, Sanger told her friend Katharine McCormick about Pincus and Chang's research. Frustrated by PPFA's meager interest and support, McCormick and Sanger met with Pincus in 1953 to dramatically expand the scope of the research with 50-fold increase in funding from McCormick. Pincus was fascinated by Sanger because she revealed what life was like for women who were living in poverty who endured many pregnancies.  Sanger indirectly influenced him to create a successful contraceptive to prevent unwanted pregnancies.[6]\n In order to prove the safety of \"the pill,\" human trials had to be conducted. These were initiated on infertility patients of Dr. John Rock in Brookline, Massachusetts using progesterone in 1953 and then three different progestins in 1954. Puerto Rico was selected as a trial site in 1955, in part because there was an existing network of 67 birth control clinics serving low-income women on the island. Trials began there in 1956 and were supervised by Dr. Edris Rice-Wray and Celso-Ram\u00f3n Garc\u00eda.\n Some of the women experienced side effects from \"the pill\" (Enovid) and Edris Rice-Wray wrote Pincus and reported that Enovid \"gives one hundred percent protection against pregnancy [but causes] too many side reactions to be acceptable\". Pincus and Rock disagreed based on their experience with patients in Massachusetts and conducted research showing that placebos caused similar side effects. The trials went on and were expanded to Haiti, Mexico and Los Angeles despite high attrition rates, due to the large number of women eager to try this form of contraception.\n In May 1960, the FDA extended Enovid's approved indications to include contraception.\n Pincus married Elizabeth Notkin (1900-1988) in 1924 and they had three children together.[6]\n Pincus was the recipient of numerous awards.  Some of these awards include the Oliver Bird Prize in 1960, the Julius A. Koch Award in 1962, the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh in 1966, and the American Medical Association's Scientific Achievement Award in 1967.[6]  Pincus was acknowledged for his creation of the Laurentian Hormone Conference, which was a conference of endocrinologists.  Pincus served as the chairman of the conference and its purpose was to discuss the hormones of the endocrine system.  The conference was attended by endocrinologists from all over the world.\n He died in 1967 of myeloid metaplasia, a rare blood disease, in Boston, Massachusetts. He was 64 years old and lived in Northborough, Massachusetts.[1] His funeral was held August 25, 1967 at Temple Emanuel in Worcester, Massachusetts.[7]\n Pincus' birth control pill changed family life because it allowed women to plan when they had children. The birth control pill helped pave the way for women's liberation and the Sexual Revolution.[6]\n ", "tags": ["1903 births", "1967 deaths", "People from Woodbine, New Jersey", "American people of Latvian-Jewish descent", "American people of Russian-Jewish descent", "Jewish American scientists", "American biochemists", "Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences alumni", "Harvard University alumni", "Harvard University faculty", "Clark University faculty", "People from Northborough, Massachusetts", "Jewish inventors", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from September 2016", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Gregory PincusBorn(1903-04-09)April 9, 1903Woodbine, New Jersey, U.S.DiedAugust 22, 1967(1967-08-22) (aged\u00a064)Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.CitizenshipUnited StatesAlma\u00a0materCornell University  Harvard UniversityKnown\u00a0forCombined oral contraceptive pillSpouse(s)Elizabeth Notkin (died in 1988)AwardsCameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh (1966)Scientific careerFieldsBiologyInstitutionsHarvard University  Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology\n\nGregory Goodwin Pincus (April 9, 1903 \u2013 August 22, 1967) was an American biologist and researcher who co-invented the combined oral contraceptive pill.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Birth and education\n2 Research\n3 Personal life\n4 Awards\n5 Death\n6 Lasting impact\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 Further reading\n10 External links\n\n\nBirth and education[edit]\nGregory Goodwin Pincus was born in Woodbine, New Jersey to Jewish parents, who were immigrants from the Russian Empire.[2] His father was Joseph Pincus, a teacher and the editor of a farm journal, and his mother was Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Lipman), whose family had came from the region that is now Latvia.[3] He credited two uncles, both agricultural scientists, for his interest in research.
