He is best known for initiating the use of Monte Carlo methods in option pricing.[1]\n Born on a farm in Lavey, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, Phelim Boyle attended Dreenan School, Garron Tower and Queen's University Belfast (B.Sc.) He earned his M.Sc., and PhD in applied mathematics, specialising in physics, from Trinity College, Dublin.[2]\n He is a professor of finance in the Laurier School of Business & Economics at Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada.[3] Until June 2006 he held the J Page R Wadsworth Chair at the University of Waterloo.  Additional to his contributions to quantitative finance, he has published papers on actuarial science and demography. Together with his son, Feidhlim Boyle, he authored Derivatives: the Tools that Changed Finance. He continues to contribute in the area of quantitative finance.[citation needed]\n He has been awarded the Centennial Gold Medal of the International Actuarial Association, the Gold Medal of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, and was the recipient of the IAFE/SunGard Financial Engineer of the Year in 2005. In 2019, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.[citation needed]\n Boyle is best known for initiating the use of Monte Carlo methods in option pricing. Other well-known contributions in the area of quantitative finance include the use of the Trinomial method to price options.[4] His seminal work on Monte Carlo-based option pricing facilitated the 1980s explosion in the world of derivatives.[citation needed]\n Boyle has authored and co-authored numerous articles.[5] A selection:\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "Canadian actuaries", "British actuaries", "Monte Carlo methodologists", "Canadian economists", "Alumni of Trinity College Dublin", "Financial economists", "1941 births", "Wilfrid Laurier University faculty", "University of Waterloo faculty", "People from County Londonderry", "Alumni of Queen's University Belfast", "Use dmy dates from March 2020", "EngvarB from March 2020", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2020", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\nPhelim P.
