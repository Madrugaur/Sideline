A graduate of MIT and Columbia University, he held nineteen patents on his work.\n Edward L. Norton is best remembered for development of the dual of Thevenin's equivalent circuit, currently referred to as Norton's equivalent Circuit. \n He was interested in communications circuit theory and the transmission of data at high speeds over telephone lines.
