{"name": "Eug\u00e8ne Charles Catalan", "content": "\n Eug\u00e8ne Charles Catalan (30 May 1814 \u2013 14 February 1894)[1] was a French and Belgian mathematician who worked on continued fractions, descriptive geometry, number theory and combinatorics.

In 1825, he traveled to Paris and learned mathematics at \u00c9cole Polytechnique, where he met Joseph Liouville (1833). In December 1834 he was expelled along with most of the students in his year for political reasons;[2] he resumed his studies in January 1835, graduated that summer, and went on to teach at Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne.
