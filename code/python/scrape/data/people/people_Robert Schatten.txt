{"name": "Robert Schatten", "content": "Robert Schatten (January 28, 1911 \u2013 August 26, 1977) was an American mathematician.\n Robert Schatten was a born to a Jewish family in Lviv. His intellectual origins were at Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics, particularly well known for fundamental contributions to functional analysis. His entire family was murdered during World War II, he himself emigrated to the United States.\n In 1933 he got magister degree at Jan Kazimierz University of Lw\u00f3w, and in 1939 he got master's degree at Columbia University. Supervised by Francis Joseph Murray, he got doctorate degree in 1942 for the thesis \"On the Direct Product of Banach Spaces\". Shortly after being appointed to a junior professorship, he joined the United States army where during training he suffered a back injury which affected him for the remainder of his life. In 1943 he was appointed to an assistant professorship at University of Vermont. At National Research Council, by two years he worked with John von Neumann and Nelson Dunford. In 1946, he went to Kansas University, first as extraordinary professor until 1952 and then as ordinary professor until 1961. He stayed at Institute for Advanced Study in 1950 and 1952\u20131953, at  University of Southern California in 1960\u20131961, and at State University of New York in 1961\u20131962. In 1962 he became professor at Hunter College, where he stayed until his death.\n Schatten widely studied tensor products of Banach spaces. In functional analysis, he is the namesake of the Schatten norm and the Schatten class operators. His doctoral students included Elliott Ward Cheney, Jr. at University of Kansas, and Peter Falley and Charles Masiello at City University of New York.\n Schatten died in New York City in 1977.\n ", "tags": ["Polish mathematicians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "1911 births", "1977 deaths", "American people of Polish descent", "Polish Jews", "University of Kansas faculty", "University of Southern California faculty", "State University of New York faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nRobert SchattenBorn(1911-01-28)January 28, 1911Lw\u00f3w, PolandDiedAugust 26, 1977(1977-08-26) (aged\u00a066)New York CityNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materJan Kazimierz University of Lw\u00f3wColumbia UniversityKnown\u00a0forSchatten normSchatten class operatorScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of KansasCity University of New YorkThesisOn the Direct Product of Banach Spaces\u00a0(1943)Doctoral advisorFrancis Joseph MurrayDoctoral studentsElliott Ward Cheney, Jr.\n\nRobert Schatten (January 28, 1911 \u2013 August 26, 1977) was an American mathematician.\nRobert Schatten was a born to a Jewish family in Lviv.
