{"name": "Marcel Dassault", "content": "Marcel Dassault (born Marcel Ferdinand Bloch;[1] 22 January 1892 \u2013 17 April 1986) was a French engineer and industrialist who spent his career in aircraft manufacturing.\n Born on 22 January 1892 in Paris, he was the youngest of the four children of Adolphe Bloch, a doctor, and his wife No\u00e9mie Allatini.[2][3] His parents were Jewish.\n He was educated at Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet in Paris. After studies in electrical engineering,[2] he graduated from the Breguet School and Supa\u00e9ro. At the latter school, Bloch was classmates with a Russian student named Mikhail Gurevich, who would later be instrumental in the creation of the MiG aircraft series.[2]\n Bloch worked at the French Aeronautics Research Laboratory at Chalais-Meudon[2] during World War I and invented a type of aircraft propeller subsequently used by the French army during the conflict. In 1916, with Henry Potez and Louis Coroller, he formed a company, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tudes A\u00e9ronautiques, to produce the SEA series of fighters.[4]\n In 1928, Bloch founded the aircraft company Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Avions Marcel Bloch, which produced its first aircraft in 1930.[2] In 1935, Bloch and Henry Potez entered into an agreement to buy Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 A\u00e9rienne Bordelaise (SAB).[citation needed] In 1936, the company was nationalized as the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Constructions A\u00e9ronautiques du Sud Ouest (SNCASO). Bloch agreed to become the delegated administrator of the Minister for Air.[5]\n During the occupation of France by Nazi Germany during World War II, France's aviation industry was virtually disbanded,[6] other than the compulsory manufacturing, assembly and servicing of German designs. In October 1940, Bloch refused to collaborate with the German occupiers at Bordeaux-A\u00e9ronautique and was imprisoned by the Vichy government.\n In 1944, the Nazis deported Bloch to the Buchenwald concentration camp,[2] as punishment for refusing to co-operate with their regime. He was tortured, beaten and held in solitary confinement. In the meantime, his wife was interned near Paris. Bloch was detained at Buchenwald until it was liberated on 11 April 1945. By the time of his return to Paris, he was crippled to such an extent that he could barely walk. He was advised by his doctors to settle his affairs, as they did not expect him to recover his health. [2]\n After the war, he changed his name from Bloch to Bloch-Dassault and in 1949 to Dassault. This name was the nom de guerre used by his brother, General Darius Paul Bloch, when he served in the French resistance,[2] and is derived from char d'assaut, French for \"tank\".[note 1] In 1971, Dassault acquired Breguet, forming Avions Marcel Dassault\u2013Breguet Aviation (AMD\u2013BA).\n In 1919, Bloch married Madeleine Minckes, the daughter of a wealthy Jewish family of furniture dealers.[7] They had two sons, Claude and Serge. After changing his name to Dassault, he converted to Roman Catholicism in 1950.[5][8][2]\n In July 1952, Dassault acquired the Paris landmark buildings now known as H\u00f4tel Marcel Dassault, dating from 1844,[9]\nat nos. 7 and 9 rond-point des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es (at the corner of the avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and avenue Montaigne), from the Sabatier d'Espeyran family.[10] The building at no. 7 has been used since 2002 by the auction house Artcurial, which had further alterations made under the direction of architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte.[9] While no. 7 has been sold, no. 9  is still used by the Groupe Industriel Marcel Dassault.\n In 1973, Dassault was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame.[11]\n Dassault died at Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1986 and was buried at the Passy Cemetery in the 16th arrondissement of Paris.\n Serge Dassault, Marcel's younger son, became CEO of Avions Marcel Dassault, which was restructured as Groupe Industriel Marcel Dassault, reflecting its broader interests. In 1990, the aviation division was renamed Dassault Aviation.\n In 1991, the rond-point des Champs-Elys\u00e9es in Paris was renamed the rond-point des Champs-Elys\u00e9es-Marcel-Dassault in his honor.\n In The Adventures of Tintin book Flight 714 to Sydney, Dassault is parodied as the aircraft construction tycoon Laszlo Carreidas \u2013 \"the millionaire who never laughs\" \u2013 who offers Tintin, Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus his personal jet, the Carreidas 160, to travel to Sydney.[12]\n ", "tags": ["1892 births", "1986 deaths", "Businesspeople from Paris", "Politicians from Paris", "Dassault family", "French Jews", "French Roman Catholics", "Converts to Roman Catholicism from Judaism", "Rally of the French People politicians", "National Centre of Social Republicans politicians", "Union for the New Republic politicians", "Union of Democrats for the Republic politicians", "Rally for the Republic politicians", "Deputies of the 2nd National Assembly of the French Fourth Republic", "French Senators of the Fourth Republic", "Senators of Oise", "Deputies of the 1st National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic", "Deputies of the 2nd National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic", "Deputies of the 3rd National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic", "Deputies of the 4th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic", "Deputies of the 5th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic", "Deputies of the 6th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic", "Deputies of the 7th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic", "Deputies of the 8th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic", "Grand Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "French aerospace engineers", "Businesspeople in aviation", "French industrialists", "French inventors", "Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet alumni", "Supa\u00e9ro alumni", "Buchenwald concentration camp survivors", "Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal winners", "Burials at Passy Cemetery", "20th-century inventors", "Jewish inventors", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Harv and Sfn no-target errors", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from October 2016", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "French aircraft industrialist (1892\u20131986)\nFor the World War I flying ace, see Marcel Bloch (aviator).\nMarcel DassaultBornMarcel Ferdinand Bloch[1](1892-01-22)22 January 1892Paris, FranceDied17 April 1986(1986-04-17) (aged\u00a094)Neuilly-sur-Seine, FranceResting placePassy Cemetery in ParisEducationLyc\u00e9e CondorcetAlma\u00a0materBreguet School[2]  Supa\u00e9roOccupationEngineer and industrialistSpouse(s)Madeleine MinckesChildrenClaude DassaultSerge DassaultRelativesDarius Paul Dassault (brother)AwardsDaniel Guggenheim Medal (1976)\nMarcel Dassault (born Marcel Ferdinand Bloch;[1] 22 January 1892 \u2013 17 April 1986) was a French engineer and industrialist who spent his career in aircraft manufacturing.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Personal life\n4 Death and legacy\n5 In popular culture\n6 Notes\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\n Marcel Bloch, c. 1912\nBorn on 22 January 1892 in Paris, he was the youngest of the four children of Adolphe Bloch, a doctor, and his wife No\u00e9mie Allatini.[2][3] His parents were Jewish.\nHe was educated at Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet in Paris.
