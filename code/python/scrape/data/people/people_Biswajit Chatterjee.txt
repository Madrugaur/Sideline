{"name": "Biswajit Chatterjee", "content": "\n Biswajit Chatterjee (born 14 December 1936), known mononymously as Biswajit, is an Indian actor, producer, director, singer and politician known for his work in Hindi and Bengali cinema.[1][2]\n After films in Calcutta including  Mayamrigo (1960) and Dui Bhai (1961), Biswajit relocated to Bombay. In 1962, he performed in the film Bees Saal Baad, which was followed by Kohraa, Bin Badal Barsat, Majboor, Kaise Kahoon and Paisa Ya Pyaar.\n His filmography includes Mere Sanam (1965), Shehnai, Aasra (1964), Night in London, Yeh Raat Phir Naa Aaygi (1966), April Fool (1964), Kismat (1968), Do Kaliyan (1968), Ishq Par Zor Nahin and Sharaarat (1972). He was usually paired with notable actresses such as Asha Parekh, Waheeda Rehman, Mumtaz, Mala Sinha and Rajshree.\n Biswajit appeared in Rekha's debut film Anjana Safar (1969) (later re-titled Do Shikaari). Though Anjana Safar was blocked by the censors and not released until 10 years later, a scene from the film which shows him kissing Rekha appeared on the pages of the Asian edition of Life magazine.[3] Rekha had complained that during filming of one of the romantic scenes, Biswajit unexpectedly smooched her for 5 minutes against her will, and the entire crew started cheering and whistling while she was in tears.[4]\n Between acting in Bollywood movies, Biswajit has returned to Calcutta to act in Bengali films as well. Among them are  Chowringhee (1968) and Garh Nasimpur with Uttam Kumar and Kuheli and much later, Srimaan Prithviraj (1973), Jai Baba Taraknath (1977) and  Amar Geeti  (1983).\n Apart from acting, Biswajeet also sings and performs in concerts. In the 1970s, he cut a disc of two Bengali modern numbers Tomar Chokher Kajole and Jay Jay Din, both composed by Salil Choudhury.\n In 1975, Biswajit produced and directed his own film, Kahte Hai Mujhko Raja. The film besides him starred Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Shatrughan Sinha, and Rekha. He had done one film Anjana Safar with Rekha previously. R.D. Burman composed the music. Later, he went back to acting. He will make a film on Netaji Subash Chandra Bose's life (in Hindi, English and Bengali) and will act in a new untitled Hindi film (murder mystery) with his younger daughter actress Prima Chatterjee.[5] He has also acted in a Hindi Stage Play, Ulta Seedha, produced directed written by wife Ira Chatterjee. In the play, he acted with his daughter Prima.\n In the 2014 general elections, Biswajit contested from New Delhi as an All India Trinamool Congress candidate. He finished 7th, securing only 909 votes.[6][7]\n In 2019, he joined Bharatiya Janata Party.[7]\n Biswajit has a son and a daughter by his first wife, the late Ratna Chatterjee. His son Prosenjit and elder daughter Pallavi Chatterjee are also actors in the Bengali Film Industry. Biswajit lives in Mumbai with his second wife, Ira Chatterjee who is producer, director, writer of stage plays and is owner of Dream Theatre. Their younger daughter, Prima Chatterjee is a film actress, theatre actress and a dance performer.\n ", "tags": ["Male actors from Kolkata", "Bengali male actors", "Indian male film actors", "Male actors in Hindi cinema", "Living people", "Male actors from Mumbai", "Candidates in the 2014 Indian general election", "1936 births", "All India Trinamool Congress politicians", "20th-century Indian male actors", "CS1 Hindi-language sources (hi)", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from February 2016", "Use Indian English from February 2016", "All Wikipedia articles written in Indian English", "BLP articles lacking sources from July 2012", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with hCards", "Commons link from Wikidata", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "Indian film actor, producer, director and politician\n\n\nThis biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.
