{"name": "Marcel Riesz", "content": "Marcel Riesz (Hungarian: Riesz Marcell [\u02c8ri\u02d0s \u02c8m\u0252rt\u0361s\u025bll]; 16 November 1886 \u2013 4 September 1969) was a Hungarian mathematician, known for work on summation methods, potential theory, and other parts of analysis, as well as number theory, partial differential equations, and Clifford algebras. He spent most of his career in Lund (Sweden).\n Marcel is the younger brother of Frigyes Riesz, who was also an important mathematician and at times they worked together (see F. and M. Riesz theorem).\n Marcel Riesz was born in Gy\u0151r, Austria-Hungary; he was the younger brother of the mathematician Frigyes Riesz. He obtained his PhD at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University under the supervision of Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r. In 1911, he moved to Sweden upon the invitation of G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler. From 1911 to 1925 he taught at Stockholms h\u00f6gskola (now Stockholm University). From 1926 to 1952 he was professor at Lund University. After retiring, he spent 10 years at universities in the United States. He returned to Lund in 1962, and died there in 1969.[1][2]\n Riesz was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1936.[1]\n The work of Riesz as a student of Fej\u00e9r in Budapest was devoted to trigonometric series:\n One of his results states that, if\n and if the Fejer means of the series tend to zero, then all the coefficients an and bn are zero.[3]\n His results on summability of trigonometric series include a generalisation of Fej\u00e9r's theorem to Ces\u00e0ro means of arbitrary order.[4] He also studied the summability of power and Dirichlet series, and coauthored a book Hardy & Riesz (1915) on the latter with G.H. Hardy.[3]\n In 1916, he introduced the Riesz interpolation formula for trigonometric polynomials, which allowed him to give a new proof of Bernstein's inequality.[5]\n He also introduced the Riesz function Riesz(x), and showed that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the bound {{{1}}} as x \u2192 \u221e, for any \u03b5 > 0.[6]\n Together with his brother Frigyes Riesz, he proved the F. and M. Riesz theorem, which implies, in particular, that if \u03bc is a complex measure on the unit circle such that\n then the variation |\u03bc| of \u03bc and the Lebesgue measure on the circle are mutually absolutely continuous.[5][7]\n Part of the analytic work of Riesz in the 1920s used methods of functional analysis.\n In the early 1920s, he worked on the moment problem, to which he introduced the operator-theoretic approach by proving the Riesz extension theorem (which predated the closely related Hahn\u2013Banach theorem).[8][9]\n Later, he devised an interpolation theorem to show that the Hilbert transform is a bounded operator in Lp (1 < p < \u221e). The generalisation of the interpolation theorem by his student Olaf Thorin is now known as the Riesz\u2013Thorin theorem.[2][10]\n Riesz also established, independently of Andrey Kolmogorov, what is now called the Kolmogorov\u2013Riesz compactness criterion in Lp: a subset K\u00a0\u2282Lp(Rn) is precompact if and only if the following three conditions hold: (a) K is bounded;\n (b) for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists R > 0 so that\n for every f \u2208 K;\n (c) for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists \u03c1 > 0 so that\n for every y \u2208 Rn with |y|\u00a0<\u00a0\u03c1, and every f \u2208 K.[11]\n After 1930, the interests of Riesz shifted to potential theory and partial differential equations. He made use of \"generalised potentials\", generalisations of the  Riemann\u2013Liouville integral.[2] In particular, Riesz discovered the Riesz potential, a generalisation of the Riemann\u2013Liouville integral to dimension higher than one.[1]\n In the 1940s and 1950s, Riesz worked on Clifford algebras. His 1958 lecture notes, the complete version of which was only published in 1993 (Riesz (1993)), were dubbed by the physicist David Hestenes \"the midwife of the rebirth\" of Clifford algebras.[12]\n Riesz's doctoral students in Stockholm include Harald Cram\u00e9r and Einar Carl Hille.[1] In Lund, Riesz supervised the theses of Otto Frostman, Lars H\u00f6rmander, and Olaf Thorin.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1886 births", "1969 deaths", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "20th-century Hungarian people", "20th-century Swedish people", "Swedish mathematicians", "Mathematical analysts", "Functional analysts", "Measure theorists", "People connected to Lund University", "People from Lund", "Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences", "Hungarian emigrants to Sweden", "People from Gy\u0151r", "Swedish Jews", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hungarian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Marcel RieszRiesz c. 1930.Born(1886-11-16)16 November 1886Gy\u0151r, Austria-HungaryDied4 September 1969(1969-09-04) (aged\u00a082)Lund, SwedenNationalityHungarianKnown\u00a0forRiesz\u2013Thorin theoremM.
