R. G. D. Allen did the most to propagate Slutsky's work on consumer theory in published papers in 1936 and 1950.[3]\nVincent Barnett argues:\n\n\"A good case can be made for the notion that Slutsky is the most famous of all Russian economists, even more well-known [than] N. D. Kondratiev, L. V. Kantorovich, or Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky.  There are eponymous concepts such as the Slutsky equation, the Slutsky diamond, the Slutsky matrix, and the Slutsky-Yule effect, and a journals-literature search conducted on his name for the years 1980-1995 yielded seventy-nine articles directly using some aspect of Slutsky\u2019s work... Moreover, many microeconomics textbooks contain prominent mention of Slutsky\u2019s contribution to the theory of consumer behavior, most notably the Slutsky equation, christened by John Hicks as the \u2018Fundamental Equation of Value Theory'. Slutsky\u2019s work is thus an integral part of contemporary mainstream economics and econometrics, a claim that cannot really be made by any other Soviet economist, perhaps even by any other Russian economist.\"[3]\nThe Slutsky Effect[edit]\nIn the 1920s Slutsky turned to working on probability theory and stochastic processes, but in 1927 he published his second famous article on economic theory, 'The Summation of Random Causes as a Source of Cyclical Processes'.[4] This showed that it was possible for apparently cyclic behaviour to emerge as the result of random shocks to the economy if the latter were modelled using a stable stochastic difference equation with certain technical properties.[5] This opened up a new approach to business cycle theory by hypothesising that the interaction of chance events could generate periodicity when none existed initially.[3]\n\nMathematical statistics work[edit]\nSlutsky's later work was principally in probability theory and the theory of stochastic processes. He is generally credited for the result known as Slutsky's theorem. In 1928 he was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in Bologna.[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ E.E.
