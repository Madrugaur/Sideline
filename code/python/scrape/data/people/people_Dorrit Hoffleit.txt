{"name": "Dorrit Hoffleit", "content": "Ellen Dorrit Hoffleit (March 12, 1907 \u2013 April 9, 2007)[1] was an American senior research astronomer at Yale University.  She is most widely known for her work in variable stars, astrometry, spectroscopy, meteors, and the Bright Star Catalog, as well as her mentorship of many young women and generations of astronomers.[2]\n Hoffleit's interest in astronomy started with the 1919 Perseid meteor shower that she saw with her mother.[3]\nShe earned her B.A. in 1928, graduating cum laude in mathematics, before working for the  Harvard College Observatory searching for variable stars.[4]\nShe went on to earn her Ph.D. in astronomy from Radcliffe College in 1938[5] and was hired as an astronomer at Harvard in 1948. She remained there until moving to Yale in 1956, where she stayed until her 1975 retirement.[6]\n At Yale she followed in the footsteps of Ida Barney, taking over her astrometric work, and of whom she later wrote \"To know [her] was a pleasure, inspiration, and privilege, both at work and socially.\"[7] \nHoffleit also served as director of the Maria Mitchell Observatory on Nantucket Island from 1957 to 1978, where she ran summer programs (May\u2013October) for more than 100 students, many of whom went on to successful careers in astronomy.[2]\nIn her final years at Yale, Hoffleit was tasked with teaching the most basic course on astronomy to undergraduates.  Her passionate lectures in Davies Hall, usually with over 100 students, inspired and awed them.  She thus engendered a lifelong interest in astronomy to young men and women, many of whom were simply satisfying a prerequisite to their undergraduate degrees.\n During the mid 1950s, Hoffleit consulted for the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratories in \"Doppler reductions.\"[8]\n She was the author of the Bright Star Catalogue, a compendium of information on the 9,110 brightest stars in the sky; she also co-authored The General Catalogue of Trigonometric Stellar Parallaxes, containing precise distance measurements to 8,112 stars, information critical to understanding the kinematics of the Milky Way galaxy and the evolution of the solar neighborhood. \nWith Harlan J. Smith, Hoffleit discovered the optical variability of the first-discovered quasar 3C 273.[9]\n In 1988, Hoffleit was awarded the George Van Biesbroeck Prize by the American Astronomical Society for a lifetime of service to astronomy. She turned 100 on March 12, 2007, and died a month later from complications of cancer.[10]\n ", "tags": ["1907 births", "2007 deaths", "People from Florence, Alabama", "American astronomers", "American centenarians", "Women astronomers", "Radcliffe College alumni", "Harvard University faculty", "Yale University faculty", "20th-century American women scientists", "20th-century American scientists", "Harvard College Observatory people", "Women centenarians", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American astronomer\nDorrit HoffleitBorn(1907-03-12)March 12, 1907Florence, AlabamaDiedApril 9, 2007(2007-04-09) (aged\u00a0100)New Haven, ConnecticutNationalityAmericanOther\u00a0namesEllen Dorrit HoffleitAlma\u00a0materRadcliffe CollegeKnown\u00a0forBright Star CatalogAwardsCaroline Wilby PrizeGeorge Van Biesbroeck Prize (1988)Scientific careerFieldsAstronomyInstitutionsHarvard College Observatory, Ballistic Research Laboratory, Harvard University, Yale University, Maria Mitchell ObservatoryThesisOn the Spectroscopic Determination of Absolute Magnitudes, With Application to the Southern Stars of Types Later than A.\u00a0(1938)Doctoral advisorBart Bok\n\nEllen Dorrit Hoffleit (March 12, 1907 \u2013 April 9, 2007)[1] was an American senior research astronomer at Yale University.
