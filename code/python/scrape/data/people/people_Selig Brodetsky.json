{"name": "Selig Brodetsky", "content": "\n Selig Brodetsky, \u05d6\u05dc\u05d9\u05d2 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3\u05e6\u05e7 (10 February 1888 \u2013 18 May 1954)[1] was a Russian-born English mathematician, a member of the World Zionist Executive, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and the second president of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n Brodetsky was born in Olviopol (now Pervomaisk) in the Kherson Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine) , the second of 13 children born to Akiva Brodetsky (the beadle of the local synagogue) and Adel (Prober). As a child, he witnessed the murder of his uncle in a pogrom. In 1894, the family followed Akiva to the East End of London, to where he had migrated a year earlier. Brodetsky attended the Jews' Free School, where he excelled at his studies. He was awarded a scholarship, which enabled him to attend the Central Foundation Boys' School of London[2] and subsequently, in 1905, Trinity College, Cambridge.\n In 1908, he completed his studies with highest honours being Senior Wrangler, to the distress of the conservative press, which was forced to recognise that a son of immigrants surpassed all the local students. The Newton scholarship enabled him to study at Leipzig University where he was awarded a doctorate in 1913. His dissertation dealt with the gravitational field.\n In 1919, he married Manya Berenblum, whose family had recently emigrated from Belgium, where her father had been a diamond merchant in Antwerp. She bore him two children, Paul and Adele, in 1924 and 1927.\n In 1914, Brodetsky was appointed a Lecturer in Applied Mathematics at the University of Bristol.[3][4][5] During the First World War he was employed as an advisor to the British company developing periscopes for submarines.\n In 1919, Brodetsky became a Lecturer at the University of Leeds.  Five years later he was appointed Professor of Applied Mathematics at Leeds where he remained until 1948.  Much of his work concerned aeronautics and mechanics of aeroplanes.  He was the head of the mathematics department of the University of Leeds from 1946-1948. He was active in the Association of University Teachers, serving as president in 1935\u20131936.\n Brodetsky became the second president of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1949, preceded by Sir Leon Simon, serving until 1952, and followed by Benjamin Mazar (1953 to 1961), at a time when the University was going through a rocky period, eventually having to abandon its campus on Mount Scopus.[6] He attempted to overhaul the structure of the University but he soon became embroiled in bitter struggles with the  University Senate, which interfered in his academic and bureaucratic work. Apparently, Brodetsky thought that he was going to take up a position similar to that of Vice-Chancellor of an English university but many in Jerusalem saw the position as essentially an honorary one, like the Chancellor of an English university. This struggle affected his health and in 1952 he decided to resign his post and return to England.\n He was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, Royal Aeronautical Society and Institute of Physics.\n His sister Rachel married Rabbi Solomon Mestel; their son is astronomer and astrophysicist Leon Mestel.\n ", "tags": ["1888 births", "1954 deaths", "People from Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv Oblast", "People from Kherson Governorate", "Ukrainian Jews", "Emigrants from the Russian Empire to the United Kingdom", "British people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent", "Mathematicians from London", "People educated at JFS (school)", "People educated at Central Foundation Boys' School", "Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge", "Leipzig University alumni", "20th-century British mathematicians", "British mathematicians", "Jewish scientists", "Fellows of the Royal Aeronautical Society", "Senior Wranglers", "Leaders of British trade unions", "British expatriates in Israel", "Academics of the University of Bristol", "Academics of the University of Leeds", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty", "British Zionists", "Presidents of the Board of Deputies of British Jews", "Ukrainian-Jewish emigrants to the United Kingdom", "Presidents of universities in Israel", "Use dmy dates from July 2013", "Articles with hCards", "Articles needing additional references from October 2019", "All articles needing additional references", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nSelig BrodestskyBorn10 February 1888Olviopol, Kherson Governorate, Russian EmpireDied18 May 1954(1954-05-18) (aged\u00a066)London, UKEducationJews' Free SchoolAlma\u00a0materTrinity College, CambridgeOccupationMathematicianSpouse(s)Manya BerenblumChildren1 son, 1 daughterParent(s)Akiva BrodetskyAdel ProberRelativesSolomon Mestel (brother-in-law)Leon Mestel (nephew)\nSelig Brodetsky, \u05d6\u05dc\u05d9\u05d2 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3\u05e6\u05e7 (10 February 1888 \u2013 18 May 1954)[1] was a Russian-born English mathematician, a member of the World Zionist Executive, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and the second president of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n2 Academic career\n3 Education\n4 Career\n5 Other posts\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nBackground[edit]\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.
