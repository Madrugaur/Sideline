She and the rest of the family moved to Chesapeake, Missouri in 1906 after the death of her father.[1] She received a bachelor's degree from Baylor University in Texas with distinction,[2] worked for a year as a mathematics teacher,[1] and completed a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Iowa in 1929,[2] under the supervision of Edward Wilson Chittenden. Her dissertation was The Complete Existential Theory of Eight Fundamental Properties of Topological Spaces.[3] She earned both degrees at the same time as her younger brother, Neal, who became a professor of mathematics at Smith College.[2] She became the first woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics at the University of Iowa, and (with Winifred Asprey, Barbara Beechler, and Kathryn Powell Ellis) one of only four who did so before 1960.[4]\n McCoy became professor and head of the mathematics department at Belhaven College in Mississippi in 1929, and \nchaired the Louisiana\u2013Mississippi Section of the Mathematical Association of America in 1937 and 1938.[1] In 1949 she became professor of mathematics and chair of the division of physical and biological sciences at Wayland Baptist College.
