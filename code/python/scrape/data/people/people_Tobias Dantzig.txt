He worked for a time as a lumberjack, road worker, and house painter in Oregon, until returning to academia at the encouragement of Reed College mathematician Frank Griffin.[3] Dantzig received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Indiana University in 1917, while working as a professor there.[3][4]  He later taught at Johns Hopkins, Columbia University, and the University of Maryland.\n Dantzig died in Los Angeles in 1956.
