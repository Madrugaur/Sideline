{"name": "T. O.

After he graduated school at the age of 18, Engset was admitted to the telegraph school in Stavanger in 1883. He received his certificate in a year and took employment. In his spare time he continued his studies, graduating in 1892 but continuing his university studies. Engset received an M.Sc. in physics and mathematics (1894) at University of Oslo, after which he worked at Televerket as office worker, traffic analyst and later at age 65 director general (1921-22 (acting), 1930\u201335).\n[2]\n He developed the Engset formula (1915) before the breakthroughs of\nA.
