She received the Lomonosov Gold Medal in 2002. She is the author of more than two hundred scientific works, among which are six monographs.\n Ladyzhenskaya was born and grew up in the small town of Kologriv, the daughter of a mathematics teacher who is credited with her early inspiration and love of mathematics.[1] The artist Gennady Ladyzhensky was her grandfather's brother, also born in this town. In 1937 her father, Aleksandr Ivanovich Lad\u00fdzhenski, was arrested by the NKVD and executed as an \"enemy of the people\".[1]\n Ladyzhenskaya completed high school in 1939, unlike her older sisters who weren't permitted to do the same. She was not admitted to the Leningrad State University due to her father's status and  attended a pedagogical institute. After the German invasion of June 1941, she taught school in Kologriv. She was eventually admitted to Moscow State University in 1943 and graduated in 1947.[2]\n She began teaching in the Physics department of the university in 1950 and defended her PhD there, in 1951, under Sergei Sobolev and Vladimir Smirnov. She received a second doctorate from the Moscow State University in 1953. In 1954, she joined the mathematical physics laboratory of the Steklov Institute and became its head in 1961.[2][3]\n Ladyzhenskaya had a love of arts and storytelling, counting writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and poet Anna Akhmatova among her friends. She was once a member of the city council, and engaged in philanthropic activities, repeatedly risking her personal safety and career to aid people opposed to the Soviet regime. Ladyzhenskaya suffered from various eye problems in her later years and relied on special pencils to do her work. \n Two days before a trip to Florida, she passed away in her sleep in Russia on 12 January 2004.[4]\n Ladyzhenskaya is known for her work on partial differential equations (especially Hilbert's nineteenth problem) and fluid dynamics.[5] She provided the first rigorous proofs of the convergence of a finite difference method for the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.[6]\n She analyzed the regularity of parabolic equations, with Vsevolod A. Solonnikov and her student Nina Ural\u2019tseva, and the regularity of quasilinear elliptic equations.[7]\n She wrote a student thesis under Ivan Petrovsky[8] and was on the shortlist for the 1958 Fields Medal,[9] ultimately awarded to Klaus Roth and Ren\u00e9 Thom.\n ", "tags": ["1922 births", "2004 deaths", "People from Kologrivsky District", "20th-century Russian mathematicians", "20th-century women scientists", "Mathematical analysts", "Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Full Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences", "Fluid dynamicists", "PDE theorists", "Recipients of the Lomonosov Gold Medal", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Moscow State University alumni", "Saint Petersburg State University alumni", "Steklov Institute of Mathematics faculty", "Harv and Sfn multiple-target errors", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from January 2021", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Russian mathematician\n\n\nOlga LadyzhenskayaBornOlga Aleksandrovna Ladyzhenskaya(1922-03-07)7 March 1922Kologriv, Russian SFSRDied12 January 2004(2004-01-12) (aged\u00a081)Saint Petersburg, RussiaNationalitySoviet\u2013RussianAlma\u00a0materMoscow UniversityKnown\u00a0forFinite difference method for the Navier\u2013Stokes equations., work on Hilbert's nineteenth problem, Ladyzhenskaya's inequalityAwardsLomonosov Gold Medal (2002)Scientific careerFieldsPartial differential equationsInstitutionsSaint Petersburg UniversityDoctoral advisorIvan PetrovskySergei SobolevNotable studentsNina UraltsevaLudvig FaddeevVladimir Buslaev\n\nOlga Aleksandrovna Ladyzhenskaya (Russian: \u00d3\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041b\u0430\u0434\u044b\u0301\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f; 7 March 1922 \u2013 12 January 2004) was a  Russian  mathematician who worked on partial differential equations, fluid dynamics, and the finite difference method for the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.
