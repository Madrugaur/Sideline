{"name": "George David Birkhoff", "content": "George David Birkhoff (March 21, 1884 \u2013 November 12, 1944) was an American mathematician best known for what is now called the ergodic theorem. Birkhoff was one of the most important leaders in American mathematics in his generation, and during his time he was considered by many to be the preeminent American mathematician.[1]\n The George D. Birkhoff House, his residence in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has been designated a National Historic Landmark.\n He was born in Overisel Township, Michigan,[2] the son of David Birkhoff and Jane Gertrude Droppers.[3]   The mathematician Garrett Birkhoff (1911\u20131996) was his son.\n Birkhoff obtained his A.B. and A.M. from Harvard University. He completed his Ph.D. in 1907, on differential equations, at the University of Chicago. While E. H. Moore was his supervisor, he was most influenced by the writings of Henri Poincar\u00e9. After teaching at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and Princeton University, he taught at Harvard from 1912 until his death.\n In 1923, he was awarded the inaugural B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize by the American Mathematical Society for his paper in 1917 containing, among other things, what is now called the Birkhoff curve shortening process.[4]\n He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in Paris, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences,[5] and the London and Edinburgh Mathematical Societies.\n The George David Birkhoff Prize in applied mathematics is awarded jointly by the American Mathematical Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in his honor.\n In 1912, attempting to solve the four color problem, Birkhoff introduced the chromatic polynomial. Even though this line of attack did not prove fruitful, the polynomial itself became an important object of study in algebraic graph theory.\n In 1913, he proved Poincar\u00e9's \"Last Geometric Theorem,\" a special case of the three-body problem, a result that made him world-famous. In 1927, he published his Dynamical Systems. He wrote on the foundations of relativity and quantum mechanics, publishing (with R. E. Langer) the monograph Relativity and Modern Physics in 1923. In 1923, Birkhoff also proved that the Schwarzschild geometry is the unique spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein field equations. A consequence is that black holes are not merely a mathematical curiosity, but could result from any spherical star having sufficient mass.\n Birkhoff's most durable result has been his 1931 discovery of what is now called the ergodic theorem. Combining insights from physics on the ergodic hypothesis with measure theory, this theorem solved, at least in principle, a fundamental problem of statistical mechanics. The ergodic theorem has also had repercussions for dynamics, probability theory, group theory, and functional analysis. He also worked on number theory, the Riemann\u2013Hilbert problem, and the four colour problem. He proposed an axiomatization of Euclidean geometry different from Hilbert's (see Birkhoff's axioms); this work culminated in his text Basic Geometry (1941).\n In his later years, Birkhoff published two curious works. His 1933 Aesthetic Measure proposed a mathematical theory of aesthetics.[6] While writing this book, he spent a year studying the art, music and poetry of various cultures around the world. His 1938 Electricity as a Fluid combined his ideas on philosophy and science. His 1943 theory of gravitation is also puzzling since Birkhoff knew (but didn't seem to mind) that his theory allows as sources only matter which is a perfect fluid in which the speed of sound must equal the speed of light.\n Albert Einstein and Norbert Wiener, among others, accused[7][8][9] Birkhoff of advocating anti-Semitic hiring practices. During the 1930s, when many Jewish mathematicians fled Europe and tried to obtain jobs in the USA, Birkhoff is alleged to have influenced the hiring process at American institutions to exclude Jews. Birkhoff's anti-Semitic views and remarks are well-documented,[10] but Saunders Mac Lane has argued that Birkhoff's efforts were motivated less by animus towards Jews than by a desire to find jobs for home-grown American mathematicians.[11]\n However, Birkhoff took a particular liking to certain Jewish mathematicians, including Stanislaw Ulam. Gian-Carlo Rota writes: \"Like other persons rumored to be anti-Semitic, he would occasionally feel the urge to shower his protective instincts on some good-looking young Jew. Ulam's sparkling manners were diametrically opposite to Birkhoff's hard-working, aggressive, touchy personality. Birkhoff tried to keep Ulam at Harvard, but his colleagues balked at the idea.\"[12]\n \n ", "tags": ["1884 births", "1944 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Harvard University alumni", "University of Chicago alumni", "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison faculty", "Princeton University faculty", "Harvard University faculty", "Topologists", "American relativity theorists", "Presidents of the American Mathematical Society", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences", "Mathematicians from Michigan", "Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from October 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Use mdy dates from November 2011", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nNot to be confused with his son, the mathematician Garrett Birkhoff.\nGeorge David BirkhoffGeorge David BirkhoffBorn(1884-03-21)March 21, 1884Overisel Township, MichiganDiedNovember 12, 1944(1944-11-12) (aged\u00a060)Cambridge, MassachusettsNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materHarvard UniversityUniversity of ChicagoKnown\u00a0forErgodic theoremBirkhoff's axiomsAwardsB\u00f4cher Memorial Prize (1923)Newcomb Cleveland Prize (1926)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsHarvard UniversityYale UniversityPrinceton UniversityRadcliffe CollegeDoctoral advisorE.

Birkhoff, an American of Dutch origin, was instrumental in preventing Jewish mathematicians from being hired. It may seem counterintuitive that a Harvard professor would shed light on this shameful legacy in a book published by the university\u2019s own press, but Yau is a veteran whistle-blower who has frequently criticized academic corruption and educational abuses in his native China.\n\n^ Feuer, Lewis (1976). \"Recollections of Harry Austryn Wolfson\" (PDF).
