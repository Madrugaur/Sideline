{"name": "Henry Potez", "content": "Henry Potez  (M\u00e9aulte, 30 September 1891 \u2013 Paris, 9 November 1981[1]) was a French aircraft industrialist.\n He studied in the French Aeronautics School Supa\u00e9ro. With Marcel Dassault, he was the inventor of the Potez-Bloch propeller which, after 1917, have been set on most of all Allied planes of World War I.\n In 1919, he founded his own company, Aviations Potez, that, between the wars, built many planes and seaplanes, in factories which were at that time considered the most modern in the world. He bought the Alessandro Anzani company in 1923. Many Potez planes, such as the Potez 25, 39, 54, 62, 63, were an international success, setting world records.\n Over the course of twenty years, 7,000 planes left the production lines. Forty prototypes were designed and more than twenty passed to production - this was remarkable at that time.\n In 1936, his factories, considered to be strategic, were nationalised by the French Front populaire government.\n After the Second World War, the Potez engineering department designed the Magister, a two-seat two engine trainer aircraft, which was a big success. Launched in 1952 and better known as Fouga Magister, this aircraft was used by many Air Forces.\n ", "tags": ["French aerospace engineers", "Supa\u00e9ro alumni", "1891 births", "1981 deaths", "Businesspeople in aviation", "French businesspeople", "French inventors", "20th-century inventors", "20th-century businesspeople", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with infoboxes completely from Wikidata", "Articles using Template Infobox person Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Henry PotezBornHenri Charles Alexandre Potez\u00a030 September 1891\u00a0M\u00e9aulte\u00a0Died9 November 1981\u00a0 (aged 90)16th arrondissement of Paris\u00a0\nHenry Potez  (M\u00e9aulte, 30 September 1891 \u2013 Paris, 9 November 1981[1]) was a French aircraft industrialist.\nHe studied in the French Aeronautics School Supa\u00e9ro.
