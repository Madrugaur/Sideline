Her dissertation, Dynamics of Lattice Systems, was supervised by Shui-Nee Chow.[7]\n After postdoctoral research at West Point and the Army Research Laboratory, she joined the faculty at New Jersey City University in 1998, and moved to Montclair State University in 2000.[8] In 2017, she returned to West Point as a professor.[4]\n Topics in Thomas's research have included a comparison of the effects of dieting and exercise on weight loss,[1] the effects of weight loss on pregnancy,[2] epidemiological approaches to obesity,[3] the use of biometric data to predict military training injuries,[9] and a statistical comparison of the body types of military recruits with Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.[5][10]\n In 2012 the New Jersey Section of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) gave Thomas their Award for Distinguished\nCollege or University Teaching of Mathematics.
