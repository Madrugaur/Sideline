{"name": "Eduardo Torroja", "content": "Eduardo Torroja y Miret, (27 August 1899 \u2013 15 June 1961) was a Spanish structural engineer and a pioneer in the design of concrete shell structures.\n Torroja was born in Madrid where he studied civil engineering.\n In 1923 Torroja began work for the Hidrocivil company, headed by the engineer Jos\u00e9 Eugenio Ribera. \nHe planned and directed various types of projects, including the foundations of bridge piers, bridges, water supply and sanitation works, and various urban buildings.[1]\nTorroja's first large project was the Tempul cable-stayed aqueduct (1926) in Guadalete, Jerez de la Frontera, in which he used pre-stressed girders.[2]\nIn 1928 he established his own office.[1]\n Modesto L\u00f3pez Otero, director for the Madrid University City (Ciudad Universitaria de Madrid) project, formed a diverse team of young architects to design the various buildings.\nTorroja joined the group in 1929. \nHe worked with Manuel S\u00e1nchez Arcas, sharing his interest in new architectural forms that rejected preconceived formulas.[1]\nThe first collaborative work of Torroja and Sanchez Arcas was the pavilion of the Construction Commission of the university city, completed in June 1931.[3]\nThey worked on the heating plant (Central T\u00e9rmica) and the clinical hospital for the university city.[4]\n S\u00e1nchez Arcas and Torroja designed an enclosed and semi-spherical shell for the 1932 Algeciras market hall.[5]\nThe 9 centimetres (3.5\u00a0in) thick concrete roof was 47.5 metres (156\u00a0ft) high, vaulted, supported on eight pillars.\nAs an engineering work it is considered Torroja's masterpiece.[6]\nS\u00e1nchez Arcas and Torroja founded the journal Hormig\u00f3n y Acero (Concrete and Steel).\nIn 1934 they founded the Instituto T\u00e9cnico de la Construcci\u00f3n y Edificaci\u00f3n (ITCE, Technical Institute of Construction and Building).[4]\nOther founding members were the architect Modesto L\u00f3pez Otero (1885\u20131962) and the engineers Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aguirre Gonzalo (1897\u20131988) and Alfonso Pe\u00f1a Boeuf (1888\u20131966). \nThe ITCE was a non-profit organization dedicated to developing and applying technical innovations in engineering civil structures.[7]\n In 1952, Eduardo Torroja \u2013\u00a0along with Andr\u00e9 Balency-B\u00e9ran, Emile Nenning, Louis Baes, Hubert H\u00fcsch and Georg W\u00e4stlund\u00a0\u2013 founded the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en du B\u00e9ton, which is now the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du B\u00e9ton. The Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en du B\u00e9ton sought to coordinate the research effort on structural concrete in Europe following the end of the Second World War.\n Eduardo Torroja designed the thin-shell water tower in Fedala[8] and the roof of the \"La Zarzuela\" racetrack in Madrid[9] in the form of a hyperboloid.\nHe also used steel with great \u00e9lan, as at the roof of the Football Stadium, Barcelona (1943). He designed innovative structures in numerous parts of the world, including Morocco and Latin America. His books include Philosophy of Structures (1958) and The Structures of Eduardo Torroja (1958).\n Torroja believed that a structure should reflect the personality of its designer. Some believe every specific twist and turn in a structure reflects an important event in one's life. Believing in the latter, Torroja developed new ways of looking at structures as well as ways to increase the strength of the structures without dimming aesthetics. Torroja illustrated an interest in forms of art that dwindled within most of his structures which often incorporated his visions.\n In the 1920s, Europe was left in ruins to struggle with economic and political recovery. Since Spain was short on steel supplies, Torroja had to pursue other materials. \nIn his search for new materials, Torroja became famous for his exploration of alternative uses for horse manure, which was found to be a strong and cheap in-cost material. Today, Torroja is renowned for his development of reinforced concrete.[10]\n ", "tags": ["Spanish architects", "Spanish engineers", "Structural engineers", "Bridge engineers", "Concrete pioneers", "Concrete shell structures", "1899 births", "1961 deaths", "Spanish civil engineers", "20th-century engineers", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "No local image but image on Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from May 2017", "All articles needing additional references", "CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Spanish structural engineer\nEduardo TorrojaBorn27 August 1899Died15 June 1961\u00a0(1961-06-16) (aged\u00a061)NationalitySpanishOccupationEngineerEngineering careerProjectsTempul cable-stayed aqueductSignificant advanceconcrete-shell structuresAwardsWilhelm Exner Medal, 1954\n\nEduardo Torroja y Miret, (27 August 1899 \u2013 15 June 1961) was a Spanish structural engineer and a pioneer in the design of concrete shell structures.\n\nContents\n\n1 Education\n2 Career\n3 Personal characteristics\n4 Socioeconomic and political environment\n5 References\n6 Sources\n7 Further reading\n8 External links\n\n\nEducation[edit]\nTorroja was born in Madrid where he studied civil engineering.\n\nCareer[edit]\n Ingeniero Torroja Market, Algeciras\nIn 1923 Torroja began work for the Hidrocivil company, headed by the engineer Jos\u00e9 Eugenio Ribera. \nHe planned and directed various types of projects, including the foundations of bridge piers, bridges, water supply and sanitation works, and various urban buildings.[1]\nTorroja's first large project was the Tempul cable-stayed aqueduct (1926) in Guadalete, Jerez de la Frontera, in which he used pre-stressed girders.[2]\nIn 1928 he established his own office.[1]\nModesto L\u00f3pez Otero, director for the Madrid University City (Ciudad Universitaria de Madrid) project, formed a diverse team of young architects to design the various buildings.\nTorroja joined the group in 1929. \nHe worked with Manuel S\u00e1nchez Arcas, sharing his interest in new architectural forms that rejected preconceived formulas.[1]\nThe first collaborative work of Torroja and Sanchez Arcas was the pavilion of the Construction Commission of the university city, completed in June 1931.[3]\nThey worked on the heating plant (Central T\u00e9rmica) and the clinical hospital for the university city.[4]\nS\u00e1nchez Arcas and Torroja designed an enclosed and semi-spherical shell for the 1932 Algeciras market hall.[5]\nThe 9 centimetres (3.5\u00a0in) thick concrete roof was 47.5 metres (156\u00a0ft) high, vaulted, supported on eight pillars.\nAs an engineering work it is considered Torroja's masterpiece.[6]\nS\u00e1nchez Arcas and Torroja founded the journal Hormig\u00f3n y Acero (Concrete and Steel).\nIn 1934 they founded the Instituto T\u00e9cnico de la Construcci\u00f3n y Edificaci\u00f3n (ITCE, Technical Institute of Construction and Building).[4]\nOther founding members were the architect Modesto L\u00f3pez Otero (1885\u20131962) and the engineers Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aguirre Gonzalo (1897\u20131988) and Alfonso Pe\u00f1a Boeuf (1888\u20131966). \nThe ITCE was a non-profit organization dedicated to developing and applying technical innovations in engineering civil structures.[7]\nIn 1952, Eduardo Torroja \u2013\u00a0along with Andr\u00e9 Balency-B\u00e9ran, Emile Nenning, Louis Baes, Hubert H\u00fcsch and Georg W\u00e4stlund\u00a0\u2013 founded the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en du B\u00e9ton, which is now the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du B\u00e9ton.
