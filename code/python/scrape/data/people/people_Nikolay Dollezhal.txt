In 1932-1943 he headed important manufacturing plants in Kiev, Leningrad and Sverdlovsk.\n In 1943, Dollezhal was appointed to lead the new Institute of Chemical Machinery in Moscow. In 1946, the Institute was assigned to the Soviet atomic project; his first reactors, graphite moderated types A and AI, produced Soviet plutonium used in Joe 1 nuclear test of 1949 and subsequent nuclear weapons deployment. After 1950, Dollezhal focused on nuclear marine propulsion. His first proposal, Type AM, was not practical for marine uses but became the core of the first nuclear power plant in Obninsk, commissioned in 1954. In the same year, he produced a viable draft of a light water submarine reactor.\n Dollezhal pioneered the concept of the pressurized water reactor, which led to numerous military and VVER-type civilian designs. In 1957 Dollezhal Institute launched their first dual-use (civilian energy and weapons-grade plutonium) powerplant, Type EI, and seven years later, the first truly industrial Beloyarsk Nuclear Power Station. All subsequent Soviet reactors (VVER, RBMK) also originated from his firm.\n ", "tags": ["1899 births", "2000 deaths", "Soviet nuclear physicists", "Russian centenarians", "Nuclear weapons program of the Soviet Union", "Soviet physicists", "20th-century physicists", "Bauman Moscow State Technical University alumni", "Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Full Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences", "Heroes of Socialist Labour", "Recipients of the Order \"For Merit to the Fatherland\", 2nd class", "Lenin Prize winners", "Stalin Prize winners", "Recipients of the USSR State Prize", "Recipients of the Order of Lenin", "Russian inventors", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Nikolay DollezhalBorn27 October\u00a0[O.S. 15 October]\u00a01899Zaporizhia Oblast, Russian Empire, Present-day UkraineDied20 November 2000(2000-11-20) (aged\u00a0101)Moscow, RussiaNationalitySovietCzechRussianCitizenshipSoviet UnionRussiaAlma\u00a0materBauman Moscow State Technical UniversityKnown\u00a0forSoviet atomic bomb projectFounder of the RBMK type nuclear reactornuclear marine propulsionAwardsOrder of Merit for the FatherlandHero of Socialist LabourScientific careerFieldsMechanical EngineeringInstitutionsInstitute of Chemical PhysicsMoscow State UniversitySternberg Astronomical Institute\n\nNikolay Antonovich Dollezhal (Russian: \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0414\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0301\u043b\u044c; 27 October\u00a0[O.S. 15 October]\u00a01899 \u2013 20 November 2000[1])[2] was a Soviet mechanical engineer of Czech descent, a key figure in Soviet atomic bomb project and chief designer of nuclear reactors from the first plutonium production reactor to the RBMK.\nBorn in Omelnik, Zaporizhia Oblast, in a family of Czech immigrants, Dollezhal graduated MVTU in 1923.[3] Until 1930, he worked in various design bureaus, but after a tour of Europe in 1929 he was arrested and spent a year and a half in prison, before being acquitted in January 1932.
