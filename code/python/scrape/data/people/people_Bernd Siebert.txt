{"name": "Bernd Siebert", "content": "Bernd Siebert (born 5 March 1964 in Berlin-Wilmersdorf) is a German mathematician who researches in algebraic geometry.\n Siebert studied mathematics starting 1984 at the University of Erlangen. In 1986, he changed to the University of Bonn and in 1987 to the University of G\u00f6ttingen where he finished his Diplom in 1989 under the supervision of Hans Grauert with distinction. He became Grauert's PhD student and assistant in G\u00f6ttingen. He received his PhD in 1992 (Faserzykelr\u00e4ume, geometrische Plattifikation und meromorphe \u00c4quivalenzrelationen). A stay at the Courant Institute followed in 1993\u201394 after which we went to Bochum. In 1997\u201398 he spent some time at the MIT as a visiting scholar before completing his habilitation in Bochum in 1998 (Gromov\u2013Witten invariants for general symplectic manifolds). As a DFG-Heisenberg Fellow, he went to the Universit\u00e4t Paris VI/Universit\u00e4t Paris VII from 2000 to 2002. From there, he was called to a professorship at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg in 2002. He moved on to the Universit\u00e4t Hamburg in 2008, and in 2011, he became the head of the Graduiertenkolleg Mathematics Inspired by String Theory and QFT. In 2018, Siebert joined the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin as a professor of mathematics[1] and holds the Sid W. Richardson Foundation Regents Chair in Mathematics #4.[2]\n In his research, Bernd Siebert contributed substantially to the theory of Gromov\u2013Witten invariants. Around 2002 by his insights in logarithmic geometry, he entered into an ongoing joint research program with Mark Gross. This generated a sequence of relevant papers that relate to Mirror Symmetry and tropical geometry.\n In 2014, jointly with Mark Gross, he became an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematics in Seoul for the section complex geometry (Local mirror symmetry in the tropics). Both of them were awarded the Clay Research Award in 2016.\n ", "tags": ["1964 births", "Living people", "21st-century German politicians", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences alumni", "20th-century German mathematicians", "People from Wilmersdorf", "University of Bonn alumni", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg alumni", "21st-century German mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\nBernd SiebertSiebert in 2014BornMarch 5, 1964\u00a0(1964-03-05) (age\u00a057)Berlin-WilmersdorfOccupationGerman mathematicianAwardsClay Research Award (2016)\nBernd Siebert (born 5 March 1964 in Berlin-Wilmersdorf) is a German mathematician who researches in algebraic geometry.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Papers\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nLife[edit]\nSiebert studied mathematics starting 1984 at the University of Erlangen.
