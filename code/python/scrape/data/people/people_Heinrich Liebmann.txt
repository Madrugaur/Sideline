{"name": "Heinrich Liebmann", "content": "Karl Otto Heinrich Liebmann  (* 22. October 1874 in Strasbourg; \u2020 12. June 1939 in Munich-Solln) was a German mathematician and geometer.[1]\n Liebmann was the son of Otto Liebmann (1840\u20131912), a Jewish neo-Kantian philosophy professor in Jena.[2] Heinrich studied from 1895 to 1897 at the universities Leipzig, Jena and G\u00f6ttingen. In 1895 he was awarded the doctorate under Carl Johannes Thomae with the subject Die einzweideutigen projektiven Punktverwandtschaften der Ebene  and passed the Lehramtspr\u00fcfung in 1896. In 1897 he was an assistant in G\u00f6ttingen and in 1898 in Leipzig, where he was habilitated on the subject \u00dcber die Verbiegung der geschlossenen Fl\u00e4chen positiver Kr\u00fcmmung. In this work, among other things, he stated Liebmann's theorem in differential geometry.\n In 1905, he became extraordinary professor in Leipzig, in 1910 extraordinary professor at the Technischen Hochschule M\u00fcnchen, where he became professor in 1915. In 1920 he followed Paul St\u00e4ckel as professor at the Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, where he became rector in 1926 and dean of the faculty of mathematics and natural science in 1923/1924 as well as in 1928/1929. In 1935 he asked for retirement due to political pressure of the national socialists because of Liebmann's Jewish ancestry.[3] He and his colleague Arthur Rosenthal were boycotted in his faculty. He spent his last years in Munich.\n In 1913 he married his first wife Natalie Liebmann, n\u00e9e Kraus (\u2020 1924), who was the daughter of Karl Kraus, professor of agricultural science in Munich. After the death of his first wife he married Helene Ehlers. He had four children.\n Liebmann was concerned, among other things, with differential geometry and non-Euclidean geometry. He discovered the construction of a triangle from its three angles by circle and ruler within hyperbolic geometry. In his habilitation, he showed that a convex closed surface cannot be bent (theorem of Minding and Liebmann's theorem). He translated the works of Nikolai Lobachevsky into German.\n Liebmann was a member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences, the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities.[4]\n ", "tags": ["1874 births", "1939 deaths", "19th-century German mathematicians", "20th-century German mathematicians", "University of Jena alumni", "Leipzig University faculty", "Technical University of Munich faculty", "Heidelberg University faculty", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from January 2020", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Karl Otto Heinrich LiebmannNationalityGermanKnown\u00a0forLiebmann's theoremScientific careerFieldsmathematicianDoctoral advisorCarl Johannes Thomae\n\nKarl Otto Heinrich Liebmann  (* 22.
