He served as  President of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, was President of the Association for Symbolic Logic from 1996 to 1998, and is currently the President of the \nDivision for Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science and Technology of the International Union for History and Philosophy of Science (DLMPST/IUHPS; 2016-2019). In 2016 he was elected an honorary foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2018 he received the Solomon Bublick Award.\n Menachem Magidor was born in Petah Tikva, Israel. He received his Ph.D. in 1973 from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His thesis, On Super Compact Cardinals, was written under the supervision of Azriel L\u00e9vy.[1] He served as  President of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1997 to 2009, following Hanoch Gutfreund and succeeded by Menachem Ben-Sasson.[2] The Oxford philosopher Ofra Magidor is his daughter.\n Magidor obtained several important consistency results on powers of singular cardinals substantially developing the method of forcing. He generalized the Prikry forcing in order to change the cofinality of a large cardinal to a predetermined regular cardinal. He proved that the least strongly compact cardinal can be equal to the least measurable cardinal or to the least supercompact cardinal (but not at the same time). Assuming consistency of huge cardinals he constructed models (1977) of set theory with first examples of nonregular ultrafilters over very small cardinals (related to the famous Guilmann Keisler problem concerning existence of nonregular ultrafilters), even with the example of jumping cardinality of ultrapowers. He proved consistent that \n\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph _{\\omega }}\n\n is strong limit, but \n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2135\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\u2135\n\n\u03c9\n+\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2^{\\aleph _{\\omega }}=\\aleph _{\\omega +2}}\n\n.

This constituted a negative solution to the singular cardinals hypothesis. Both proofs used the consistency of very large cardinals.
