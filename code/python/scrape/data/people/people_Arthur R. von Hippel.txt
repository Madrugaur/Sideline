{"name": "Arthur R. von Hippel", "content": "Arthur Robert von Hippel (November 19, 1898 \u2013 December 31, 2003)[1] was a German American materials scientist and physicist. Von Hippel was a pioneer in the study of dielectrics, ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials, and semiconductors and was a codeveloper of radar during World War II.[2]\n Von Hippel was born in Rostock, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, on November 19, 1898, and was the son of Robert von Hippel. He graduated in physics from the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where David Hilbert, Richard Courant, Robert Pohl, and the Nobel Prize winners Peter Debye, Max Born, and Gustav Hertz were among his teachers mathematics and physics. He received his Ph.D. in physics in 1924 under the Nobel Prize winner James Franck who in 1930 became his father-in-law by marriage with Franck's daughter Dagmar.\n In 1933, with the ascension of Nazis to power in Germany, von Hippel decided to move to another country, mainly because his wife was Jewish, but due also to his political stance against the new regime. In 1934 he was able to secure a position with the University at Istanbul, Turkey, then spent a year in Denmark, working at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. In 1936, accepting an invitation by Karl Compton, von Hippel moved again, this time to the U.S., and became an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During this time, he studied the properties and behavior of high voltage gas discharges, using positive and negative Lichtenberg figures recorded on photographic film. In 1940 he founded the Laboratory for Insulation Research, which soon became one of the most important research and education centers in this area in the world.\n Together with MIT's Radiation Lab, von Hippel and his collaborators helped to develop radar technology during the war. He was awarded the President's Certificate of Merit in 1948 by U.S. President Harry Truman. He became famous also for his discovery of ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of barium titanate (BaTiO3).\n During the war the results on dielectrics obtained by the Laboratory for Insulation Research were classified information. After the war these results were prepared for publication. In 1954 von Hippel published Dielectrics and Waves and assembled Dielectric Materials and Applications with 22 collaborators.[3] The Laboratory for Insulation Research also published several technical reports.[4]\n Arthur introduced his ideas of designing materials with properties prescribed for the purpose at hand, or molecular engineering, in 1956 in an article[5] that discussed impurities and dislocations in materials, and the use of imperfections. He edited the volume Molecular Science and Molecular Engineering (1959).[6][7]\n The premier award of the Materials Research Society is named in his honor.\n He died at 105 years of age, in 2003. His son, Frank N. von Hippel was a theoretical physicist and professor of Public Policy at Princeton University. Another son, Eric von Hippel, is a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management who has done pioneering research on user innovation. His uncle, Eugen von Hippel, described the ophthalmic hemangiomata that are part of von Hippel-Lindau disease, which bears his name.\n von Hippel is briefly mentioned in Ay\u015fe Kulin's historical novel Without a Country as one of the German scientists who took an academic position in Turkey while fleeing Nazi Germany.\n ", "tags": ["1898 births", "2003 deaths", "People from Rostock", "American physicists", "German physicists", "American materials scientists", "American centenarians", "German centenarians", "German emigrants to the United States", "People from the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Arthur R. von HippelBorn(1898-11-19)November 19, 1898Rostock, GermanyDiedDecember 31, 2003(2003-12-31) (aged\u00a0105)NationalityGermanCitizenshipAmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenKnown\u00a0forCodeveloping radar during World War  Discovering the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of barium titanateAwardsPresident's Certificate of MeritScientific careerFieldsPhysicistInstitutionsNiels Bohr Institute, MITDoctoral advisorJames FranckInfluencedDavid Hilbert, Richard Courant, Robert Pohl, Peter Debye, Max Born, Gustav Hertz, James Franck\nNotesHis uncle, Eugen von Hippel described the ophthalmic hemangiomata that are part of von Hippel\u2013Lindau disease, which bears his name.
