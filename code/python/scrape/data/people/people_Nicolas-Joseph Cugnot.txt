{"name": "Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot", "content": "\n Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot (26 February 1725 \u2013 2 October 1804) was a French inventor who built the world's first full-size and working self-propelled mechanical land-vehicle, the \"Fardier \u00e0 vapeur\" \u2014 effectively the world's first automobile.[a]\n He was born in Void-Vacon, Lorraine, (now departement of Meuse), France. He trained as a military engineer. In 1765, he began experimenting with working models of steam-engine-powered vehicles for the French Army, intended for transporting cannons.\n French Army Captain Cugnot was one of the first to successfully employ a device for converting the reciprocating motion of a steam piston into a rotary motion by means of a ratchet arrangement. A small version of his three-wheeled fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\") was made and used in 1769 (a fardier was a massively built two-wheeled horse-drawn cart for transporting very heavy equipment, such as cannon barrels).\n In 1770, a full-size version of the fardier \u00e0 vapeur was built, specified to be able to carry four tons and cover two lieues (7.8\u00a0km or 4.8 miles) in one hour, a performance it never achieved in practice. The vehicle weighed about 2.5 tonnes tare, and had two wheels at the rear and one in the front where the horses would normally have been. The front wheel supported a steam boiler and driving mechanism. The power unit was articulated to the \"trailer\", and was steered from there by means of a double handle arrangement. One source states that it seated four passengers and moved at a speed of 2.25 miles per hour (3.6\u00a0km/h).[2]\n The vehicle was reported to have been very unstable owing to poor weight distribution, a serious disadvantage for a vehicle intended to be able to traverse rough terrain and climb steep hills. In addition, boiler performance was also particularly poor, even by the standards of the day. The vehicle's fire needed to be relit, and its steam raised again, every quarter of an hour or so, which considerably reduced its overall speed and distance.\n After running a small number of trials, variously described as being between Paris and Vincennes and at Meudon, the project was abandoned. This ended the French Army's first experiment with mechanical vehicles. Even so, in 1772, King Louis XV granted Cugnot a pension of 600 livres a year for his innovative work, and the experiment was judged interesting enough for the fardier to be kept at the arsenal. In 1800 it was transferred to the Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers, where it can still be seen today.\n 241 years later, in 2010, a copy of the \"fardier de Cugnot\" was built by pupils at the Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech, a French Grande \u00e9cole, and the city of Void-Vacon. This replica worked perfectly, proving that the concept was viable and verifying the truth and results of the 1769 tests.[3]\n This replica was exhibited at the 2010 Paris Motor Show. It is now exhibited in Cugnot's native village of Void-Vacon, Meuse.[4]\n There are reports of a minor incident in 1771, when the second prototype vehicle is said to have accidentally knocked down a brick or stone wall, either that of a Paris garden or part of the Paris Arsenal walls, in perhaps the first known automobile accident.[5] The incident is unrecorded in contemporary accounts, first appearing in 1804, thirty-three years after the alleged accident. Nevertheless, the story persists that Cugnot was arrested and convicted of dangerous driving, another first for him if true.[6]\n Following the French Revolution, Cugnot's pension was withdrawn in 1789 and he went into exile in Brussels where he lived in poverty. Shortly before his death, Cugnot's pension was restored by Napoleon Bonaparte and he eventually returned to Paris where he died on 2 October 1804.\n Notes\n Citations\n Bibliography\n ", "tags": ["1725 births", "1804 deaths", "French automotive pioneers", "People from Meuse (department)", "French inventors", "People of the French Revolution", "French mechanical engineers", "Steam road vehicles", "Military vehicles of the late modern period", "18th-century French engineers", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from June 2013", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing French-language text", "CS1 maint: ref=harv", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with French-language sources (fr)", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French inventor (1725-1804)\n\n\nNicolas-Joseph CugnotNicolas-Joseph CugnotBorn(1725-02-26)26 February 1725Void-Vacon, Lorraine, FranceDied2 October 1804(1804-10-02) (aged\u00a079)Paris, FranceNationalityFrenchOccupationEngineerChildren2 childrenEngineering careerProjectsfardier \u00e0 vapeur\n\nNicolas-Joseph Cugnot (26 February 1725 \u2013 2 October 1804) was a French inventor who built the world's first full-size and working self-propelled mechanical land-vehicle, the \"Fardier \u00e0 vapeur\" \u2014 effectively the world's first automobile.[a]\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n2 First self-propelled vehicle\n3 First automobile accident\n4 Later life\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 Further reading\n8 External links\n\n\nBackground[edit]\nHe was born in Void-Vacon, Lorraine, (now departement of Meuse), France.
