{"name": "Enric Miralles", "content": "\n Enric Miralles Moya (12 February 1955 \u2013 3 July 2000) was a Spanish architect from Barcelona. He graduated from the Barcelona School of Architecture (ETSAB) at the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC) in 1978. After establishing his reputation with a number of collaborations with his first wife Carme Pin\u00f3s, the couple separated in 1991. Miralles later married fellow architect Benedetta Tagliabue, and the two practiced together as EMBT Architects. Miralles' magnum opus and his largest project, the new Scottish Parliament Building, was unfinished at the time of his death.\n In 1978, Miralles completed his examinations at the Escola T\u00e8cnica Superior d'Arquitectura (ETSAB) in Barcelona. From 1973 to 1978, he worked in the architect's office of Albert Viaplana and Helio Pi\u00f1\u00f3n.[1] Whilst there\u2014among other things\u2014he was involved in the construction of the Pla\u00e7a dels Pa\u00efsos Catalans, the forecourt for the Estaci\u00f3 de Sants. In 1984, after several architectural competition awards, Miralles formed his own office in Barcelona with his first wife Carme Pin\u00f3s, which they led together until 1991. Within the rising Spanish architecture scene of the late 1980s following the death of Francisco Franco, their unusual buildings attracted international attention. As a result, they received numerous commissions from Spain and overseas. After their separation, Miralles and Pin\u00f3s continued to work in separate offices.\n In 1993, Enric Miralles formed a new practice with his second wife, the Italian architect Benedetta Tagliabue, under the name \"EMBT Architects\". She resumed the practice under his name after his death. The most important projects; the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh and the multistoried building for the Spanish gas company Gas Natural in Barcelona, were only finished after his death. Enric Miralles died at the age of 45 as the result of a brain tumor.[2]\n The independent architectural language of Enric Miralles can be difficult to classify in terms of contemporary architecture. It is influenced by Spanish architects, such as Alejandro de la Sota, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Coderch and Josep Maria Jujol, and also from international greats such as Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn and Alvar Aalto and the Russian Constructivist movement of the early 20th century. The freely formed buildings utilising massive building materials and steel, develop from their relationship with the environment and connect themselves to it. The form is constructed using often unusual materials which are generally left with natural surfaces. Form and material interpret the place, traditions and history in a personal and poetic art, as his critics attest. From the starting point of the townscape or landscape he would design a building in its totality, down to the details of the furnishing and the exterior installations. Therefore, the execution of the details was just as important to the communication of meaning as the main form. Both were developed over a large number of designs and with numerous models as the main tool of the design process.\n Charles Jencks, writing on the problems surrounding the construction of the Scottish Parliament Building and the controversial reception of its design for Architecture Today, summed up Miralles' architectural style:\n Miralles, like many other postmodern architects, has a preference for piling on the motifs and ideas: upturned boats, keel shapes, deep window reveals like a castle, crow-steps, prow shapes, diagonal gutters, 'bamboo bundles' and above all the dark granite gun-shape that repeats as an ornamental motif at a huge scale. Everywhere broken silhouettes compete for attention, just like the alleyways next door. That's fine, and contextual, but it's quite a meal. As a result of the complexity, the parliament is really a kind of small city, with much too much to digest in one short three-hour sitting. The Scottish parliament will take time to judge: maybe not 50 years but three or four visits, long enough to absorb all the richness and get used to those jumpy black granite guns, the most arbitrary of several questionable ornaments.[3] Enric Miralles was an active teacher at numerous universities. In 1985, he became a professor at the ETSAB in Barcelona. During 1990, he took over the conceptional design chair at the St\u00e4delschule in Frankfurt am Main. In 1993, Miralles received an invitation from Harvard University to occupy the Kenzo Tange chair. He taught as a guest lecturer at Columbia University in New York, Princeton University in New Jersey, the Architectural Association in London, the Berlage Instituut in Rotterdam, the Mackintosh School of Architecture in Glasgow and the Universities of Buenos Aires and Mexico City.\n In Partnership with Carme Pin\u00f3s\n In Partnership with Benedetta Tagliabue\n ", "tags": ["Enric Miralles buildings", "Catalan architects", "Modernist architects", "Harvard University faculty", "Stirling Prize laureates", "Deaths from brain tumor", "Deaths from cancer in Spain", "1955 births", "2000 deaths", "Polytechnic University of Catalonia alumni", "CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)", "Use dmy dates from March 2016", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 Catalan-language sources (ca)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with suppressed authority control identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nEnric MirallesThe Scottish Parliament Building committee room ceiling.Born(1955-02-12)12 February 1955Barcelona, SpainDied3 July 2000(2000-07-03) (aged\u00a045)Sant Feliu de Codines, Province of Barcelona, SpainNationalitySpainOccupationArchitectAwards\nMadrid City Prize (1993)\nSpanish Architecture Award (1995)\nGolden Lion (1996)\nStirling Prize (2005)\nPracticePi\u00f1on-ViaplanaMiralles + Pin\u00f3sEMBTBuildingsScottish Parliament BuildingIgualada Cemetery\n\n Igualada Cemetery\n Santa Caterina Market (Video on YouTube)\n Exterior view of the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh\n Debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament\n Igualada Cemetery (Cementiri Nou), 1993 - View towards entrance\n Igualada Cemetery (Cementiri Nou), Fall 1993 - View of precast concrete screens\n Archery Pavilion, 1992 - View of precast roof elements at change rooms\n Archery Pavilion, 1992\nEnric Miralles Moya (12 February 1955 \u2013 3 July 2000) was a Spanish architect from Barcelona.
