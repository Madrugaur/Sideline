{"name": "Humberto Fern\u00e1ndez-Mor\u00e1n", "content": "Humberto Fern\u00e1ndez-Mor\u00e1n Villalobos (February 18, 1924\u00a0\u2013  March 17, 1999) was a Venezuelan research scientist born in Maracaibo, Venezuela, renowned for inventing the diamond knife or scalpel, significantly advancing the development of electromagnetic lenses for electron microscopy based on superconducting technology, and many other scientific contributions.\n Fern\u00e1ndez-Mor\u00e1n founded the Venezuelan Institute for Neurological and Brain Studies, the predecessor of the current Venezuelan Institute of Scientific Research (IVIC). He studied medicine at the University of Munich, where he graduated summa cum laude in 1944. He contributed to the development of the electron microscope and was the first person to use the concept of cryo-ultramicrotomy. After flying over Angel Falls in his home country of Venezuela he was inspired by the concept of the smoothly reoccurring flow system inherent in a waterfall to take his diamond knife invention and combine it with an ultramicrotome to dramatically improve the ultra-thin sectioning of electron microscopy samples. The ultramictrotome advances the rotating, drum-mounted specimen sample in such small increments (utilizing the very low thermal expansion coefficient of Invar) past the stationary diamond knife that sectioning thicknesses of several Angstrom units are possible.  He also helped to advance the field of electron cryomicroscopy - the use of superconductive electromagnetic lenses cooled with liquid helium in electron microscopes to achieve the highest resolution possible - among many other research topics.\n Fern\u00e1ndez-Mor\u00e1n was commissioned in 1957 with the supervision of the first Venezuelan research nuclear reactor, the RV-1 nuclear reactor, one of the first in Latin America.[1]\n He was appointed Minister of Science during the last year of the regime of Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez and was forced to leave Venezuela when the dictatorship was overthrown in 1958. He worked with NASA for the Apollo Project and taught in many universities, such as MIT, University of Chicago and the University of Stockholm.\n He donated a collection of his papers to the National Library of Medicine in 1986.[2]\n His wife Anna was Swedish and together they had two daughters, Brigida Elena and Ver\u00f3nica.\n The body of Dr. Humberto Fern\u00e1ndez-Mor\u00e1n Villalobos was cremated and his ashes rest today in Cemetery The Square Luxburg-Carolath in his hometown, Maracaibo.\n ", "tags": ["1924 births", "1999 deaths", "People from Maracaibo", "Venezuelan inventors", "Venezuelan scientists", "Microscopists", "Central University of Venezuela faculty", "Knights of the Order of the Polar Star", "20th-century inventors", "Venezuelan emigrants to Sweden", "All articles with incomplete citations", "Articles with incomplete citations from November 2012", "All pages needing factual verification", "Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from June 2012", "Articles needing additional references from March 2011", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "In this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Fern\u00e1ndez-Mor\u00e1n and the second or maternal family name is  Villalobos.\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
