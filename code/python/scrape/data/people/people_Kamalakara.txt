{"name": "Kamalakara", "content": "\nKamalakara (1616\u20131700), an Indian astronomer and mathematician, came from a learned family of scholars from Golagr\u0101ma, a village on the northern bank of the river God\u0101var\u012b. His father was Nrsimha who was born in 1586.[1] Two of Kamalakara's three brothers were also astronomer and mathematicians: Divakara, who was the eldest of the brothers born in 1606, and Ranganatha who was youngest. Kamal\u0101kara learnt astronomy from his elder brother Div\u0101kara, who compiled five works on astronomy. His family later moved to V\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012b.[2]\n Kamal\u0101kara's major work, \"Siddh\u0101ntatattvaviveka\", was compiled in Varanasi at about 1658 and has been published by Sudhakar Dwivedi in the V\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012b series. This work consists of 13 chapters in 3,024 verses. It deals with the topics of: units of time measurement; mean motions of the planets; true longitudes of the planets; the three problems of diurnal rotation; diameters and distances of the planets; the earth's shadow; the moon's crescent; risings and settings; syzygies; lunar eclipses, solar eclipses; planetary transits across the sun's disk; the patas of the moon and sun; the \"great problems\"; along a conclusion. His other works include \u015ae\u1e63av\u0101san\u0101 and Saurav\u0101san\u0101. Kamal\u0101kara was bitterly opposed to Munishvara, the author of Siddh\u0101ntas\u0101rvabhauma.\n It is wrongly believed by some moderners that Kamal\u0101kara discovered the idea that the pole star we see at present is not exactly at the pole. But this ideas was first expressed in Brahmananda Purana and Matsya Purana by sage Veda Vyaasa: \"uttAnapAda-putro-asau meDhibhooto dhruvo divi | sa hi bhraman bhtaamayate nityam chandraadityau grahaiH saha ||\".

In particular he gives formulae for sin(A/2) and sin(A/4) in terms of sin(A) and iterative formulae for sin(A/3) and sin(A/5).\nAccording to David Pingree, he presents the only Sanskrit treatise on geometrical optics.[3]\nHe has assumed a value of 60 units for the radius of the Earth and gives values for sines at 1\u00b0 intervals.\nKamal\u0101kara also gives a table for finding the right ascension of a planet from its longitude\nArticles[edit]\nA K Bag, \"Indian literature on mathematics during 1400\u20131800 A.D.\", Indian J.
