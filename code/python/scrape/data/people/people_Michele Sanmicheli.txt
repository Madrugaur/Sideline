{"name": "Michele Sanmicheli", "content": "Michele Sanmicheli (also spelled Sanmmicheli, Sanmichele or Sammichele) (1484\u20131559), was a Venetian architect and urban planner of Mannerist-style, among the greatest of his era.

He also regularised the Piazza Br\u00e0, opening up a vista to the Arena.\n\nWorks[edit]\n Palazzo Roncale at Rovigo\n Palazzo Bevilacqua, in Verona: a richly-detailed bay of the piano nobile\nHe found time to spare from his official commissions to build three palazzi in Verona that have been central to his reputation, though documentation has proved elusive. These are:\n\nPalazzo Pompei (probably begun around 1530) is an enriched version of Bramante's House of Raphael. The entrance has been moved to the center of a seven-bay fa\u00e7ade[3] and given a slightly wider central bay; in order to prevent the composition from rifting apart, the corner columns of the outermost bays are stressed by being doubled with  square pilasters.\nPalazzo Canossa (under construction in 1537), with another seven-bay front, has a triple-arched central entrance in a high rusticated basement that is pierced by low mezzanine windows. In the piano nobile arch-headed windows are framed by doubled pilasters, so that each bay reads as a unit complete in itself, while the arch imposts are emphasized by a moulding that appears to run continuously behind the pilasters, to tie together the sequence of bays. There is a second mezzanine above the piano nobile, under a powerfully projecting cornice capped with a balustrade, with a skyline of figural sculptures. Strong mouldings continue the imposts of the arched openings and windows. The palazzo wraps round a three-sided court open to the Adige on the fourth side.\nPalazzo Bevilacqua (under construction in 1529), the most famous of the three and often cited as an exemplar of Mannerism in architecture, is the richest fa\u00e7ade of its generation, rivalling Giulio Romano's Palazzo Te. Its complex superimposed layers, its alternating superimposed rhythms of large and small bays and straight and spiralling fluting, the rich carved decor in its keystones and in the spandrels of the piano nobile arches, climax in the rich sculpture of its corbelled cornice.\n The lion of St. Mark on the Porta Terraferma, Zadar, Croatia\nOne of Sanmicheli's most graceful designs is the Cappella  Pellegrini in the church of San Bernardino at Verona, where the cylindrical exterior masks a domed interior that rearranges elements of the Pantheon. His other works include Palazzo Corner a San Polo and Palazzo Grimani di San Luca in Venice, the Porta Terraferma in Zadar and the funerary Petrucci Chapel in the church of San Domenico in Orvieto.\nBeside the Ponte Nuovo in Verona (demolished in the late 19th century), his last work, begun in 1559, was the Santuario di Madonna di Campagna (or Santa Maria della Pace), formerly outside Verona on the road to Venice. The cylindrical church, with a band of blind and windowed arcading under a wide plain frieze, crowned with a dome, was probably modified during its construction by Bernardino Brugnoli.[4][5][6]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ The Montefiascone duomo was not completed until 1843. The great dome is not Sanmicheli's; it was designed by Carlo Fontana towards the end of the 17th century but left unfinished for more than a century; the Neoclassical fa\u00e7ade and the campanili are 19th-century.\n\n^ Quoted in Murray, p. 180.\n\n^ In Bramante's House of Raphael, the ground floor was given over to premises for shops.\n\n^ The book that was mistaken for Sanmicheli's own in the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica was Li cinque ordini dell' architettura civile di Michel Sanmicheli, printed at Verona in 1735 by conte Alessandro Pompei, the heir of Sanmicheli's patron who lived in Palazzo Pompei, Verona. Pompei was a noble amateur architect with links to the circle of Scipione Maffei. Noting the lack of existing drawings by Sanmicheli, and the absence of theoretical contributions on his part, Pompei analyzed Sanmicheli\u2019s use of the orders of architecture, comparing them with those of the outstanding published masters, Vignola, Serlio and Palladio. His publication attracted the attention of a young generation of neoclassical architects to the forgotten Michele Sanmichele. In 1862 measured drawings published by Francesco Ronzani and Girolamo Luciolli inaugurated the modern reappraisal of his work. The work was published as three folio volumes, with a portrait frontispiece and 150 engraved plates.\n\n^ Alessandro Pompei, Li cinque ordini d'architettura civile di Michele Sanmicheli non pi\u00f9 veduti in luce, ora publicati, ed esposti con quelli di Vitruvio e d'altri cinque, Verona, 1735\n\n^ Michele Sanmicheli; Francesco Zanotto; Francesco Ronzani; Girolamo Luciolli.
