{"name": "Josep Llu\u00eds Sert", "content": "\n Josep Llu\u00eds Sert i L\u00f3pez (Catalan pronunciation:\u00a0[\u0292u\u02c8z\u025bb \u028eu\u02c8is \u02c8s\u025b\u027et]; 1 July 1902\u00a0\u2013 15 March 1983) was a Spanish architect and city planner.\n Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Sert showed keen interest in the works of his uncle, the painter Josep Maria Sert, and of Gaud\u00ed. He studied architecture at the Escola Superior d'Arquitectura in Barcelona and set up his own studio in 1929. That same year Sert moved to Paris, in response to an invitation from Le Corbusier to work for him (without payment). Returning to Barcelona in 1930, he continued his practice there until 1937. During the 1930s, Sert co-founded the group GATCPAC (Grup d'Artistes i T\u00e8cnics Catalans per al Progr\u00e9s de l'Arquitectura Contempor\u00e0nia, i.e. Group of Catalan Artists and Technicians for the Progress of Contemporary Architecture), which later became, with the addition of the western and north groups, the GATEPAC (Grupo de Artistas y T\u00e9cnicos Espa\u00f1oles para el Progreso de l'Arquitectura Contempor\u00e1nea), which was in turn the Spanish branch of the Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM). Sometime later, Sert became President of CIAM (1947\u201356). He created several outstanding pieces of modern architecture during this period, such as the week-end house in El Garraf, Catalonia, Spain (1935), the Central Dispensary of Barcelona (1935) and the Master Plan for the City of Barcelona (1933\u201335). From 1937 through 1939, Sert lived in Paris, where he designed the Spanish Republic's pavilion at the World's Fair, the Paris Exposition of 1937. For the artistic content of the building, Sert called on his Spanish artist friends Picasso, Mir\u00f3, and Calder; Picasso's contribution was Guernica and became the focal attraction of Sert's design.[1]\n In 1939, Sert went into exile in New York City where he worked with the Town Planning Associates, carrying out numerous urban plans for cities in South America.\n In 1952, Sert held a one-year Visiting Professorship at Yale University. The following year he became Dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design (1953\u20131969). There, Sert initiated the world's first degree program in urban design;[3] integrated the programs of architecture, planning, landscape and urban design, and taught many of today's leading architects. During this period, he served on the Advisory Board of the newly created Graham Foundation in Chicago, Illinois.\n In 1955, Sert founded a studio in Cambridge, Massachusetts which in 1958 became a partnership with Huson Jackson and Ronald Gourley. Joseph Zalewski was the Associate and continued to be in the firm Sert, Jackson and Associate founded in 1963. The studio designed many well-known projects including the Maeght Foundation (1959\u201364) in southern France, the Fundaci\u00f3 Mir\u00f3 (museum) in Barcelona (1975) and quite a few buildings for Harvard University, including Holyoke Center (1958\u201365), the Harvard Science Center (1969\u201372), Peabody Terrace (apartments, 1962\u201364), and the Center for the Study of World Religions at the Harvard Divinity School. Among other notable buildings in the vicinity are a complex at Boston University including its law school, student union, and main library (1960\u201365), Sert's home in Cambridge, as well as the Martin Luther King elementary school (1968\u201371), located across from Peabody Terrace. In New York, he completed the Eastwood and Westview apartments on Roosevelt Island, NYC (1976).\n In 1961, Sert brought Le Corbusier to the United States to design the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard, and a gallery in the Carpenter Center is now named in Sert's honor. In 1981, he received the AIA Gold Medal.\n Josep Lluis Sert counted amongst his close friends the likes of Alexander Calder, Joan Mir\u00f3, Georges Braque, and Marc Chagall, for whom he designed studios and homes.[4] He brought art into the Harvard curriculum through his commissioning of the Carpenter Center and his subsequent avid support for it. His design for the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, the Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3 in Barcelona and the Museum School were more than an architect-client relationship, they were partnerships in the discovery of modern art.\n Among Sert's students and colleagues in his studio were leading and past master architects from the United States, Spain, France, Bolivia and Brazil, Venezuela, as well as Dolf Schnebli of Switzerland, Fumihiko Maki of Japan, Christopher Charles Benninger of India; and many more.\n ", "tags": ["Catalan architects", "Catalan urban planners", "Modernist architects", "1902 births", "1983 deaths", "Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne members", "Exiles of the Spanish Civil War in the United States", "Harvard Graduate School of Design faculty", "People from Ibiza", "20th-century Spanish architects", "Honorary Members of the Royal Academy", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Use dmy dates from November 2020", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with suppressed authority control identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nSpanish architect and city planner\nIn this Catalan name, the first or paternal surname is  Sert and the second or maternal family name is  L\u00f3pez; both are generally joined by the conjunction \"i\".\n Josep Llu\u00eds Sert (1981)\n Boston University Library and Law Tower, Boston, Massachusetts\nJosep Llu\u00eds Sert i L\u00f3pez (Catalan pronunciation:\u00a0[\u0292u\u02c8z\u025bb \u028eu\u02c8is \u02c8s\u025b\u027et]; 1 July 1902\u00a0\u2013 15 March 1983) was a Spanish architect and city planner.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Career in the United States\n1.2 The art world\n\n\n2 Major buildings and projects\n3 Bibliography\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nBorn in Barcelona, Catalonia, Sert showed keen interest in the works of his uncle, the painter Josep Maria Sert, and of Gaud\u00ed.
