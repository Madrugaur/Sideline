Perles used this configuration to prove the existence of irrational polytopes in higher dimensions.[3]\nThe Perles\u2013Sauer\u2013Shelah lemma, a result in extremal set theory whose proof was credited to Perles by Saharon Shelah.[4][5]\nThe pumping lemma for context-free languages, a widely used method for proving that a language is not context-free that Perles discovered with Yehoshua Bar-Hillel and Eli Shamir.[6]\nNotable students of Perles include Noga Alon, Gil Kalai, and Nati Linial.[2]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Faculty profile, Hebrew University, retrieved 2013-12-12.\n\n^ a b Micha Perles at the Mathematics Genealogy Project\n\n^ Gr\u00fcnbaum, Branko (2003), Convex polytopes, Graduate Texts in Mathematics, 221 (Second\u00a0ed.), New York: Springer-Verlag, pp.\u00a093\u201395, ISBN\u00a00-387-00424-6, MR\u00a01976856.\n\n^ Shelah, Saharon (1972), \"A combinatorial problem; stability and order for models and theories in infinitary languages\", Pacific Journal of Mathematics, 41: 247\u2013261, doi:10.2140/pjm.1972.41.247, MR\u00a00307903.\n\n^ Kalai, Gil (September 28, 2008), \"Extremal Combinatorics III: Some Basic Theorems\", Combinatorics and More.\n\n^ Dewdney, A.
