{"name": "Beryl May Dent", "content": "\n \n Beryl May Dent MIEE (10 May 1900\u00a0\u2013 9 August 1977) was an English mathematical physicist, technical librarian, and a programmer of early analogue and digital computers to solve electrical engineering problems. She was born in Chippenham, Wiltshire, the eldest daughter of schoolteachers. The family left Chippenham in 1901, after her father became head teacher of the then recently established Warminster County School. She graduated from the University of Bristol in 1923 with First Class Honours in applied mathematics. She was awarded the Ashworth Hallett scholarship by the university and was accepted as a postgraduate student at Newnham College, Cambridge.\n She returned to Bristol in 1925, after being appointed a researcher in the Physics Department at the University of Bristol, with her salary being paid by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1927, John Lennard\u2011Jones was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics. Lennard\u2011Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and she became one of his first collaborators. They published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, that were to become the foundation of her master's thesis. Later work has shown that the results they obtained had direct application to atomic force microscopy by predicting that non-contact imaging is possible only at small tip-sample separations.\n In 1930, she joined Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company Ltd, Manchester, as a technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff of the research department. She became active in the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB) and was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the Lancashire and Cheshire branch of the association. She served on various ASLIB committees and made conference presentations detailing different aspects of the company's library and information service. She continued to publish scientific papers, contributing numerical methods for solving differential equations by the use of the differential analyser that was built for the University of Manchester and Douglas Hartree. She was the first to develop a detailed reduced major axis method for the best fit of a series of data points.\n Later in her career she became leader of the computation section at Metropolitan-Vickers, and then a supervisor in the research department for the section that was investigating semiconducting materials. She joined the Women's Engineering Society and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design. She retired in 1960, with Isabel Hardwich, later a fellow and president of the Women's Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department. In 1962, she moved with her mother and sister to Sompting, West Sussex, and died there in 1977.\n Beryl May was born on (1900-05-10)10 May 1900, at Penley Villa, Park Lane, Chippenham, Wiltshire, the eldest daughter of Agnes Dent (1869\u20131967), n\u00e9e\u00a0Thornley, and Eustace Edward (1868\u20131954).[1] She was baptised at St\u00a0Paul's, Chippenham, on 8 June 1900.[2]:1 They had married at St Mary's Church, Goosnargh, near Preston, Lancashire, on 27\u00a0July 1898.[3] Thornley was educated at the Harris Institute, Preston, passing examinations in science and art.[4] She was a teacher at Attercliffe School, in northeast Sheffield, before moving to Goosnargh School, near her hometown of Preston, where her elder brother and sister, John William and Mary Ann Thornley, were the head teachers.[5][6] In March 1894, she had applied for the headship at Fairfield School, Cockermouth, making the shortlist, but the board decided to appoint a local candidate.[7]\n On 18\u00a0March 1889, Dent's father was appointed to a teaching assistant position at Portland Road School, in Calderdale, Halifax, after completing a teaching apprenticeship with the school board.[8][9] In the same year, Florence Emily Dent, her father's elder sister, was appointed head teacher at West Vale girls' school, Stainland Road, Greetland, moving from the Higher Board School at Halifax.[10] In August 1889, he obtained a first class pass in mathematics from the Halifax Mechanics' Institute.[11][a] He then enrolled on a degree course at University College, Aberystwyth, in the Education Day Training College.[b] In January 1894, he was awarded a first by Aberystwyth, and a first in the external University of London examinations.[13][14][c] His first teaching post was at Coopers' Company Grammar School, Bow, London,[15] before moving to Chippenham, where he was a senior assistant teacher at the Chippenham County School. After five years at Chippenham, he left in October 1901 to become head teacher of the then recently established Warminster County School, that adjoined the Athenaeum Theatre in Warminster.[16][17][18][d] He was chair of the Warminster Urban District Council from 1920 to 1922,[e] and remained as head teacher of the County School until his retirement in August 1929.[22][21][f]\n After moving from Chippenham, the family lived at Boreham Road, Warminster, where houses were built in the early 19th century.[25][26][g] In April 1907, the family moved to 22 Portway, Warminster, situated a short distance from the County School and the Athenaeum.[20]:264[27] Her father was a regular cast member of the Warminster Operatic Society at the Athenaeum and other venues. Dent and her younger sister, Florence Mary, would often appear with him on stage in such operettas as Snow White and the seven dwarfs  and the Princess Ju\u2011Ju (The Golden Amulet), a Japanese operetta in three acts by Clementine Ward.[28][29][30] In Princess Ju\u2011Ju, she played La La, one of the three maidens attendant on the Princess Ju\u2011Ju, and sang the first act solo, She must be demure.[31][32] In act two of the same musical, she performed in the fan dance, Spirits of the Night.[29][32][h] She also acted in a scene from Tennyson's Princess at the County School's prize giving day on 16\u00a0December 1913.[35][i]\n Dent was educated at Warminster County School, where her father was head teacher. At school, she was close friends with her neighbour at Portway, Evelyn Mary Day, the eldest daughter of Henry George Day, a former butler to Colonel Charles Gathorne Gathorne\u2011Hardy, son of Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook.[37][38][j] In August 1914, she passed the University of Oxford Junior Local Examination with First Class Honours, and on the strength of her examination result, she was awarded a scholarship by the County School. In 1915, she passed the senior examination with second class honours and a distinction in French, and subsequently, her scholarship was renewed.[39][40][41] She then joined the sixth form and won the school prize for French in December 1916.[42][k] In March 1918, she applied for a scholarship in mathematics from Somerville College, Oxford, one of the first two women's colleges in Oxford. She was highly commended but was not awarded a scholarship nor an exhibition.[43]\n Dent was accepted on to the general Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree course at the University of Bristol and passed her intermediate degree examinations in June 1920.[l] For the following academic year, she took the honours course in mathematics at Bristol.[45] After spending the summer of 1921 at her parent's home in Warminster,[46] she returned for the start of the 1921 to 1922 academic year to find that Paul Dirac had joined the mathematics course.[47][m] Dent and Dirac were taught applied mathematics by Henry Ronald Hass\u00e9, the then head of the Mathematics Department, and pure mathematics by Peter Fraser. Both of them had come from Cambridge.[47] Fraser introduced them to mathematical rigour, projective geometry, and rigorous proofs in differential and integral calculus.[48][n] Dent studied four courses in pure mathematics:\n There was a choice of specialisation in the final year; applied or pure mathematics. As the only official, registered fee-paying student, Dent had the right to choose, and she settled on applied mathematics for the final year. The department could offer only one set of lectures so Dirac also had to follow the same course.[50][o] Dent studied four courses in applied mathematics:\n In June 1923, she graduated with Dirac, gaining a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in applied mathematics with First Class Honours.[51][47][p] On 7\u00a0July 1923, she was awarded the Ashworth Hallett scholarship by the University of Bristol and was accepted as a postgraduate student at Newnham College, Cambridge.[50][52][53][q] Dent spent a year at Cambridge, leaving in 1924 without further academic qualification, prior to being appointed to a temporary position teaching science at Barnsley Girls' High School, Huddersfield Road, Barnsley.[53] Before 1948, Cambridge University denied women graduates a degree, although in the same year as Dent left Cambridge, Katharine Margaret Wilson was the first woman to be awarded a PhD by the university.[55][r]\n In 1925, Dent was appointed a researcher in the Physics Department at the University of Bristol, with her salary being paid by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the forerunner of the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC).[57]:107[53][s] In 1924, the University of Bristol Council had set aside a portion of a bequest from Henry Herbert Wills for the Department of Physics where Arthur Mannering Tyndall was building up a staff for teaching and research in the H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory, Royal Fort House Gardens.[59][t] From August 1925, John Lennard\u2011Jones, Trinity College, Cambridge, was elected Reader in Mathematical Physics.[61][59] In March 1927, Lennard\u2011Jones was appointed Professor of Theoretical physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics.[62][63]:24[64][u] Lennard\u2011Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and Dent became one of his first collaborators.[59][47]\n Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, with the objective of calculating theoretically the properties of carbonate and nitrate crystals.[47][65] Dent's thesis for her master's degree, Some theoretical determinations of crystal structure (1927), was the basis of the three papers that followed in 1927; with Lennard\u2011Jones, Crystal parameters, and with Lennard\u2011Jones and Sydney Chapman, Structure of carbonate crystals (1927) and Part II. Structure of carbonate crystals (1927).[v] On 28\u00a0June 1927, she was awarded a MSc degree for her thesis and research work.[66] In 1927, the physics laboratory at Bristol had a surplus of funds, and so it was decided that the funds would be used to provide more technical help.[w] Consequently, Dent was asked to combine her research duties with the post of part-time departmental librarian, the first appointment of librarian in the Department of Physics.[63]:26[1][x]\n Dent was now living at Clifton Hill House, the university hall of residence for women in Clifton.[67][y] She had been appointed honorary secretary of the Bristol Cheeloo Association by March 1926.[70] The association's aim was to raise sufficient funds to support a chair of chemistry at Cheeloo University.[67] In an effort to publicise the cause and raise money, she presented to the local branch of the Women's International League in October 1928.[71] In 1927, she was one of eleven people elected to the standing committee of the University of Bristol's Convocation, the university's alumni association, and later, represented the Manchester branch of the association.[72][73][68] In 1928, Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent published two papers, Cohesion at a crystal surface (1928), and with Sydney Chapman, The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary (1928), that studied the force fields on a thin crystal cleavage.[74][75] Around this time, quantum mechanics was developed to become the standard formulation for atomic physics.[z] Lennard\u2011Jones left Bristol in 1929 to study the subject for a year as a Rockefeller Fellow at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.[77]\n With her collaborator and advisor in Germany, Dent wrote one last paper before leaving the physics department at Bristol: The effect of boundary distortion on the surface energy of a crystal (1929) examined the effect of the polarisation of surface ions in decreasing the surface energy of alkali halides.[78] In December 1929, she resigned her position and it was accepted with regret by the Council of the University of Bristol.[79] She left Bristol for Stretford, Manchester, to become the technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff in the research department at Metropolitan-Vickers.[80]:232 In 1930, Lennard\u2011Jones returned to Bristol, as Dean of the Faculty of Science, and introduced the new quantum theories to the Bristol group.[77][59][aa] Marjorie Josephine Littleton was appointed as Dent's replacement on the 1\u00a0February 1930. She was the daughter of a local Bristol councillor and a graduate of Girton College, Cambridge. She was later Sir Neville Mott's co-author and research assistant in the physics department.[82][83]:517\n Metropolitan-Vickers was a British heavy industrial firm, based at Trafford Park, Manchester. They were well known for industrial electrical equipment and generators, street lighting, electronics, steam turbines and diesel locomotives. They built the Metrovick 950, the first commercial transistorised computer.[84] In 1917, a Research and Education Department was established at the Trafford Park site, when the care of the library came within the remit of James George Pearce, a former engineer in the Transformer Department.[ab] He made the library the centre of a new technical intelligence section. In 1929, the technical intelligence section was substantially reorganised and expanded, and placed under the directorship of James Steele Park Paton.[80]:193[85] In January 1930, Dent joined the senior scientific and technical staff in the research at department Metropolitan-Vickers.[63]:49[80]:193 Technical librarianship emerged as a new scientific career in interwar Britain and rapidly became one of the few types of professional industrial employment that was routinely open to both women and men.[86]:301\n By 1933, the Metropolitan-Vickers library had 3,000 engineering volumes and around the same number in pamphlets and patent specifications.[87] Besides covering electrical subjects, the library covered accountancy, employment questions, and subjects of interest to the sales department. It also issued a weekly bulletin, scrutinised patents, handled patents taken out by research staff, and exchanged information with associated companies.[88] From 1931 to 1936, Dent was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the Lancashire and Cheshire branch of the ASLIB.[89]:204\u2013205 In 1932, the branch had twenty six members and had organised four meetings, including one addressed by Sir Henry Tizard, the then President of ASLIB. After the war, it formed the basis for the Northern Branch of the association.[90]:412 She was also a delegate at the fourteenth International Conference on Documentation and was invited to the Government's conference dinner on 22\u00a0September 1938 at the Great Dining Hall of Christ Church, Oxford.[91][ac] She served on various ASLIB committees and made conference presentations detailing different aspects of the company's library and information service.[80]:228[92]\n Dent continued to publish papers in applied mathematics and contribute to papers on emerging computational technologies. In On observations of points connected by a linear relation (1935), she developed a detailed reduced major axis method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock and Charles Kummell.[93][94] For Myers, Hartree, and Porter, in The Effect of Space-Charge on the Secondary Current in a Triode (1937), she provided the key numerical integrations for differential equations to aid in the calculation of the space charge limitation of secondary current using a differential analyser.[95] In 1946, she was promoted to section leader of the company's new computation section. Her knowledge of higher mathematics meant that she was often asked to check the mathematics in papers for publication by engineers at Metropolitan-Vickers. For example, Cyril Frederick Gradwell, a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, asked her to scrutinise the algebraic part of his work in The Solution of a problem in disk bending occurring in connexion with gas turbines (1950).[96][ad]\n In the latter half of her career, Dent became the section leader for the women in the research department that were working on semiconducting materials.[80]:233 She performed the Fourier analysis in Shorting and Field Corrections in Hall Measurements (1954), that developed a method for correcting the measured Hall effect in semiconductors for inhomogeneities in the applied magnetic field.[98] In 1958, she carried out computer calculations for the mechanical engineering team at the Nuclear Power Group, Radbroke Hall. Their paper outlined a procedure for calculating the theoretical deflection (bending) of a circular grid of support girders for a graphite neutron moderator in a gas-cooled reactor.[99] A general expression was derived from the central deflection of the grid and the maximum bending moment on the central cross-beam for a range of grid diameters.[100]\n Dent joined the Women's Engineering Society and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design.[101][102] With Brian Birtwistle, she wrote programs for the Manchester University Ferranti Mark 1, that demonstrated that high speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer.[103] Birtwistle would later have an extensive career in the computer industry, working at, amongst others, Honeywell Information Systems and ADP Network Services.[104] She retired from Metropolitan-Vickers in May 1960, with Isabel Hardwich, later a fellow and president of the Women's Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department.[105][106]:243\n Dent's father died on (1954-06-24)24 June 1954, at their shared home, 529 King's Road, Stretford, with the funeral service taking place at St\u00a0Matthew's Church, Stretford.[107] Dent had close links to St\u00a0Matthew's; from 1956 to 1962, she served as a school manager for St\u00a0Matthew's Church of England Primary School at Poplar Road, Stretford.[53] In 1962, she and her elderly mother, Agnes, moved from Stretford to 1 Cokeham Road, Sompting, a village in the coastal Adur District of West Sussex, between Lancing and Worthing.[108][109] Agnes died on (1967-04-05)5 April 1967 and was cremated at the Downs Crematorium on 10 April 1967.[110][ae]\n Dent died at her home in Sompting on 9 August 1977(1977-08-09) (aged\u00a077).[113][114] She donated her body for medical examination, on the understanding that her remains would be returned for a funeral service at St\u00a0Mary's Church, Sompting, followed by cremation.[115] Her ashes were interred at Worthing Crematorium, in the Gardens of Rest, towards the Spring Glades, and her entry in the Book of Remembrance at the crematorium states:[116][117][af]\n Beryl May Dent 1900\u00a0\u2013 A real Christian loved by all\u00a0\u2013 1977. There is also a memorial to her in the Order of St\u00a0John, Hospitallers' Room, at St\u00a0Mary's Church, where a carver chair bears a brass plaque with the following inscription:[118][ag]\n In loving memory of Beryl Dent 1900\u00a0\u2013 1977. Dent never married, believing that getting married, and the subsequent pressures of family responsibilities, would be a \"wastage\" of a woman's training. However, she also believed that women leaving employment to get married would mean promotion opportunities for other women, and that married women would still be able to return to work in mid-life.[119] Her Christian faith is perhaps not surprising, given her father's work for the church in Warminster, and the era she grew up in, where religion pervaded social and political life.[120][121] However, it is notable that she remained a committed Christian while pursuing a scientific career. According to Steven Weinberg, science offers no support for belief in God, and that belief in God is unnecessary; a view shared by other scientists. However, Steve Ball, in an article that supports the science of prominent atheistic scientists, states that physics can actually fit well with biblical faith.[122][123]:2[ah]\n In 1928, Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent published two papers, Cohesion at a crystal surface (1928) and The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary (1928), that for the first time, outlined a calculation of the potential of the electric field in a vacuum, produced by a thin sodium chloride crystal surface.[74][75] They gave an expression for the electric potential produced by a system of point charges in vacuum (although not a real cubic sodium chloride ionic lattice).[124]:796\u2013797 The expression for the potential in vacuum, \n\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n0\n\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varphi _{0}\\left(r\\right)}\n\n, at the point r = {x, y, z}, near the cubic lattice of point ions with different signs, the charge \n\n\n\n\ne\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e_{k}}\n\n, and the period a (a crystalline solid is distinguished by the fact that the atoms making up the crystal are arranged in a periodic fashion), can be represented in the form:[124]:797\n \n\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n0\n\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nl\n,\nm\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n)\n\n\ns\n\n\nexp\n\u2061\n\n[\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\na\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nl\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\nz\n+\n\nz\n\ns\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n|\n\nk\n\nl\n,\nm\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n\n\n\ne\n\nk\n\n\ncos\n\u2061\n\n[\n\n\nk\n\nl\n,\nm\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\n\u2225\n\n\n\u2212\n\nr\n\nk\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varphi _{0}\\left(r\\right)={\\frac {2\\pi }{a^{2}}}\\sum _{l,m}\\sum _{s}{\\frac {\\left(-1\\right)^{s}\\exp \\left[-\\left({\\frac {2\\pi }{a}}\\right){\\sqrt {l^{2}+m^{2}}}\\left(z+z_{s}\\right)\\right]}{\\left|k_{l,m}\\right|}}\\times \\sum _{k}e_{k}\\cos \\left[k_{l,m}\\left(r_{\\parallel }-r_{k}\\right)\\right]}\n\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (1) The expression sums the set of potential static charges for the surface and lower layers of the crystal. Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent showed that this expression forms a rapidly convergent Fourier series.[124]:797 Harold Eugene Buckley, a crystallographic researcher at the University of Manchester until his death in 1959,[125]:481 had suggested that the results obtained in Cohesion at a crystal surface (1928), should be treated with caution. For example, the contraction a crystal plane would suffer under the conditions prescribed would not be the same as that of a similar plane with a solid mass of crystal behind it. Another difficulty arises because calculation of crystal surface field force fields are so great that simplifying assumptions have to be made to render them capable of a solution.[126] However, later work by Cleveland, Radmacher, and Hansma, in Atomic Scale Force Mapping with the Atomic Force Microscope (1994), has shown that the Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent paper had direct application to atomic force microscopy by predicting that non-contact imaging is possible only at small tip-sample separations.[127]\n Richard J. Smith has stated that Dent, in On observations of points connected by a linear relation (1935), was the first to develop a reduced major axis (RMA) regressiom method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock in A Problem in Least Squares (1878) and Charles Kummell in Reduction of observation equations which contain more than one observed quantity (1879).[93][94] The theoretical underpinnings of standard least squares regression analysis are based on the assumption that the independent variable (often labelled as x) is measured without error as a design variable. The dependent variable (labeled y) is modeled as having uncertainty or error. Both independent and dependent measurements may have multiple sources of error. Therefore, the underlying least squares regression assumptions can be violated. RMA regression is specifically formulated to handle errors in both the x and y variables.[128]:1 If the estimate of the ratio of the error variance of y to the error variance of x is denoted by \ud835\udf06, then the reduced major axis method assumes that \ud835\udf06 can be approximated by the ratio of the total variances of y and x.[129] RMA minimizes both vertical and horizontal distances of the data points from the predicted line (by summing areas) rather than the least squares sum of squared vertical (y-axis) distances.[128]:2\n Maurice Kendall and Alan Stuart showed that the maximum likelihood estimator of a likelihood function, depending on a parameter \n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta }\n\n, satisfies the following quadratic equation:[130]:387\n \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n2\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n+\n\n[\n\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\u2212\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n]\n\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta ^{2}x^{T}y+\\left[\\lambda x^{T}x-y^{T}y\\right]\\theta -\\lambda x^{T}y=0}\n\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (2) Using the quadratic formula to solve for the positive root (or zero) of (2):[131]\n \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nM\nL\n\n\n\u2261\n\n\n\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n+\n\n\n(\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n+\n4\n\u03bb\n(\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{ML}\\equiv {\\frac {y^{T}y-\\lambda x^{T}x+{\\sqrt {(y^{T}y-\\lambda x^{T}x)^{2}+4\\lambda (x^{T}y)^{2}}}}{2x^{T}y}}}\n\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (3) Inspection of (3) shows that as \ud835\udf06 tends to zero, the positive root tends to \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{y}}\n\n equal to \n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n/\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {y^{T}y}/{x^{T}y}}\n\n, and as \ud835\udf06 tends to plus infinity, the root tends to \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{x}}\n\n equal to \n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n/\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {x^{T}y}/{x^{T}x}}\n\n.[131] Dent had solved the maximum likelihood estimator in the case where the covariance matrix is not known, that is, when the variances in the x and y variables are unknown.[132]:1049 Dent's maximum likelihood estimator is the geometric mean of \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{x}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{y}}\n\n, equal to:[131]\n Dennis Lindley repeated Dent's analysis and stated that Dent's geometric mean estimator is not a consistent estimator for the likelihood function, [133]:235\u2013236, 241 and that the gradient of the estimate will have a bias, and this remains true even if the number of observations tends to infinity.[134]:15 Kenneth Alva Norton, a former consulting engineer with the then National Bureau of Standards, responded to Lindley, stating Lindley's own methods and assumptions lead to a biased prediction.[135] Furthermore, Albert Madansky noted that Lindley took the wrong root for the quadratic in (2) for the case where \n\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{T}y}\n\n is negative.[136]:201\u2013203 Subsequently, Theodore Anderson pointed out that the likelihood function has no maximum in this case, and therefore, there is no maximum likelihood estimator.[137]:3\n Although Dent's solution has its theoretical limitations, it is of practical importance, as it likely represents the best a priori estimate if nothing is known about the true error distribution in the model. It is generally much less reasonable to assume that all the error, or residual scatter, is attributable to one of the variables.[134]:3[129]\n In the 1950s, British electrical engineers would rarely use a digital computer, and if they did, it would be to solve some complicated equation outside the scope of analogue computers. To a certain extent, engineers were deterred by the difficulty and the time taken to program a particular problem. Furthermore, the varied and often unique problems that arise in electrical design practice, together with the degree of uncertainty of the numerical data of many problems, accentuated this tendency.[138] On 10 April 1956, Dent and Brian Birtwistle presented their paper, The digital computer as an aid to the electrical design engineer (1956), to the Convention on Digital Computer Techniques at the Institution of Electrical Engineers.[138] The paper was intended to show, by describing three relatively simple applications, that the digital computer could be a useful aid to the electrical design engineer. The three example problems were:\n The Manchester University Ferranti Mark 1 computer was used for the calculations in the three problems. Dent was allowed to use the University's library of subroutines, from which the following were taken and incorporated into the programs:[140]\n \n \n Their paper was one of the first to recognise that high speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer by carrying out automatically the optimum design of products.[103] Significant research had been devoted to determining a transformer's internal transient voltage distribution. Early attempts were hampered by computational limitations encountered when solving large numbers of coupled differential equations with analogue computers.[141] It was not until Dent, with Hartill and Miles, in A method of analysis of transformer impulse voltage distribution using a digital computer (1958), recognised the limitations of the analogue models and developed a digital computer model, and associated program, where non-uniformity in the transformer windings could be introduced and any input voltage applied.[142]\n The surface plane of a face-centred cubic lattice was derived by Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent and has been used extensively in physisorption studies. They simplified the calculation of the Lennard-Jones potential by noting that the ions under study were isoelectronic with inert gas atoms, and thus, there was no need to introduce additional empirical L\u2011J parameters into the equation.\nIn rock-salt or sodium chloride (halite) structure, each of the two atom types forms a separate face-centred cubic lattice. Examples of compounds with this structure include sodium chloride itself, along with the other alkali halides, and divalent metal oxides, sulphides, selenides, and tellurides.[145]:16[146][147]:682\u2013683\n ", "tags": ["1900 births", "1977 deaths", "20th-century British physicists", "20th-century British women scientists", "20th-century English mathematicians", "20th-century women engineers", "Alumni of Newnham College, Cambridge", "Alumni of the University of Bristol", "British women computer scientists", "British women engineers", "British women mathematicians", "English Anglicans", "English librarians", "English physicists", "English women physicists", "Mathematical physicists", "People from Warminster", "Theoretical chemists", "Theoretical physicists", "Women's Engineering Society", "Women librarians", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Good articles", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use British English from November 2020", "Use dmy dates from November 2020", "Pages with timeline metadata", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using multiple image with auto scaled images", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nEnglish mathematical physicist (1900\u20131977)\n\n\nBeryl May DentMIEEDent in 1928Born(1900-05-10)10 May 1900Chippenham, Wiltshire, EnglandDied9 August 1977(1977-08-09) (aged\u00a077)Sompting, West Sussex, EnglandNationalityBritishAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Bristol (1927\u00a0(1927): MSc)Newnham College, CambridgeAwards1923\u00a0(1923): Ashworth Hallett scholarshipScientific careerFieldsComputer-aided engineeringMolecular physicsRegression analysis\n\nOther fields\nIntermolecular forcesSemiconductor materialsTechnical library servicesThin filmsValency\nInstitutionsUniversity of Bristol Physics DepartmentMetropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company LtdAcademic advisorsJohn Lennard-Jones\n\nBeryl May Dent MIEE (10 May 1900\u00a0\u2013 9 August 1977) was an English mathematical physicist, technical librarian, and a programmer of early analogue and digital computers to solve electrical engineering problems. She was born in Chippenham, Wiltshire, the eldest daughter of schoolteachers. The family left Chippenham in 1901, after her father became head teacher of the then recently established Warminster County School. She graduated from the University of Bristol in 1923 with First Class Honours in applied mathematics. She was awarded the Ashworth Hallett scholarship by the university and was accepted as a postgraduate student at Newnham College, Cambridge.\nShe returned to Bristol in 1925, after being appointed a researcher in the Physics Department at the University of Bristol, with her salary being paid by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1927, John Lennard\u2011Jones was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics. Lennard\u2011Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and she became one of his first collaborators. They published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, that were to become the foundation of her master's thesis. Later work has shown that the results they obtained had direct application to atomic force microscopy by predicting that non-contact imaging is possible only at small tip-sample separations.\nIn 1930, she joined Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company Ltd, Manchester, as a technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff of the research department. She became active in the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB) and was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the Lancashire and Cheshire branch of the association. She served on various ASLIB committees and made conference presentations detailing different aspects of the company's library and information service. She continued to publish scientific papers, contributing numerical methods for solving differential equations by the use of the differential analyser that was built for the University of Manchester and Douglas Hartree. She was the first to develop a detailed reduced major axis method for the best fit of a series of data points.\nLater in her career she became leader of the computation section at Metropolitan-Vickers, and then a supervisor in the research department for the section that was investigating semiconducting materials. She joined the Women's Engineering Society and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design. She retired in 1960, with Isabel Hardwich, later a fellow and president of the Women's Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department. In 1962, she moved with her mother and sister to Sompting, West Sussex, and died there in 1977.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Education\n\n2.1 Warminster County School\n2.2 University of Bristol\n2.3 Newnham College, Cambridge\n\n\n3 Career\n\n3.1 University of Bristol Department of Physics\n3.2 Metropolitan-Vickers\n\n\n4 Later life and death\n5 Legacy\n\n5.1 Atomic force microscopy\n5.2 Reduced major axis regression\n5.3 Electrical design using digital computers\n\n\n6 Publications\n\n6.1 Selected papers and academic articles\n6.2 Publications detail\n\n6.2.1 Dent\n6.2.2 Dent as mathematician and programmer\n6.2.3 ASLIB\n6.2.4 Women's Engineering Society\n\n\n\n\n7 See also\n8 Footnotes\n9 References\n10 Bibliography\n11 Further reading\n12 External links\n\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\n The family lived at Boreham Road before moving in 1907 to 22 Portway, Chippenham\nBeryl May was born on (1900-05-10)10 May 1900, at Penley Villa, Park Lane, Chippenham, Wiltshire, the eldest daughter of Agnes Dent (1869\u20131967), n\u00e9e\u00a0Thornley, and Eustace Edward (1868\u20131954).[1] She was baptised at St\u00a0Paul's, Chippenham, on 8 June 1900.[2]:1 They had married at St Mary's Church, Goosnargh, near Preston, Lancashire, on 27\u00a0July 1898.[3] Thornley was educated at the Harris Institute, Preston, passing examinations in science and art.[4] She was a teacher at Attercliffe School, in northeast Sheffield, before moving to Goosnargh School, near her hometown of Preston, where her elder brother and sister, John William and Mary Ann Thornley, were the head teachers.[5][6] In March 1894, she had applied for the headship at Fairfield School, Cockermouth, making the shortlist, but the board decided to appoint a local candidate.[7]\nOn 18\u00a0March 1889, Dent's father was appointed to a teaching assistant position at Portland Road School, in Calderdale, Halifax, after completing a teaching apprenticeship with the school board.[8][9] In the same year, Florence Emily Dent, her father's elder sister, was appointed head teacher at West Vale girls' school, Stainland Road, Greetland, moving from the Higher Board School at Halifax.[10] In August 1889, he obtained a first class pass in mathematics from the Halifax Mechanics' Institute.[11][a] He then enrolled on a degree course at University College, Aberystwyth, in the Education Day Training College.[b] In January 1894, he was awarded a first by Aberystwyth, and a first in the external University of London examinations.[13][14][c] His first teaching post was at Coopers' Company Grammar School, Bow, London,[15] before moving to Chippenham, where he was a senior assistant teacher at the Chippenham County School. After five years at Chippenham, he left in October 1901 to become head teacher of the then recently established Warminster County School, that adjoined the Athenaeum Theatre in Warminster.[16][17][18][d] He was chair of the Warminster Urban District Council from 1920 to 1922,[e] and remained as head teacher of the County School until his retirement in August 1929.[22][21][f]\nAfter moving from Chippenham, the family lived at Boreham Road, Warminster, where houses were built in the early 19th century.[25][26][g] In April 1907, the family moved to 22 Portway, Warminster, situated a short distance from the County School and the Athenaeum.[20]:264[27] Her father was a regular cast member of the Warminster Operatic Society at the Athenaeum and other venues. Dent and her younger sister, Florence Mary, would often appear with him on stage in such operettas as Snow White and the seven dwarfs  and the Princess Ju\u2011Ju (The Golden Amulet), a Japanese operetta in three acts by Clementine Ward.[28][29][30] In Princess Ju\u2011Ju, she played La La, one of the three maidens attendant on the Princess Ju\u2011Ju, and sang the first act solo, She must be demure.[31][32] In act two of the same musical, she performed in the fan dance, Spirits of the Night.[29][32][h] She also acted in a scene from Tennyson's Princess at the County School's prize giving day on 16\u00a0December 1913.[35][i]\n\nEducation[edit]\nWarminster County School[edit]\n Former Warminster County School, where Dent was educated and her father was head teacher\nDent was educated at Warminster County School, where her father was head teacher. At school, she was close friends with her neighbour at Portway, Evelyn Mary Day, the eldest daughter of Henry George Day, a former butler to Colonel Charles Gathorne Gathorne\u2011Hardy, son of Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook.[37][38][j] In August 1914, she passed the University of Oxford Junior Local Examination with First Class Honours, and on the strength of her examination result, she was awarded a scholarship by the County School. In 1915, she passed the senior examination with second class honours and a distinction in French, and subsequently, her scholarship was renewed.[39][40][41] She then joined the sixth form and won the school prize for French in December 1916.[42][k] In March 1918, she applied for a scholarship in mathematics from Somerville College, Oxford, one of the first two women's colleges in Oxford. She was highly commended but was not awarded a scholarship nor an exhibition.[43]\n\nUniversity of Bristol[edit]\n Paul Dirac, Dent's fellow student on the honours course in mathematics at Bristol\n In 1923, Dent was accepted as a postgraduate research student by Newnham College, Cambridge\nDent was accepted on to the general Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree course at the University of Bristol and passed her intermediate degree examinations in June 1920.[l] For the following academic year, she took the honours course in mathematics at Bristol.[45] After spending the summer of 1921 at her parent's home in Warminster,[46] she returned for the start of the 1921 to 1922 academic year to find that Paul Dirac had joined the mathematics course.[47][m] Dent and Dirac were taught applied mathematics by Henry Ronald Hass\u00e9, the then head of the Mathematics Department, and pure mathematics by Peter Fraser. Both of them had come from Cambridge.[47] Fraser introduced them to mathematical rigour, projective geometry, and rigorous proofs in differential and integral calculus.[48][n] Dent studied four courses in pure mathematics:\n\nGeometry of conics; Differential geometry of plane curvesAlgebra and trigonometry; Differential and integral calculusAnalytical projective geometry of conicsDifferential equations; Solid geometry.[49]\nThere was a choice of specialisation in the final year; applied or pure mathematics. As the only official, registered fee-paying student, Dent had the right to choose, and she settled on applied mathematics for the final year. The department could offer only one set of lectures so Dirac also had to follow the same course.[50][o] Dent studied four courses in applied mathematics:\n\nElementary dynamics of a particle and of rigid bodiesGraphical and analytical statics; HydrostaticsDynamics of a particle and of rigid bodiesElementary theory of potential with applications to electricity and magnetism.[49]\nNewnham College, Cambridge[edit]\nIn June 1923, she graduated with Dirac, gaining a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in applied mathematics with First Class Honours.[51][47][p] On 7\u00a0July 1923, she was awarded the Ashworth Hallett scholarship by the University of Bristol and was accepted as a postgraduate student at Newnham College, Cambridge.[50][52][53][q] Dent spent a year at Cambridge, leaving in 1924 without further academic qualification, prior to being appointed to a temporary position teaching science at Barnsley Girls' High School, Huddersfield Road, Barnsley.[53] Before 1948, Cambridge University denied women graduates a degree, although in the same year as Dent left Cambridge, Katharine Margaret Wilson was the first woman to be awarded a PhD by the university.[55][r]\n\nCareer[edit]\nUniversity of Bristol Department of Physics[edit]\nSee \u00a7\u00a0Publications for details of Dent's academic papers\n H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory, University of Bristol, where Dent worked as a researcher\n John Edward Lennard\u2011Jones, Dent's advisor and co-author at Bristol in the 1920s\nIn 1925, Dent was appointed a researcher in the Physics Department at the University of Bristol, with her salary being paid by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the forerunner of the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC).[57]:107[53][s] In 1924, the University of Bristol Council had set aside a portion of a bequest from Henry Herbert Wills for the Department of Physics where Arthur Mannering Tyndall was building up a staff for teaching and research in the H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory, Royal Fort House Gardens.[59][t] From August 1925, John Lennard\u2011Jones, Trinity College, Cambridge, was elected Reader in Mathematical Physics.[61][59] In March 1927, Lennard\u2011Jones was appointed Professor of Theoretical physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics.[62][63]:24[64][u] Lennard\u2011Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and Dent became one of his first collaborators.[59][47]\nLennard\u2011Jones and Dent published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, with the objective of calculating theoretically the properties of carbonate and nitrate crystals.[47][65] Dent's thesis for her master's degree, Some theoretical determinations of crystal structure (1927), was the basis of the three papers that followed in 1927; with Lennard\u2011Jones, Crystal parameters, and with Lennard\u2011Jones and Sydney Chapman, Structure of carbonate crystals (1927) and Part II. Structure of carbonate crystals (1927).[v] On 28\u00a0June 1927, she was awarded a MSc degree for her thesis and research work.[66] In 1927, the physics laboratory at Bristol had a surplus of funds, and so it was decided that the funds would be used to provide more technical help.[w] Consequently, Dent was asked to combine her research duties with the post of part-time departmental librarian, the first appointment of librarian in the Department of Physics.[63]:26[1][x]\nDent was now living at Clifton Hill House, the university hall of residence for women in Clifton.[67][y] She had been appointed honorary secretary of the Bristol Cheeloo Association by March 1926.[70] The association's aim was to raise sufficient funds to support a chair of chemistry at Cheeloo University.[67] In an effort to publicise the cause and raise money, she presented to the local branch of the Women's International League in October 1928.[71] In 1927, she was one of eleven people elected to the standing committee of the University of Bristol's Convocation, the university's alumni association, and later, represented the Manchester branch of the association.[72][73][68] In 1928, Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent published two papers, Cohesion at a crystal surface (1928), and with Sydney Chapman, The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary (1928), that studied the force fields on a thin crystal cleavage.[74][75] Around this time, quantum mechanics was developed to become the standard formulation for atomic physics.[z] Lennard\u2011Jones left Bristol in 1929 to study the subject for a year as a Rockefeller Fellow at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.[77]\nWith her collaborator and advisor in Germany, Dent wrote one last paper before leaving the physics department at Bristol: The effect of boundary distortion on the surface energy of a crystal (1929) examined the effect of the polarisation of surface ions in decreasing the surface energy of alkali halides.[78] In December 1929, she resigned her position and it was accepted with regret by the Council of the University of Bristol.[79] She left Bristol for Stretford, Manchester, to become the technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff in the research department at Metropolitan-Vickers.[80]:232 In 1930, Lennard\u2011Jones returned to Bristol, as Dean of the Faculty of Science, and introduced the new quantum theories to the Bristol group.[77][59][aa] Marjorie Josephine Littleton was appointed as Dent's replacement on the 1\u00a0February 1930. She was the daughter of a local Bristol councillor and a graduate of Girton College, Cambridge. She was later Sir Neville Mott's co-author and research assistant in the physics department.[82][83]:517\n\nMetropolitan-Vickers[edit]\nMetropolitan-Vickers was a British heavy industrial firm, based at Trafford Park, Manchester. They were well known for industrial electrical equipment and generators, street lighting, electronics, steam turbines and diesel locomotives. They built the Metrovick 950, the first commercial transistorised computer.[84] In 1917, a Research and Education Department was established at the Trafford Park site, when the care of the library came within the remit of James George Pearce, a former engineer in the Transformer Department.[ab] He made the library the centre of a new technical intelligence section. In 1929, the technical intelligence section was substantially reorganised and expanded, and placed under the directorship of James Steele Park Paton.[80]:193[85] In January 1930, Dent joined the senior scientific and technical staff in the research at department Metropolitan-Vickers.[63]:49[80]:193 Technical librarianship emerged as a new scientific career in interwar Britain and rapidly became one of the few types of professional industrial employment that was routinely open to both women and men.[86]:301\nBy 1933, the Metropolitan-Vickers library had 3,000 engineering volumes and around the same number in pamphlets and patent specifications.[87] Besides covering electrical subjects, the library covered accountancy, employment questions, and subjects of interest to the sales department. It also issued a weekly bulletin, scrutinised patents, handled patents taken out by research staff, and exchanged information with associated companies.[88] From 1931 to 1936, Dent was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the Lancashire and Cheshire branch of the ASLIB.[89]:204\u2013205 In 1932, the branch had twenty six members and had organised four meetings, including one addressed by Sir Henry Tizard, the then President of ASLIB. After the war, it formed the basis for the Northern Branch of the association.[90]:412 She was also a delegate at the fourteenth International Conference on Documentation and was invited to the Government's conference dinner on 22\u00a0September 1938 at the Great Dining Hall of Christ Church, Oxford.[91][ac] She served on various ASLIB committees and made conference presentations detailing different aspects of the company's library and information service.[80]:228[92]\n\n Differential analyser designed by Douglas Hartree, at the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester\nDent continued to publish papers in applied mathematics and contribute to papers on emerging computational technologies. In On observations of points connected by a linear relation (1935), she developed a detailed reduced major axis method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock and Charles Kummell.[93][94] For Myers, Hartree, and Porter, in The Effect of Space-Charge on the Secondary Current in a Triode (1937), she provided the key numerical integrations for differential equations to aid in the calculation of the space charge limitation of secondary current using a differential analyser.[95] In 1946, she was promoted to section leader of the company's new computation section. Her knowledge of higher mathematics meant that she was often asked to check the mathematics in papers for publication by engineers at Metropolitan-Vickers. For example, Cyril Frederick Gradwell, a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, asked her to scrutinise the algebraic part of his work in The Solution of a problem in disk bending occurring in connexion with gas turbines (1950).[96][ad]\nIn the latter half of her career, Dent became the section leader for the women in the research department that were working on semiconducting materials.[80]:233 She performed the Fourier analysis in Shorting and Field Corrections in Hall Measurements (1954), that developed a method for correcting the measured Hall effect in semiconductors for inhomogeneities in the applied magnetic field.[98] In 1958, she carried out computer calculations for the mechanical engineering team at the Nuclear Power Group, Radbroke Hall. Their paper outlined a procedure for calculating the theoretical deflection (bending) of a circular grid of support girders for a graphite neutron moderator in a gas-cooled reactor.[99] A general expression was derived from the central deflection of the grid and the maximum bending moment on the central cross-beam for a range of grid diameters.[100]\nDent joined the Women's Engineering Society and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design.[101][102] With Brian Birtwistle, she wrote programs for the Manchester University Ferranti Mark 1, that demonstrated that high speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer.[103] Birtwistle would later have an extensive career in the computer industry, working at, amongst others, Honeywell Information Systems and ADP Network Services.[104] She retired from Metropolitan-Vickers in May 1960, with Isabel Hardwich, later a fellow and president of the Women's Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department.[105][106]:243\n\nLater life and death[edit]\nChurch of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, SomptingWorthing CrematoriumDent's funeral was held at St\u00a0Mary's and a memorial to her is located in the Hospitallers' Room there. Her ashes are interred at Worthing Crematorium.\nDent's father died on (1954-06-24)24 June 1954, at their shared home, 529 King's Road, Stretford, with the funeral service taking place at St\u00a0Matthew's Church, Stretford.[107] Dent had close links to St\u00a0Matthew's; from 1956 to 1962, she served as a school manager for St\u00a0Matthew's Church of England Primary School at Poplar Road, Stretford.[53] In 1962, she and her elderly mother, Agnes, moved from Stretford to 1 Cokeham Road, Sompting, a village in the coastal Adur District of West Sussex, between Lancing and Worthing.[108][109] Agnes died on (1967-04-05)5 April 1967 and was cremated at the Downs Crematorium on 10 April 1967.[110][ae]\nDent died at her home in Sompting on 9 August 1977(1977-08-09) (aged\u00a077).[113][114] She donated her body for medical examination, on the understanding that her remains would be returned for a funeral service at St\u00a0Mary's Church, Sompting, followed by cremation.[115] Her ashes were interred at Worthing Crematorium, in the Gardens of Rest, towards the Spring Glades, and her entry in the Book of Remembrance at the crematorium states:[116][117][af]\n\nBeryl May Dent 1900\u00a0\u2013 A real Christian loved by all\u00a0\u2013 1977.\nThere is also a memorial to her in the Order of St\u00a0John, Hospitallers' Room, at St\u00a0Mary's Church, where a carver chair bears a brass plaque with the following inscription:[118][ag]\n\nIn loving memory of Beryl Dent 1900\u00a0\u2013 1977.\nDent never married, believing that getting married, and the subsequent pressures of family responsibilities, would be a \"wastage\" of a woman's training. However, she also believed that women leaving employment to get married would mean promotion opportunities for other women, and that married women would still be able to return to work in mid-life.[119] Her Christian faith is perhaps not surprising, given her father's work for the church in Warminster, and the era she grew up in, where religion pervaded social and political life.[120][121] However, it is notable that she remained a committed Christian while pursuing a scientific career. According to Steven Weinberg, science offers no support for belief in God, and that belief in God is unnecessary; a view shared by other scientists. However, Steve Ball, in an article that supports the science of prominent atheistic scientists, states that physics can actually fit well with biblical faith.[122][123]:2[ah]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nAtomic force microscopy[edit]\n An atomic force microscope on the left with controlling computer on the right. Dent's work had direct application to the development of atomic force microscopy\nIn 1928, Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent published two papers, Cohesion at a crystal surface (1928) and The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary (1928), that for the first time, outlined a calculation of the potential of the electric field in a vacuum, produced by a thin sodium chloride crystal surface.[74][75] They gave an expression for the electric potential produced by a system of point charges in vacuum (although not a real cubic sodium chloride ionic lattice).[124]:796\u2013797 The expression for the potential in vacuum, \n\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n0\n\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varphi _{0}\\left(r\\right)}\n\n, at the point r = {x, y, z}, near the cubic lattice of point ions with different signs, the charge \n\n\n\n\ne\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e_{k}}\n\n, and the period a (a crystalline solid is distinguished by the fact that the atoms making up the crystal are arranged in a periodic fashion), can be represented in the form:[124]:797\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n0\n\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nl\n,\nm\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n)\n\n\ns\n\n\nexp\n\u2061\n\n[\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\na\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nl\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\nz\n+\n\nz\n\ns\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n|\n\nk\n\nl\n,\nm\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n\n\n\ne\n\nk\n\n\ncos\n\u2061\n\n[\n\n\nk\n\nl\n,\nm\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\n\u2225\n\n\n\u2212\n\nr\n\nk\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varphi _{0}\\left(r\\right)={\\frac {2\\pi }{a^{2}}}\\sum _{l,m}\\sum _{s}{\\frac {\\left(-1\\right)^{s}\\exp \\left[-\\left({\\frac {2\\pi }{a}}\\right){\\sqrt {l^{2}+m^{2}}}\\left(z+z_{s}\\right)\\right]}{\\left|k_{l,m}\\right|}}\\times \\sum _{k}e_{k}\\cos \\left[k_{l,m}\\left(r_{\\parallel }-r_{k}\\right)\\right]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\u2225\n\n\n=\n\n{\n\nx\n,\ny\n\n}\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r_{\\parallel }=\\left\\{x,y\\right\\}}\n\n is the lateral vector that fixes the observation point coordinates in the sample plane.\n\n\n\n\n\nk\n\nl\n,\nm\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k_{l,m}}\n\n is the reciprocal lattice vector.\ns is the number of planes to be calculated inside the crystal; s set to zero would calculate the surface plane.\nThe expression sums the set of potential static charges for the surface and lower layers of the crystal. Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent showed that this expression forms a rapidly convergent Fourier series.[124]:797 Harold Eugene Buckley, a crystallographic researcher at the University of Manchester until his death in 1959,[125]:481 had suggested that the results obtained in Cohesion at a crystal surface (1928), should be treated with caution. For example, the contraction a crystal plane would suffer under the conditions prescribed would not be the same as that of a similar plane with a solid mass of crystal behind it. Another difficulty arises because calculation of crystal surface field force fields are so great that simplifying assumptions have to be made to render them capable of a solution.[126] However, later work by Cleveland, Radmacher, and Hansma, in Atomic Scale Force Mapping with the Atomic Force Microscope (1994), has shown that the Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent paper had direct application to atomic force microscopy by predicting that non-contact imaging is possible only at small tip-sample separations.[127]\n\nReduced major axis regression[edit]\nRichard J. Smith has stated that Dent, in On observations of points connected by a linear relation (1935), was the first to develop a reduced major axis (RMA) regressiom method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock in A Problem in Least Squares (1878) and Charles Kummell in Reduction of observation equations which contain more than one observed quantity (1879).[93][94] The theoretical underpinnings of standard least squares regression analysis are based on the assumption that the independent variable (often labelled as x) is measured without error as a design variable. The dependent variable (labeled y) is modeled as having uncertainty or error. Both independent and dependent measurements may have multiple sources of error. Therefore, the underlying least squares regression assumptions can be violated. RMA regression is specifically formulated to handle errors in both the x and y variables.[128]:1 If the estimate of the ratio of the error variance of y to the error variance of x is denoted by \ud835\udf06, then the reduced major axis method assumes that \ud835\udf06 can be approximated by the ratio of the total variances of y and x.[129] RMA minimizes both vertical and horizontal distances of the data points from the predicted line (by summing areas) rather than the least squares sum of squared vertical (y-axis) distances.[128]:2\n\n Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation (straight line) to observed data\nMaurice Kendall and Alan Stuart showed that the maximum likelihood estimator of a likelihood function, depending on a parameter \n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta }\n\n, satisfies the following quadratic equation:[130]:387\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n2\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n+\n\n[\n\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\u2212\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n]\n\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta ^{2}x^{T}y+\\left[\\lambda x^{T}x-y^{T}y\\right]\\theta -\\lambda x^{T}y=0}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n(2)\n\nwhere x and y are the \n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {X} }\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {Y} }\n\n vectors in a covariance matrix giving the covariance between each pair of x and y variables.\nUsing the quadratic formula to solve for the positive root (or zero) of (2):[131]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nM\nL\n\n\n\u2261\n\n\n\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n+\n\n\n(\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n+\n4\n\u03bb\n(\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{ML}\\equiv {\\frac {y^{T}y-\\lambda x^{T}x+{\\sqrt {(y^{T}y-\\lambda x^{T}x)^{2}+4\\lambda (x^{T}y)^{2}}}}{2x^{T}y}}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n(3)\n\nInspection of (3) shows that as \ud835\udf06 tends to zero, the positive root tends to \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{y}}\n\n equal to \n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n/\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {y^{T}y}/{x^{T}y}}\n\n, and as \ud835\udf06 tends to plus infinity, the root tends to \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{x}}\n\n equal to \n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n/\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {x^{T}y}/{x^{T}x}}\n\n.[131] Dent had solved the maximum likelihood estimator in the case where the covariance matrix is not known, that is, when the variances in the x and y variables are unknown.[132]:1049 Dent's maximum likelihood estimator is the geometric mean of \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{x}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{y}}\n\n, equal to:[131]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nM\nL\n\n\n\u2261\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{ML}\\equiv {\\sqrt {\\left({\\frac {y^{T}y}{x^{T}x}}\\right)}}}\n\n, where \n\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{T}y}\n\n is positive.\nDennis Lindley repeated Dent's analysis and stated that Dent's geometric mean estimator is not a consistent estimator for the likelihood function, [133]:235\u2013236, 241 and that the gradient of the estimate will have a bias, and this remains true even if the number of observations tends to infinity.[134]:15 Kenneth Alva Norton, a former consulting engineer with the then National Bureau of Standards, responded to Lindley, stating Lindley's own methods and assumptions lead to a biased prediction.[135] Furthermore, Albert Madansky noted that Lindley took the wrong root for the quadratic in (2) for the case where \n\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{T}y}\n\n is negative.[136]:201\u2013203 Subsequently, Theodore Anderson pointed out that the likelihood function has no maximum in this case, and therefore, there is no maximum likelihood estimator.[137]:3\nAlthough Dent's solution has its theoretical limitations, it is of practical importance, as it likely represents the best a priori estimate if nothing is known about the true error distribution in the model. It is generally much less reasonable to assume that all the error, or residual scatter, is attributable to one of the variables.[134]:3[129]\n\nElectrical design using digital computers[edit]\nIn the 1950s, British electrical engineers would rarely use a digital computer, and if they did, it would be to solve some complicated equation outside the scope of analogue computers. To a certain extent, engineers were deterred by the difficulty and the time taken to program a particular problem. Furthermore, the varied and often unique problems that arise in electrical design practice, together with the degree of uncertainty of the numerical data of many problems, accentuated this tendency.[138] On 10 April 1956, Dent and Brian Birtwistle presented their paper, The digital computer as an aid to the electrical design engineer (1956), to the Convention on Digital Computer Techniques at the Institution of Electrical Engineers.[138] The paper was intended to show, by describing three relatively simple applications, that the digital computer could be a useful aid to the electrical design engineer. The three example problems were:\n\nImpulse voltage distribution on transformer windingsSupply frequency ripple on transductor performanceStarting torque of a synchronous motor.[139]\n Illustration of transformer windings\nThe Manchester University Ferranti Mark 1 computer was used for the calculations in the three problems. Dent was allowed to use the University's library of subroutines, from which the following were taken and incorporated into the programs:[140]\n\n\n\n\nInput of instructions.Input of numerical data in decimal form.Output of results in decimal digits and tabular form.\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical functions.\nDivision.Exponential.Sine and cosine.Square root.Solution of simultaneous equations.Inversion of matrices.Integration of differential equations by Runge\u2013Kutta methods.\n\n\n\n\nTheir paper was one of the first to recognise that high speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer by carrying out automatically the optimum design of products.[103] Significant research had been devoted to determining a transformer's internal transient voltage distribution. Early attempts were hampered by computational limitations encountered when solving large numbers of coupled differential equations with analogue computers.[141] It was not until Dent, with Hartill and Miles, in A method of analysis of transformer impulse voltage distribution using a digital computer (1958), recognised the limitations of the analogue models and developed a digital computer model, and associated program, where non-uniformity in the transformer windings could be introduced and any input voltage applied.[142]\n\nPublications[edit]\nSelected papers and academic articles[edit]\n\nTable of selected papers and academic articles\n\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nCo-author(s)\n\nNotes\n\n\n1926 \nThe forces between atoms and ions.

They simplified the calculation of the Lennard-Jones potential by noting that the ions under study were isoelectronic with inert gas atoms, and thus, there was no need to introduce additional empirical L\u2011J parameters into the equation.\nIn rock-salt or sodium chloride (halite) structure, each of the two atom types forms a separate face-centred cubic lattice. Examples of compounds with this structure include sodium chloride itself, along with the other alkali halides, and divalent metal oxides, sulphides, selenides, and tellurides.[145]:16[146][147]:682\u2013683\n\n\n\n1928 \nCohesion at a crystal surface\n\nJohn Edward Lennard\u2011Jones\n\nCalculation of the surface energy of solids.

It is shown that for a series of alkali halide crystals, it is the deformability of the surface ions which largely controls the distortion at the surface. In general, close-packing and wide inter-planar spacing tend to lower the free surface energy in crystals.[78][148]\n\n\n1933 \nThe technical news bulletin and house journal of the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company\n\nDent (sole\u00a0author)\n\nThere were eight contributors to the subject \"the preparation and production of information bulletins, house journals and reports\", which was presented at the general session of the tenth annual conference of the ASLIB on the morning of the 23\u00a0June 1933.[ai] James George Pearce, Dent's former technical director at Metropolitan-Vickers, was in the chair. Dent described the technical news bulletin and the house journal of Metropolitan-Vickers. The bulletins and journals contained references to current literature, abstracts, news of current interest, and select bibliographies. They were often duplicated owing to the prohibitive cost of printing: \"Don't press the printers\" was the advice of Dent.[149][150]\n\n\n1935 \nOn observations of points connected by a linear relation\n\nDent (sole\u00a0author)\n\nDent was the first to describe and develop a detailed reduced major axis method for line fitting. The paper was sent to the Physical Society by Henry Ronald Hass\u00e9, Dent's former professor of applied mathematics at Bristol, on 10\u00a0July 1934. The paper was refereed by Alexander Aitken, and at the time of publication, commented on by William Edwards Deming.[93][151]\n\n\n1946 \nThe library and information service of the Metropolitan-Vickers Co.

The digest contained about fifty brief abstracts on factory processes and workshop practice.[152]\n\n\n1946 \nWhat the industrialist expects of an information service\n\nSir Arthur Fleming\n\n On 14\u00a0September 1946, Dent and Fleming presented at the twenty first annual conference of ASLIB in the Fyvie Hall at the Polytechnic, Regent Street. They stressed the importance of new knowledge and ideas in industry as a condition of progress, and that industry required rapid, accurate, and comprehensive information.[153]\n\n\n1956 \nThe digital computer as an aid to the electrical design engineer\n\nBrian Birtwistle\n\nThe value of the digital computer as an aid to the electrical design engineer is discussed in the light of the authors' extensive use of the Ferranti Mark 1 computer.[aj] Three examples are described:[138]\nImpulse voltage distribution on transformer windings.[ak]Supply frequency ripple on transductor performance.Starting torque of a synchronous motor.\n\n\n1956 \nThe authors' replies to the discussion on 'Engineering and scientific applications of digital computers'\n\nBrian Birtwistle\n\nReplies to questions on the digital computer as an aid to the electrical design engineer.

See University of London Worldwide history of the external examination system.\n\n^ In 1897, the Government Education Inspectors insisted the Athenaeum must expand if it was to continue as a centre of learning. An initial plan to add a floor to the building was rejected in favour of adding a new adjoining building at a cost of \u00a33,000. The new school also made use of the first floor classrooms in the Athenaeum.[19][20]:263\n\n^ There is a portrait photograph of Eustace, as chair of the council, in the cafe area of the Civic Centre in Sambourne Road, Warminster.[21]\n\n^ The school closed at the end of the summer term 29\u00a0July 1931, after the Wiltshire County Council Education Authority built a new secondary school for Warminster.[23] The building was used as the town library until 1958, and then by Warminster Youth Centre, but is now owned and managed by the Athenaeum Trust.[24]\n\n^ A Warminster town guide of 1924 described Boreham Road as a modern residential quarter of semi-detached villas, pretty gardens, with a tree lined footpath blending the rural with the urban.[26]\n\n^ At the end of the musical, the national anthem of Japan was sung, followed by the British national anthem, and the flags of the Allies were waved from the stage.[29] The Belgian flag was held by a young refugee, Alphonse Cambier, who, with three others, were attending the County School.[29] Germany had invaded Belgium on 4\u00a0August 1914, forcing Belgians to flee, with the United Kingdom home to 250,000 Belgian refugees during World War I. Lord Bath placed his vacant houses in the district at their disposal. Amongst others, two large houses in Warminster were made available, one in the Market Place, and one in Silver Street.[33][34]\n\n^ A scene from Princess Ida, the comic opera adaptation by Gilbert and Sullivan.[36]\n\n^ Dent was a bridesmaid at Evelyn's wedding to Maurice Philip Young, a pharmacist, at the Minster Church of St\u00a0Denys, Warminster, on 7\u00a0June 1926. At the time of her marriage, Evelyn was an assistant mistress at the Central County School, Church Road, Bexleyheath. Dent wore printed silk, with a shaded hat to match, and pink pearls, the gift of the bridegroom. She was known to friends and family as May Dent.[37]\n\n^ Dent's sister, Florence Mary, won the same prize for the year below.[42]\n\n^ The University of Bristol was the first higher education institute in England to admit women on an equal basis to men.[44]\n\n^ The course of mathematics at Bristol University normally lasted three years, but because of Dirac's previous training, the Department of Mathematics had allowed him to join in the second year.[47]\n\n^ Dirac would later say that Peter Fraser was the best teacher he had ever had.[47]\n\n^ Her relations with Dirac were strictly formal; they seldom spoke to each other.[49]\n\n^ Dent's sister, Florence Mary, graduated at the same time with a Bachelor of Arts degree.[51]\n\n^ The scholarship was open to female graduates of a recognised college or university, and worth \u00a345 at the time.[54]\n\n^ Wilson later became a successful writer and poet. Wilson's dissertation, Music and English Poetry, featured at The Rising Tide: Women at Cambridge exhibition from October 2019.[55][56]\n\n^ Paul Dirac was also in receipt of a Research Council grant at this point with his research interests listed under Dent's entry in the Research Council's report for the year 1925 to 1926.[58]\n\n^ Tyndall became the \"father\" of the School of Physics. A lecturer and then professor who researched the mobility of ions in gases, Tyndall persuaded the Bristol industrialist Henry Herbert Wills to endow a purpose-built physics laboratory.[60]\n\n^ This was the first appointment of a professor of theoretical physics in the United Kingdom.[60]\n\n^ Sydney Chapman was Lennard\u2011Jones's PhD thesis advisor at Trinity College, Cambridge.[59]\n\n^ Despite the fact that the department had acquired a second professor and two research fellows.[63]:26\n\n^ The library had been named after Maria Mercer, the last surviving daughter of John Mercer, a Lancashire weaver who taught himself sufficient chemistry to be elected to a Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1852.[57]:3 Mercer was the inventor of the process of treating cotton known as mercerisation, and had amassed a considerable fortune. When Maria died, on 22\u00a0February 1913 at Clayton-le-Moors, aged 93, her trustees offered \"not less than \u00a35,000\" to the University of Bristol, towards the endowment of a Chair of Chemistry.[57]:3\n\n^ May Christophera Staveley was her warden and tutor at Clifton Hill House. Dent returned to Bristol on 22\u00a0December 1934 for Staveley's funeral.[68] Dent was a member of the Clifton Hill House Old Students Association.[69]\n\n^ See the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927.[76]\n\n^ In 1932, Lennard\u2011Jones was elected to the Plummer Chair of Theoretical Chemistry in the University of Cambridge: The first person to hold a Chair of Theoretical Chemistry anywhere in the world.[59] John Murrell has described Lennard\u2011Jones as \"the father of British quantum chemistry\".[81]\n\n^ Pearce was later a liaison engineer for European and American companies at Metropolitan-Vickers. He was also Director and Secretary of the British Cast Iron Research Association.[85]\n\n^ Earl Stanhope, President of the Board of Education, was in the chair at the dinner.[91]\n\n^ Along with Dent, Cyril Gradwell was one of the first programmers of the Ferranti Mark 1 computer. He wrote system software routines (for example Input G and Reciprocal G) that had advantages over the original versions written by Alan Turing. He wrote Mark I programs for Ferranti's guided missile work for the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough, and on cotton spinning applications for the British Cotton Industry Research Association's Shirley Institute at Didsbury.[97]\n\n^ Dent's sister, Florence Mary, also lived at the house until her death on 13 September 1986(1986-09-13) (aged\u00a084).[111] The move to Sompting was likely made after Florence retired from working life on 22\u00a0September 1961. She had been a secretary for the Withington Friendly Burial Collecting Society, Withington, and after its takeover in 1954, for Liverpool Victoria.[112]\n\n^ Dent is interred in row 11, plot 32, on a mowed lawn area, where the markers are in the form of small brass plaques set into the lawn, approximately 15 by 10\u00a0cm (6 by 4\u00a0in) in size. Dent's sister, Florence Mary, is also interred at the crematorium.[117]\n\n^ Similarly, Dent's mother, Agnes, is remembered on a brass plaque at the east end of the choir stall.[118]\n\n^ See also Has Physics Made Philosophy and Religion Obsolete? (2012) by Ross Andersen and David Albert's review of A Universe From Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing (2012) by Lawrence Krauss.\n\n^ The conference was held at the Wills Hall, University of Bristol, with Dent returning to Bristol for the first time since 1929 after resigning her position in the Physics Department.[149]\n\n^ See also the history of the transistor computer.\n\n^ See the 1958 paper, A method of analysis of transformer impulse voltage distribution using a digital computer.\n\n^ James George Miles served in the electrical branch of the Royal Naval Reserve, before studying at Brighton Technical College, graduating in 1948. After a college apprenticeship with Metropolitan-Vickers, he joined their staff at Manchester. He was awarded an Associated Electrical Industries Fellowship in 1950, and spent one year studying power-system analysis with British Thomson-Houston, before returning to Manchester.[156]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \nBeryl Dent at the University of Bristol Department of Physics (Document).
