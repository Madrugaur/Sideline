{"name": "Rudolf Jaenisch", "content": "\n Rudolf Jaenisch (born April 22, 1942) is a Professor of Biology at MIT and a founding member of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research.[1]  He is a pioneer of transgenic science, in which an animal\u2019s genetic makeup is altered. Jaenisch has focused on creating genetically modified mice to study cancer and neurological diseases.[2][3][4]\n Jaenisch\u2019s first breakthrough occurred in 1974 when he and Beatrice Mintz showed that foreign DNA could be integrated into the DNA of early mouse embryos.[5] They injected retrovirus DNA into early mouse embryos and showed that leukemia DNA sequences had integrated into the mouse genome and also to its offspring. These mice were the first transgenic mammals in history.[6]\n His current research focuses on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression,[7] which has led to major advances in creating embryonic stem cells and \u201cinduced pluripotent stem\" (IPS) cells, as well as their therapeutic applications. In 2007, Jaenisch\u2019s laboratory was one of the first three laboratories world-wide to report reprogramming cells taken from a mouse's tail into IPS cells. Jaenisch has since shown therapeutic benefits of IPS cell-based treatment for sickle-cell anemia and Parkinson's disease in mice. Additional research focuses on the epigenetic mechanisms involved in cancer and brain development.[3]\n Jaenisch\u2019s therapeutic cloning research deals exclusively with mice, but he is an advocate for using the same techniques with human cells in order to advance embryonic stem cell research.[8] However, in 2001 Jaenisch made a public case against human reproductive cloning, testifying to a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee[9] and an editorial in Science magazine.[10]\n Jaenisch received his doctorate in medicine from the University of Munich in 1967, preferring the laboratory to the clinic. He became a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, studying bacteriophages.[11] He left Germany in 1970 for research positions at Princeton University, Fox Chase Institute for Cancer Research and the Salk Institute. He returned to Germany in 1977 to become the head of the Department of Tumor Virology at the Heinrich Pette Institute at the University of Hamburg. He arrived at MIT in 1984.[12] He participated in the 2005 science conference on human cloning at the United Nations and serves on the science advisory boards of the Genetics Policy Institute[13] and Stemgent.[14]\n ", "tags": ["1942 births", "Living people", "Fellows of the AACR Academy", "German biologists", "German geneticists", "History of genetics", "Knights Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "Massry Prize recipients", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "People from Bystrzyca K\u0142odzka", "Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)", "Whitehead Institute faculty", "Wolf Prize in Medicine laureates", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "CS1: long volume value", "Use mdy dates from January 2021", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from April 2015", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nRudolf JaenischRudolf Jaenisch, 2003Born (1942-04-22) April 22, 1942 (age\u00a078)W\u00f6lfelsgrund, GermanyCitizenshipGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Munich (M.D., 1967)Known\u00a0for\nEpigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation\nTherapeutic cloning\nEmbryonic stem cell research\nAwardsBoehringer Mannheim Molecular Bioanalytics Prize (1996)[citation needed]\nGruber Prize in Genetics (2001)\nRobert Koch Prize (2002)\nMax Delbr\u00fcck Medal (2006)\nMassry Prize from the Keck School of Medicine (2008)\nWolf Prize in Medicine (2011)\nNational Medal of Science (2011)\nScientific careerFieldsBiochemistryGeneticsMedicineInstitutions\nMax Planck Institute for Biochemistry\nPrinceton University\nFox Chase Cancer Center\nSalk Institute\nHeinrich Pette Institute\nUniversity of Hamburg\nWhitehead Institute for Biomedical Research\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nAcademic advisorsArnold Levine\nWebsitewi.mit.edu/people/faculty/jaenisch\nRudolf Jaenisch (born April 22, 1942) is a Professor of Biology at MIT and a founding member of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research.[1]  He is a pioneer of transgenic science, in which an animal\u2019s genetic makeup is altered.
