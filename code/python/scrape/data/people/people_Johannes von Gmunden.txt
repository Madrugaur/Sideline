{"name": "Johannes von Gmunden", "content": "Johannes von Gmunden (Latin: Johannes de Gamundia; c. 1380/84 \u2013 February 23, 1442) was a German/Austrian astronomer, mathematician, humanist and early instrument maker.\n Johannes von Gmunden received the degree of a master of arts at the University of Vienna in 1406. From 1408, he was a lecturer at Vienna, lecturing on Aristotle's Physics (1408) and Meteora (1409, 1411), Peter of Spain (1410) and Algorismus de minutiis (1412). He fell seriously ill in 1412.\n In 1415 and 1416 studied theology, completing a Bachelor of Theology in 1416.[2] He continued lecturing only in 1419, on algorismus de integris. From 1420, Johannes was permitted to restrict his teaching to the specialized field of the mathematics of astronomy, focusing on Euclid's Elements and the Sphaera materialis of John Holywood. With the aid of students (Weidler's 1741 Historia astronomiae names Georg Pruneck of Ruspach, Georg of Neuenburg, Johannes Schinkel and Johannes Feldner) he compiled voluminous astronomical tables.
