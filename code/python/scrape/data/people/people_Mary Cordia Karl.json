{"name": "Mary Cordia Karl", "content": "Elizabeth Karl (Sister Mary Cordia) (16 November 1893 \u2013 30 August 1984[1]) was an American mathematician who contributed significantly to the theory of orthopoles in geometry.

A large summary of this work was published in the American Mathematical Monthly (June\u2013July 1932, pages 327\u2013338). The key idea is to associate a well chosen line-parabola to each ordinary line in the plane, in such a way that the orthopole of any element of the line-parabola belongs to initial line.  This correspondence can be illustrated by the following figure (where L is the line at infinity and A1, A2, A3 the base triangle):\n Such a projective apparatus makes it possible, given a point in the plane, to determine the lines that admit this point as orthopole.  In the general case, there are four of them (including the line at infinity and the complex lines if any).\n ", "tags": ["1893 births", "1984 deaths", "American women mathematicians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Notre Dame of Maryland University", "Educators from Maryland", "American women educators", "Johns Hopkins University alumni", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Place of birth missing", "Place of death missing"], "raw": "American mathematician\nElizabeth Karl (Sister Mary Cordia) (16 November 1893 \u2013 30 August 1984[1]) was an American mathematician who contributed significantly to the theory of orthopoles in geometry.
