{"name": "Niccol\u00f2 di Giovanni Fiorentino", "content": "Niccol\u00f2 di Giovanni Fiorentino (Croatian: Nikola Firentinac) called Nicolas of Florence (Bagno a Ripoli, 1418 - \u0160ibenik, 1506), was an Italian Renaissance sculptor and architect, active in Venice and Dalmatia.\n He is best known by his work on the \u0160ibenik Cathedral of St James, in 1455. After the death of Giorgio da Sebenico, Niccol\u00f2 finished the cathedral and its original stone dome, following the original plans of Giorgio.  \n Before 1457 he probably worked with Donatello in Padua, between 1457 and 1468 was active in Venice but moved after to Dalmatia where he worked until his death in 1506.\n Work on \u0160ibenik cathedral inspired Niccol\u00f2 for his work on the expansion of chapel of Blessed John from Trogir in 1468. Just like the \u0160ibenik cathedral, it was composed of large stone blocks with extreme precision. In cooperation with a disciple of Giorgio, Andrea Alessi, Niccol\u00f2 achieved close harmony of architecture and sculpture according to antique ideals. From inside, there is no flat wall. In the middle of chapel, on the altar, lies the sarcophagus of blessed John of Trogir. Surrounding this are reliefs of genies carrying torches as if peering out of the doors of the underworld. Above them there are niches with sculptures of Christ and the apostles, among of which are putti, circular windows encircled with fruit garland, and a relief of Nativity. All feature a coffered ceiling with an image of God in the middle and 96 portrait of angels' heads.  With so many faces of smiling children, the chapel looks very cheerful, unlike other European art of that time.\n ", "tags": ["1418 births", "1506 deaths", "People from Bagno a Ripoli", "Italian Renaissance sculptors", "15th-century Italian architects", "15th-century Italian sculptors", "Italian male sculptors", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": " The grave of Ser Vittore Cappello in the Church of Saint Helen in Venice, made by Niccol\u00f2 Fiorentino.\nNiccol\u00f2 di Giovanni Fiorentino (Croatian: Nikola Firentinac) called Nicolas of Florence (Bagno a Ripoli, 1418 - \u0160ibenik, 1506), was an Italian Renaissance sculptor and architect, active in Venice and Dalmatia.\nHe is best known by his work on the \u0160ibenik Cathedral of St James, in 1455.
