{"name": "A. Edward Nussbaum", "content": "Adolf Edward Nussbaum (10 January 1925 \u2013  31 October 2009)[1] was a German-born American theoretical mathematician who was a professor of mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis for nearly 40 years. He worked with others in 20th-century theoretical physics and mathematics such as J. Robert Oppenheimer and John von Neumann, and was acquainted with Albert Einstein.\n Nussbaum was born to a Jewish family in Rheydt, a borough of the German city M\u00f6nchengladbach in northwestern Germany, in 1925. The youngest of three children, he was a Holocaust survivor and was orphaned after the Nazi takeover of Germany.[2]\n Both his father, Karl Nussbaum, a wounded veteran of World War I during which he had been awarded the Iron Cross, and his mother, Franziska, died at Auschwitz. His brother, Erwin Nussbaum, was also captured and killed. Nussbaum and his sister, Lieselotte, were separated and sent on a Kindertransport \u00b7to Belgium in 1939.[2]\n When Belgium was invaded by Germany, Nussbaum escaped to southern France, then under the Vichy regime. He lived there at an orphanage known as Ch\u00e2teau de la Hille. He began his teaching career there, while still a teenager, teaching mathematics to the younger children.[2]\n After being captured twice, and jailed once by the Nazis, he escaped on foot to Switzerland, where he attended the University of Zurich,[3] studying both mathematics and physics. In 1947, he was sponsored by relatives in New Jersey to emigrate to the United States.[2]\n Shortly after emigrating to the United States, he studied mathematics at Brooklyn College before transferring to Columbia University in New York where he earned his master of arts degree in 1950 and his Ph.D. in 1957.[3]\n While writing his thesis for Columbia, he worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton with John von Neumann, a mathematician who used Hilbert spaces in his development of the mathematical basis of quantum mechanics. Hilbert spaces eventually became Nussbaum's area of expertise and he wrote several papers with von Neumann on this topic. During this period, Nussbaum also became acquainted with Albert Einstein, another of the original group at the Institute for Advanced Study.[2]\n Nussbaum's thesis was accepted with no revisions and he received his doctorate shortly thereafter.[2]\n In the meantime he had worked at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, where he co-authored papers with Allen Devinatz, and at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. He followed Devinatz to St. Louis to teach at Washington University in 1958.[2]\n In 1962, he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Studies working with Robert Oppenheimer; in 1967\u201368 he was a visiting scholar at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.[2]\n He joined Washington University's mathematics faculty as an assistant professor in 1958. He became a full professor in 1966 and taught until 1995, when he was named an emeritus professor.[3]\n Nussbaum married his cousin's sister-in-law, Anne Ebbin, on September 1, 1957. They had a son, Karl Erich Nussbaum and a daughter, Franziska Suzanne Nussbaum.[2] He died in St. Louis, Missouri, in 2009.\n ", "tags": ["1925 births", "2009 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Mathematical analysts", "Jewish American scientists", "Washington University physicists", "Columbia University alumni", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Washington University in St. Louis faculty", "German emigrants to the United States", "German Jews", "Kindertransport refugees", "American people of German-Jewish descent", "Washington University in St. Louis mathematicians", "People from M\u00f6nchengladbach", "Scientists from St. Louis", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute faculty", "Brooklyn College alumni", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers"], "raw": "German-born American mathematician\nAdolf Edward Nussbaum (10 January 1925 \u2013  31 October 2009)[1] was a German-born American theoretical mathematician who was a professor of mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis for nearly 40 years.
