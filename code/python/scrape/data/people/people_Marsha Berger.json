{"name": "Marsha Berger", "content": "Marsha J. Berger (born 1953) is an American computer scientist. Her areas of research include numerical analysis, computational fluid dynamics, and high-performance parallel computing. She is a Silver Professor of Computer Science and Mathematics in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University.[1]\n Berger received her B.S. in mathematics from State University of New York at Binghamton-Harpur College in 1974. She went on to receive an M.S. and a Ph.D in computer science from Stanford University in 1978 and 1982, respectively.[2]\n Berger's research includes high-performance parallel computing, numerical analysis, and computational fluid dynamics. Specifically she develops software and engineering applications for the spacecraft and aircraft industries. Berger worked at Argonne National Laboratory as a scientific programmer after graduating from SUNY. Her specific duties included developing models for the Energy and Environmental Systems Division. During her time at Stanford, she became associated with the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. After graduating with her Ph.D., she began working at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, first as a postdoc, then as a faculty member. Berger has served as the deputy director of the Courant Institute and still serves as an educator at NYU.[2]\n Berger was the recipient of the Presidential Young Investigator Award, courtesy of the National Science Foundation, in 1988. She received another award from the NSF in 1991, this time a Faculty Award for Women. In 2002, Berger received the NASA Software of the Year Award for Cart3D. In 2000 Berger was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[3] In 2004, she received the IEEE Sidney Fernbach Award.
