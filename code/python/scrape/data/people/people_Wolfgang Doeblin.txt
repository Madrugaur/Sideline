{"name": "Wolfgang Doeblin", "content": "Wolfgang Doeblin, known in France as Vincent Doblin (17 March 1915 \u2013 21 June 1940), was a French-German mathematician.\n A native of Berlin, Wolfgang was the son of the Jewish-German novelist and physician, Alfred D\u00f6blin, and Erna Reiss. His family escaped from Nazi Germany to France where he became a French citizen.  Studying probability theory at the Universit\u00e9 de Paris under Fr\u00e9chet, he quickly made a name for himself as a gifted theorist.  He received his doctorate at age 23.  Drafted in November 1938, after refusing to be exempted from military service, he was a soldier in the French army when World War II broke out in 1939, and was quartered at Givet, in the Ardennes, as a telephone operator.  There, he wrote down his latest work on the Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equation, and sent this as a \"pli cachet\u00e9\" (sealed envelope) to the French Academy of Sciences.  His company, sent to the sector of the Saare on the ligne Maginot in April 1940, was caught in the German attack in the Ardennes in May, withdrew to the Vosges, and capitulated on 22 June 1940. On 21 June, Doeblin shot himself in Housseras (a small village near Epinal), when German troops came within sight. In his last moments, he burned his mathematical notes.\n The sealed envelope was opened in 2000,[1] revealing that Doeblin had obtained major results on the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation and the theory of diffusion processes.[2]\n His life was the subject of a 2007 movie by Agnes Handwerk and Harrie Willems, A Mathematician Rediscovered.[3]\n When he became a French citizen in 1938, he chose the official name of Vincent Doblin. However, he later chose to sign his papers as Wolfgang Doeblin and it is\nunder this name that all his mathematical papers and professional letters were published.\n[4]\n ", "tags": ["1915 births", "1940 suicides", "Alfred D\u00f6blin", "20th-century French mathematicians", "French military personnel who committed suicide", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to France", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Writers from Berlin", "People of the German Empire", "People of the Weimar Republic", "Probability theorists", "French Army soldiers", "French military personnel of World War II", "French military personnel killed in World War II", "Suicides by Jews during the Holocaust", "Suicides by firearm in France", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French-German mathematician\nWolfgang Doeblinca.1938Born(1915-03-17)17 March 1915BerlinDied21 June 1940(1940-06-21) (aged\u00a025)HousserasNationalityFranceAlma\u00a0materUniversit\u00e9 de ParisKnown\u00a0forDoeblin's condition for Markov processes, Doeblin's central limit theoremScientific careerFieldsMathematicsThesisSur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s asymptotiques de mouvements r\u00e9gis par certains types de cha\u00eenes simples\u00a0(1938)Doctoral advisorPaul L\u00e9vyMaurice Ren\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chet\n\nWolfgang Doeblin, known in France as Vincent Doblin (17 March 1915 \u2013 21 June 1940), was a French-German mathematician.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Notes\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nLife[edit]\nA native of Berlin, Wolfgang was the son of the Jewish-German novelist and physician, Alfred D\u00f6blin, and Erna Reiss.
