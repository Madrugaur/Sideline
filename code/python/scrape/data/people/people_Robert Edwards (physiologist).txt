{"name": "Robert Edwards (physiologist)", "content": "\n Sir Robert Geoffrey Edwards CBE FRS MAE[3][4][7] (27 September 1925\u00a0\u2013 10 April 2013) was an English physiologist and pioneer in reproductive medicine, and in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) in particular. Along with the surgeon Patrick Steptoe,[8] and the nurse Jean Purdy, Edwards successfully pioneered conception through IVF, which led to the birth of Louise Brown on 25 July 1978.[9][10][11] They founded the first IVF programme for infertile patients and trained other scientists in their techniques. Edwards was the founding editor-in-chief of Human Reproduction in 1986.[12] In 2010, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for the development of in vitro fertilization\".[13][14][15]\n Edwards was born in Batley, Yorkshire, and attended Manchester Central High School[1] on Whitworth Street in central Manchester, after which he served in the British Army, and then completed his undergraduate studies in biology, graduating with an Ordinary degree at Bangor University.[16][17] He studied at the Institute of Animal Genetics and Embryology at the University of Edinburgh, where he was awarded a PhD in 1955.[5]\n After a year as a postdoctoral research fellow at the California Institute of Technology he joined the scientific staff of the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill. After a further year at the University of Glasgow, in 1963 he moved to the University of Cambridge as Ford Foundation Research Fellow at the Department of Physiology, and a member of Churchill College, Cambridge. He was appointed Reader in physiology in 1969.[18]\n Circa 1960 Edwards started to study human fertilisation, and he continued his work at Cambridge, laying the groundwork for his later success. In 1968 he was able to achieve fertilisation of a human egg in the laboratory and started to collaborate with Patrick Steptoe, a gynaecological surgeon from Oldham. Edwards developed human culture media to allow the fertilisation and early embryo culture, while Steptoe used laparoscopy to recover ovocytes from patients with tubal infertility. Their attempts met significant hostility and opposition,[19] including a refusal of the Medical Research Council to fund their research and a number of lawsuits.[20][21] Roger Gosden was one of his first graduate students.[4]\n The birth of Louise Brown, the world's first 'test-tube baby', at 11:47\u00a0pm on 25 July 1978 at the Oldham General Hospital made medical history: in vitro fertilisation meant a new way to help infertile couples who formerly had no possibility of having a baby.  Nurse Jean Purdy was the first to see Brown's embryo dividing.[22]\n Refinements in technology have increased pregnancy rates and it is estimated that in 2010 about 4 million children have been born by IVF,[13] with approximately 170,000 coming from donated oocyte and embryos.[23][24][25] Their breakthrough laid the groundwork for further innovations such as intracytoplasmatic sperm injection ICSI, embryo biopsy (PGD), and stem cell research.\n Edwards and Steptoe founded the Bourn Hall Clinic as a place to advance their work and train new specialists. Steptoe died in 1988. Edwards continued on in his career as a scientist and an editor of medical journals.\n Edwards received numerous honours and awards including:\n Edwards married Ruth Fowler Edwards (1930\u20132013), also a scientist with significant work, granddaughter of 1908 Nobel laureate physicist Ernest Rutherford and daughter of physicist Ralph Fowler, in 1956.[35] The couple had 5 daughters and 12 grandchildren.[36]\n Edwards died at home near Cambridge, England[36] on 10 April 2013 after a long lung illness.[37] A spokesperson for the University of Cambridge said \"He will be greatly missed by family, friends and colleagues.\"[38] The Guardian reported that, as of Edwards' death, more than four million births had resulted from IVF.[38] Louise Brown said \"His work, along with Patrick Steptoe, has brought happiness and joy to millions of people all over the world by enabling them to have children.\"[39] According to the BBC, his work was motivated by his belief that \"the most important thing in life is having a child.\"[39]\n A plaque was unveiled at the Bourn Hall Clinic in July 2013 by Louise Brown and Alastair MacDonald \u2013 the world's first IVF baby boy \u2013 commemorating Steptoe and Edwards.[40][41]\n ", "tags": ["1925 births", "2013 deaths", "Alumni of Bangor University", "Alumni of the University of Edinburgh", "Commanders of the Order of the British Empire", "English Nobel laureates", "English physiologists", "Fellows of Churchill College, Cambridge", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "British andrologists", "In vitro fertilisation", "Knights Bachelor", "Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine", "People from Batley", "Recipients of the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "Pages containing London Gazette template with parameter supp set to y", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from July 2017", "EngvarB from July 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "English physiologist and pioneer in reproductive medicine and in-vitro fertilisation\nFor other people named Robert Edwards, see Robert Edwards (disambiguation).\n\n\nSir Robert EdwardsFRS CBE MAEBornRobert Geoffrey Edwards(1925-09-27)27 September 1925[1]Batley, EnglandDied10 April 2013(2013-04-10) (aged\u00a087)near Cambridge, EnglandAlma\u00a0mater\nBangor University (BSc)\nUniversity of Edinburgh (PhD)\nKnown\u00a0forPioneering in-vitro fertilisationSpouse(s)Ruth Fowler Edwards[1]Awards\nKnight Bachelor (2011)\nNobel Prize (2010)\nLasker Award (2001)[2][3][4]\nScientific careerFields\nPhysiology\nReproductive medicine\nInstitutions\nUniversity of Cambridge\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nBangor University\nNational Institute for Medical Research\nUniversity of Glasgow\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\nChurchill College, Cambridge\nBourn Hall Clinic\nThesisThe experimental induction of heteroploidy in the mouse\u00a0(1955)Doctoral advisorR.

Nurse Jean Purdy was the first to see Brown's embryo dividing.[22]\n\n Bourn Hall Clinic\nRefinements in technology have increased pregnancy rates and it is estimated that in 2010 about 4 million children have been born by IVF,[13] with approximately 170,000 coming from donated oocyte and embryos.[23][24][25] Their breakthrough laid the groundwork for further innovations such as intracytoplasmatic sperm injection ICSI, embryo biopsy (PGD), and stem cell research.\nEdwards and Steptoe founded the Bourn Hall Clinic as a place to advance their work and train new specialists. Steptoe died in 1988. Edwards continued on in his career as a scientist and an editor of medical journals.\n\nHonours and awards[edit]\nEdwards received numerous honours and awards including:\n\nEdwards was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1984.[3][4]\nIn 1994, Doctor Honoris Causa, University of Valencia (Spain).\nIn 2001, he was awarded the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award by the Lasker Foundation \"for the development of in vitro fertilization, a technological advance that has revolutionized the treatment of human infertility.\"[26]\nIn 2007, he was ranked 26th in The Daily Telegraph's list of 100 greatest living geniuses.[27]\nIn 2007, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Huddersfield.\nOn 4 October 2010, it was announced that Edwards had been awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the development of in-vitro fertilisation.[13] The Nobel Committee praised him for advancing treatment of infertility and noted that babies of IVF have similar health statuses to other babies.[28] G\u00f6ran K. Hansson, secretary of the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, announced the news.[28] The first child of IVF Louise Brown described the award as \"fantastic news\".[29] A Vatican official condemned the move as \"completely out of order\".[29][30] As mentioned by Simon Fishel \"In December 2010, at the Nobel awards ceremony that was full of pathos in Bob's absence, these precious words were spoken, '\u2018In the absence of this year's Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine, I ask Professor Edwards' wife and long-term scientific companion, Dr Ruth Fowler Edwards, to come forward and receive his Prize from the hands of His Majesty the King'\u2019.[31]\u201d\nEdwards was knighted in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to human reproductive biology.[32][33]\nEdwards featured in the BBC Radio 4 series The New Elizabethans to mark the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 2012. A panel of 7 academics, journalists and historians named him among the group of people in the UK \"whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands and given the age its character\".[34]\nPersonal life[edit]\nEdwards married Ruth Fowler Edwards (1930\u20132013), also a scientist with significant work, granddaughter of 1908 Nobel laureate physicist Ernest Rutherford and daughter of physicist Ralph Fowler, in 1956.[35] The couple had 5 daughters and 12 grandchildren.[36]\n\nDeath[edit]\nEdwards died at home near Cambridge, England[36] on 10 April 2013 after a long lung illness.[37] A spokesperson for the University of Cambridge said \"He will be greatly missed by family, friends and colleagues.\"[38] The Guardian reported that, as of Edwards' death, more than four million births had resulted from IVF.[38] Louise Brown said \"His work, along with Patrick Steptoe, has brought happiness and joy to millions of people all over the world by enabling them to have children.\"[39] According to the BBC, his work was motivated by his belief that \"the most important thing in life is having a child.\"[39]\nA plaque was unveiled at the Bourn Hall Clinic in July 2013 by Louise Brown and Alastair MacDonald \u2013 the world's first IVF baby boy \u2013 commemorating Steptoe and Edwards.[40][41]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"EDWARDS, Sir Robert (Geoffrey)\".
