She took her M.A. in 1930.[1]\n Grimshaw was Assistant Lecturer in Mathematics from 1928 to 1930 and Associates Resident Fellow 1930\u20131933.

An Introduction to the Theory of Hilbert Space.[3] She published in mathematics journals.\n Grimshaw was on the Council of Newnham College from 1936 to 1968.
