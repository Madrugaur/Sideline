{"name": "Asher Benjamin", "content": "Asher Benjamin (June 15, 1773\u00a0\u2013 July 26, 1845) was an American architect and author whose work transitioned between Federal architecture and the later Greek Revival architecture. His seven handbooks on design deeply influenced the look of cities and towns throughout New England until the Civil War. Builders also copied his plans in the Midwest and in the South.\n Asher Benjamin was born in rural Hartland, Connecticut,[1] shortly after which his father died. The first 30 years of his life would be spent in the Connecticut River Valley. He received his early training from a local builder, and showed an aptitude for architecture by carving Ionic capitals for the 1794 modifications to the Oliver Phelps House at Suffield, Connecticut. In 1795-1796 he designed and built a stone spiral staircase in the Old State House at Hartford, which had been designed by Charles Bulfinch. The latter's use of overall symmetry, blind arches, fanlights and smooth brick greatly influenced Benjamin, who would help spread the urbane Federal style into the countryside. Gideon Granger would write of Benjamin that:\n He first settled in Greenfield, Massachusetts, where he built two large houses, including the Leavitt House (today's Leavitt-Hovey House) for Judge Jonathan Leavitt, as well as publishing his first handbook, The Country Builder's Assistant (1797). On November 30, 1797, he married Achsah Hitchcock of Brookfield, who bore him four children. Benjamin later moved to Windsor, Vermont, where he built three large houses and the Old South Congregational Church (1798).\n By 1803, he was in Boston. Listed in the city directory as a housewright, he designed numerous churches and houses. He also appears to have conducted the country's first architecture school, credited with teaching Robert Henry Eddy, Elias Carter, Solomon Willard, Samuel Shepherd and Ithiel Town. After his first wife died on January 30, 1805, on July 24 he married Nancy Bryant of Springfield, who bore him another four children. \n In 1823 and 1824, Benjamin was elected alderman of Boston as part of the \"Middling Interest,\" a coalition of middle class entrepreneurs and artisans opposed to the Federalists, and who supported Josiah Quincy for mayor. He would help Mayor Quincy and Alexander Parris plan Quincy Market. But his political ambitions were curtailed by financial problems, which led to bankruptcy in 1825. From 1825 to 1827 he left Boston to supervise construction of locks, canals, roads and mill buildings for the Nashua Manufacturing Company in Nashua, New Hampshire. He also designed two churches there before returning to Boston.[3]\n Benjamin's greatest influence, however, is due to his pattern books. They were the first written by an American architect, bringing architectural history, style and geometry to ordinary builders in the field. He adapted many designs by James Gibbs and Colen Campbell of Great Britain to fit the scale and finances of New England communities. These handbooks provided superb drawings and practical advice for full house plans, including such details as circular staircases, doorways, fireplace mantels, dormer windows, pilasters, balusters and fences. He sketched proposals for dwellings and churches, even a courthouse. The archeological sources of his designs were scrupulously cited, from the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens to the Arch of Titus in Rome. Other architects, including Ithiel Town and Ammi B. Young, freely assimilated his plans, as did innumerable carpenters. Indeed, the charm of many early New England towns owes a debt to Asher Benjamin. The Ridge in Orford, New Hampshire features a series of houses based on designs from his books, many of which remain in print.[4] And although he helped disseminate the Federal style, he was not averse to changing fashion. In fact, his book published in 1830, The Architect, or, Practical House Carpenter, helped redirect American taste towards the Greek Revival.\n But as architectural historian Talbot Hamlin writes:\n Asher Benjamin died in Springfield at the age of 72.\n Coleman-Hollister House, 1796, Greenfield, Massachusetts\n Interior, Coleman-Hollister House, 1796, Greenfield, Massachusetts\n First Deerfield Academy building, later Memorial Hall, 1797\u20131798, Deerfield, Massachusetts\n Old South Congregational Church, 1798, Windsor, Vermont\n Charles Street Meeting House, 1804, Boston\n Old West Church, 1806, Boston\n First Parish Church, 1809, Ashby, Massachusetts\n Center Church on the Green, 1812\u20131814, New Haven, Connecticut\n Unitarian Church, 1825, Peterborough, New Hampshire\n Unitarian Church, 1827, Nashua, New Hampshire\n 70-75 Beacon Street, 1828, Boston\n Asa Waters Mansion, Millbury, Massachusetts\n ", "tags": ["1773 births", "1845 deaths", "People from Hartland, Connecticut", "People from Greenfield, Massachusetts", "Architects from Boston", "People of colonial Connecticut", "Greek Revival architects", "Federalist architects", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Asher BenjaminBorn(1773-06-15)June 15, 1773Hartland, ConnecticutDiedJuly 26, 1845(1845-07-26) (aged\u00a072)Springfield, MassachusettsNationalityAmericanOccupationArchitectBuildingsLeavitt-Hovey HouseCharles Street Meeting HouseOld West Church, BostonAfrican Meeting HouseHeadquarters HouseCharles PlayhouseProjectsWrote seven pattern books to help elevate American architectural taste\n\nAsher Benjamin (June 15, 1773\u00a0\u2013 July 26, 1845) was an American architect and author whose work transitioned between Federal architecture and the later Greek Revival architecture.
