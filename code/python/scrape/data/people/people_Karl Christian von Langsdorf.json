{"name": "Karl Christian von Langsdorf", "content": "Karl Christian von Langsdorf, also known as Carl Christian von Langsdorff (18 May 1757 in Nauheim[1] \u2013 10 June 1834 in Heidelberg), was a German mathematician, geologist, natural scientist and engineer.\n Langsdorf was the son of Georg Melchior Langsdorff and Maria Margarethe Koch. His father was saltworks archivist and Hesse-Hanau Rentmeister (master of the bursary) (saltworks of Nauheim). He had a twin brother named Daniel Isaak. After finishing Gymnasium (secondary school) in Idstein in 1773, Langsdorf studied, among other things, philosophy, law, and mathematics at University of G\u00f6ttingen from 1774 until autumn of 1776 with Abraham Gotthelf K\u00e4stner and then until 1777 at the University of Giessen. He then interned at the saltworks in Salzhausen, and subsequently devoted himself in Nidda, Hesse to the study of saltworks. He finished his doctorate in 1781 in Erfurt.\n In the summer semester of 1781, he was an outside lecturer at Giessen. For health reasons however, he decided against an academic career. He pursued a career in administration and became Rentmeister and land judge in M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr. Starting in 1784, he was active as a saltworks inspector in Gerabronn (near Rothenburg ob der Tauber), which belonged to the margravate of Ansbach at the time.\n In 1798, he was given a full professorship in mechanical engineering at Erlangen. He taught there until 1804 and he subjected the 15-year-old Georg Ohm to a thorough examination of his knowledge of mathematics. Ohm and his younger brother were instructed in mathematics by their father.\n He refused an offer from Heidelberg in 1803 and accepted an offer to teach mathematics and technology at Vilnius University. In Russia, he and his family were elevated into the hereditary aristocracy.[2] In 1806, he returned with the aristocratic descriptor von and became (with the help of his older brother Gottlieb, the governor of Dilsburg) full professor in Heidelberg.\n The mathematical physics class of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences admitted him to its ranks as a non-local member in 1808. Langsdorf left the University of Erlangen in early 1809 to take up a post in the University of Heidelberg.\nKarl Christian von Langsdorff had been a professor of mathematics at Heidelberg from 1806 to 1834.(He is relative with mathematician Christian Hugo Eduard Study)\nLangsdorf was also very interested in theological questions and published several works on this topic.\nHis brother, Johann Wilhelm, made a name for himself as a specialist in the area of saltworks engineering.\n In German\n In German\n ", "tags": ["1757 births", "1834 deaths", "People from Bad Nauheim", "18th-century German mathematicians", "Engineers from Hesse", "18th-century German engineers", "People from the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "University of Giessen alumni", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg faculty", "Heidelberg University faculty", "Vilnius University faculty", "19th-century German mathematicians", "19th-century German engineers", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "German scientist and engineer\n Karl Christian von Langsdorf\nKarl Christian von Langsdorf, also known as Carl Christian von Langsdorff (18 May 1757 in Nauheim[1] \u2013 10 June 1834 in Heidelberg), was a German mathematician, geologist, natural scientist and engineer.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 References\n3 Students\n4 Selected works\n5 Literature\n6 External links\n\n\nLife[edit]\nLangsdorf was the son of Georg Melchior Langsdorff and Maria Margarethe Koch.
