{"name": "Douglas Hofstadter", "content": "\n Douglas Richard Hofstadter (born February 15, 1945) is an American scholar of cognitive science, physics, and comparative literature whose research includes concepts such as the sense of self in relation to the external world,[1][4] consciousness, analogy-making, artistic creation, literary translation, and discovery in mathematics and physics. His 1979 book G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid won both the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction[5][6] and a National Book Award (at that time called The American Book Award) for Science.[7][note 1] His 2007 book I Am a Strange Loop won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Science and Technology.[8][9][10]\n Hofstadter was born in New York City to Jewish parents: Nobel Prize-winning physicist Robert Hofstadter and Nancy Givan Hofstadter.[11] He grew up on the campus of Stanford University, where his father was a professor, and attended the International School of Geneva in 1958\u201359. He graduated with Distinction in mathematics from Stanford University in 1965, and received his Ph.D. in physics[3][12] from the University of Oregon in 1975, where his study of the energy levels of Bloch electrons in a magnetic field led to his discovery of the fractal known as Hofstadter's butterfly.[12]\n Since 1988, Hofstadter has been the College of Arts and Sciences Distinguished Professor of Cognitive Science and Comparative Literature at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he directs the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition which consists of himself and his graduate students, forming the \"Fluid Analogies Research Group\" (FARG).[13] He was initially appointed to the Indiana University's Computer Science Department faculty in 1977, and at that time he launched his research program in computer modeling of mental processes (which he called \"artificial intelligence research\", a label he has since dropped in favor of \"cognitive science research\"). In 1984, he moved to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he was hired as a professor of psychology and was also appointed to the Walgreen Chair for the Study of Human Understanding. In 1988 he returned to Bloomington as \"College of Arts and Sciences Professor\" in both cognitive science and computer science. He was also appointed adjunct professor of history and philosophy of science, philosophy, comparative literature, and psychology, but has said that his involvement with most of those departments is nominal.[14][15][16] In 1988 Hofstadter received the In Praise of Reason award, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry's highest honor.[17] In April 2009 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences[18] and a member of the American Philosophical Society.[19] In 2010 he was elected a member of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, Sweden.[20]\n Hofstadter's many interests include music, visual art, the mind, creativity, consciousness, self-reference, translation and mathematics.\n At the University of Michigan and Indiana University, he and Melanie Mitchell coauthored a computational model of \"high-level perception\"\u2014Copycat\u2014and several other models of analogy-making and cognition, including the Tabletop project, co-developed with Robert M. French. Hofstadter's doctoral student James Marshall subsequently extended the Copycat project under the name \"Metacat\".[21] The Letter Spirit project, implemented by Gary McGraw and John Rehling, aims to model artistic creativity by designing stylistically uniform \"gridfonts\" (typefaces limited to a grid). Other more recent models include Phaeaco (implemented by Harry Foundalis) and SeqSee (Abhijit Mahabal), which model high-level perception and analogy-making in the microdomains of Bongard problems and number sequences, respectively, as well as George (Francisco Lara-Dammer), which models the processes of perception and discovery in triangle geometry.[22][23][24]\n The pursuit of beauty has driven Hofstadter both inside and outside his professional work. He seeks beautiful mathematical patterns, beautiful explanations, beautiful typefaces, beautiful sonic patterns in poetry, etc. Hofstadter has said of himself, \"I'm someone who has one foot in the world of humanities and arts, and the other foot in the world of science.\" He has had several exhibitions of his artwork in various university galleries. These shows have featured large collections of his gridfonts, his ambigrams (pieces of calligraphy created with two readings, either of which is usually obtained from the other by rotating or reflecting the ambigram, but sometimes simply by \"oscillation\", like the Necker Cube or the rabbit/duck figure of Joseph Jastrow), and his \"Whirly Art\" (music-inspired visual patterns realized using shapes based on various alphabets from India). Hofstadter invented the term \"ambigram\" in 1984; many ambigrammists have since taken up the concept.[25]\n Hofstadter collects and studies cognitive errors (largely, but not solely, speech errors), \"bon mots\" (spontaneous humorous quips), and analogies of all sorts, and his longtime observation of these diverse products of cognition, and his theories about the mechanisms that underlie them, have exerted a powerful influence on the architectures of the computational models he and FARG members have developed.[26]\n All FARG computational models share certain key principles, including:\n FARG models also have an overarching philosophy that all cognition is built from the making of analogies. The computational architectures that share these precepts are called \"active symbols\" architectures.\n Hofstadter's thesis about consciousness, first expressed in G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach (GEB) but also present in several of his later books, is that it is an emergent consequence of seething lower-level activity in the brain. In GEB he draws an analogy between the social organization of a colony of ants and the mind seen as a coherent \"colony\" of neurons. In particular, Hofstadter claims that our sense of having (or being) an \"I\" comes from the abstract pattern he terms a \"strange loop\", an abstract cousin of such concrete phenomena as audio and video feedback that Hofstadter has defined as \"a level-crossing feedback loop\". The prototypical example of a strange loop is the self-referential structure at the core of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems. Hofstadter's 2007 book I Am a Strange Loop carries his vision of consciousness considerably further, including the idea that each human \"I\" is distributed over numerous brains, rather than being limited to one.[27]\n Hofstadter's writing is characterized by an intense interaction between form and content, as exemplified by the 20 dialogues in GEB, many of which simultaneously discuss and imitate strict musical forms used by Bach, such as canons and fugues. Most of Hofstadter's books feature some kind of structural alternation: in GEB between dialogues and chapters, in The Mind's I between selections and reflections, in Metamagical Themas between Chapters and Postscripts, and so forth. In both his writing and his teaching, Hofstadter stresses the concrete, constantly using examples and analogies, and avoids the abstract. Typical of the courses he teaches is his seminar \"Group Theory and Galois Theory Visualized\", in which abstract mathematical ideas are rendered as concretely as possible. He puts great effort into making ideas clear and visual, and asserts that when he teaches, if his students do not understand something, it is never their fault but always his own.\n Hofstadter is passionate about languages. In addition to English, his mother tongue, he speaks French and Italian fluently (the language spoken at home with his children is Italian). At various times in his life, he has studied (in descending order of level of fluency reached) German, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Mandarin, Dutch, Polish, and Hindi.[citation needed] His love of sounds pushes him to strive to minimize, and ideally get rid of, any foreign accent.\n Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language is a long book devoted to language and translation, especially poetry translation, and one of its leitmotifs is a set of 88 translations of \"Ma Mignonne\", a highly constrained poem by 16th-century French poet Cl\u00e9ment Marot. In this book, Hofstadter jokingly describes himself as \"pilingual\" (meaning that the sum total of the varying degrees of mastery of all the languages that he has studied comes to 3.14159\u00a0...), as well as an \"oligoglot\" (someone who speaks \"a few\" languages).[28][29]\n In 1999, the bicentennial year of the Russian poet and writer Alexander Pushkin, Hofstadter published a verse translation of Pushkin's classic novel-in-verse Eugene Onegin. He has translated many other poems, too (always respecting their formal constraints) and two novels (in prose): La Chamade (That Mad Ache) by French writer Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, and La Scoperta dell'Alba (The Discovery of Dawn) by Walter Veltroni, the then-head of the Partito Democratico in Italy. The Discovery of Dawn was published in 2007, and That Mad Ache was published in 2009, bound together with Hofstadter's essay Translator, Trader: An Essay on the Pleasantly Pervasive Paradoxes of Translation.\n Hofstadter's Law is \"It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.\" The law is stated in GEB.\n Hofstadter's former Ph.D. students[30] include (with dissertation title):\n Hofstadter has said that he feels \"uncomfortable with the nerd culture that centers on computers\". He admits that \"a large fraction [of his audience] seems to be those who are fascinated by technology\", but when it was suggested that his work \"has inspired many students to begin careers in computing and artificial intelligence\" he replied that he was pleased about that, but that he himself has \"no interest in computers\".[32][33] In that interview he also mentioned a course he has twice given at Indiana University, in which he took a \"skeptical look at a number of highly touted AI projects and overall approaches\".[16] For example, upon the defeat of Garry Kasparov by Deep Blue, he commented that \"It was a watershed event, but it doesn't have to do with computers becoming intelligent\".[34] Hofstadter's disinterest in computers is analogous to an astronomer's disinterest in telescopes. In his book Metamagical Themas, he says that \"in this day and age, how can anyone fascinated by creativity and beauty fail to see in computers the ultimate tool for exploring their essence?\".[35]\n Provoked by predictions of a technological singularity (a hypothetical moment in the future of humanity when a self-reinforcing, runaway development of artificial intelligence causes a radical change in technology and culture), Hofstadter has both organized and participated in several public discussions of the topic. At Indiana University in 1999 he organized such a symposium, and in April 2000, he organized a larger symposium titled \"Spiritual Robots\" at Stanford University, in which he moderated a panel consisting of Ray Kurzweil, Hans Moravec, Kevin Kelly, Ralph Merkle, Bill Joy, Frank Drake, John Holland and John Koza. Hofstadter was also an invited panelist at the first Singularity Summit, held at Stanford in May 2006. Hofstadter expressed doubt that the singularity will occur in the foreseeable future.[36][37][38][39][40][41]\n In 1988 Dutch director Piet Hoenderdos created a docudrama about Hofstadter and his ideas, Victim of the Brain, based on The Mind's I. It includes interviews with Hofstadter about his work.[42]\n When Martin Gardner retired from writing his \"Mathematical Games\" column for Scientific American magazine, Hofstadter succeeded him in 1981\u201383 with a column titled Metamagical Themas (an anagram of \"Mathematical Games\"). An idea he introduced in one of these columns was the concept of \"Reviews of This Book\", a book containing nothing but cross-referenced reviews of itself that has an online implementation.[43] One of Hofstadter's columns in Scientific American concerned the damaging effects of sexist language, and two chapters of his book Metamagical Themas are devoted to that topic, one of which is a biting analogy-based satire, \"A Person Paper on Purity in Language\" (1985), in which the reader's presumed revulsion at racism and racist language is used as a lever to motivate an analogous revulsion at sexism and sexist language; Hofstadter published it under the pseudonym William Satire, an allusion to William Safire.[44] Another column reported on the discoveries made by University of Michigan professor Robert Axelrod in his computer tournament pitting many iterated prisoner's dilemma strategies against each other, and a follow-up column discussed a similar tournament that Hofstadter and his graduate student Marek Lugowski organized.[citation needed] The \"Metamagical Themas\" columns ranged over many themes, including patterns in Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin's piano music (particularly his \u00e9tudes), the concept of superrationality (choosing to cooperate when the other party/adversary is assumed to be equally intelligent as oneself), and the self-modifying game of Nomic, based on the way in which the legal system modifies itself, and developed by philosopher Peter Suber.[45]\n Hofstadter was married to Carol Ann Brush until her death. They met in Bloomington, and married in Ann Arbor in 1985. They had two children, Danny and Monica. Carol died in 1993 from the sudden onset of a brain tumor \u2014 glioblastoma multiforme \u2014 when their children were 5 and 2. The Carol Ann Brush Hofstadter Memorial Scholarship for Bologna-bound Indiana University students was established in 1996 in her name.[46] Hofstadter's book Le Ton beau de Marot is dedicated to their two children and its dedication reads \"To M. & D., living sparks of their Mommy's soul\".\n In the fall of 2010, Hofstadter met Baofen Lin in a cha-cha-cha class, and they married in Bloomington in September 2012.[47]\n Hofstadter has composed numerous pieces for piano and a few for piano and voice. He created an audio CD, DRH/JJ, which includes all these compositions performed mostly by pianist Jane Jackson, with a few performed by Brian Jones, Dafna Barenboim, Gitanjali Mathur and Hofstadter.[48]\n The dedication for I Am A Strange Loop is: \"To my sister Laura, who can understand, and to our sister Molly, who cannot.\"[49] Hofstadter explains in the preface that his younger sister Molly never developed the ability to speak or understand language.[50]\n As a consequence of his attitudes about consciousness and empathy, Hofstadter has been a vegan for roughly half his life.[51]\n In the 1982 novel 2010: Odyssey Two, Arthur C. Clarke's first sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 is described by Dr. Chandra as being caught in a \"Hofstadter\u2013M\u00f6bius loop\". The movie uses the term \"H. M\u00f6bius loop\".\n On April 3, 1995, Hofstadter's book Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought was the first book ever sold by Amazon.com.[52]\n The books published by Hofstadter are (the ISBNs refer to paperback editions, where available):\n Hofstadter has written, among many others, the following papers:\n Hofstadter has also written over 50 papers that were published through the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition.[53]\n Hofstadter has written forewords for or edited the following books:\n ", "tags": ["1945 births", "Living people", "20th-century American writers", "20th-century American philosophers", "21st-century American poets", "21st-century philosophers", "21st-century translators", "American people of Polish-Jewish descent", "American science writers", "Mathematics popularizers", "American skeptics", "Cognitive scientists", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Indiana University faculty", "National Book Award winners", "Palo Alto High School alumni", "People from Palo Alto, California", "Philosophers of mind", "Jewish philosophers", "Jewish American writers", "Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction winners", "Recreational mathematicians", "Stanford University alumni", "Translators of Alexander Pushkin", "University of Michigan faculty", "University of Oregon alumni", "Fellows of the Cognitive Science Society", "Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences fellows", "21st-century American non-fiction writers", "International School of Geneva alumni", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "Webarchive template other archives", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from October 2018", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from June 2010", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2014", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American professor of cognitive science\n\n\nDouglas HofstadterHofstadter in Bologna, Italy, in 2002BornDouglas Richard Hofstadter (1945-02-15) February 15, 1945 (age\u00a076)New York City, United StatesNationalityAmericanEducationStanford University (BSc)University of Oregon (PhD, 1974)Known\u00a0forG\u00f6del, Escher, BachI Am a Strange Loop[1]Hofstadter's butterflyHofstadter's lawSpouse(s)Carol Ann Brush (1985\u20131993; her death; 2 children)Baofen Lin (2012\u2013present)AwardsNational Book AwardPulitzer PrizeMember of the American Academy of Arts and SciencesGolden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement[2]Scientific careerFieldsCognitive sciencePhilosophy of mindTranslationPhysicsInstitutionsIndiana University Stanford University University of Oregon University of MichiganThesisThe Energy Levels of Bloch Electrons in a Magnetic Field\u00a0(1974)Doctoral advisorGregory Wannier[3]Doctoral studentsDavid ChalmersRobert M.

Carol died in 1993 from the sudden onset of a brain tumor \u2014 glioblastoma multiforme \u2014 when their children were 5 and 2. The Carol Ann Brush Hofstadter Memorial Scholarship for Bologna-bound Indiana University students was established in 1996 in her name.[46] Hofstadter's book Le Ton beau de Marot is dedicated to their two children and its dedication reads \"To M. & D., living sparks of their Mommy's soul\".\nIn the fall of 2010, Hofstadter met Baofen Lin in a cha-cha-cha class, and they married in Bloomington in September 2012.[47]\nHofstadter has composed numerous pieces for piano and a few for piano and voice. He created an audio CD, DRH/JJ, which includes all these compositions performed mostly by pianist Jane Jackson, with a few performed by Brian Jones, Dafna Barenboim, Gitanjali Mathur and Hofstadter.[48]\nThe dedication for I Am A Strange Loop is: \"To my sister Laura, who can understand, and to our sister Molly, who cannot.\"[49] Hofstadter explains in the preface that his younger sister Molly never developed the ability to speak or understand language.[50]\nAs a consequence of his attitudes about consciousness and empathy, Hofstadter has been a vegan for roughly half his life.[51]\n\nIn popular culture[edit]\nIn the 1982 novel 2010: Odyssey Two, Arthur C. Clarke's first sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 is described by Dr. Chandra as being caught in a \"Hofstadter\u2013M\u00f6bius loop\". The movie uses the term \"H. M\u00f6bius loop\".\nOn April 3, 1995, Hofstadter's book Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought was the first book ever sold by Amazon.com.[52]\n\nPublished works[edit]\nBooks[edit]\nThe books published by Hofstadter are (the ISBNs refer to paperback editions, where available):\n\nG\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid (ISBN\u00a00-465-02656-7) (1979)\nMetamagical Themas (ISBN\u00a00-465-04566-9) (collection of Scientific American columns and other essays, all with postscripts)\nAmbigrammi: un microcosmo ideale per lo studio della creativit\u00e0 (ISBN\u00a088-7757-006-7) (in Italian only)\nFluid Concepts and Creative Analogies (co-authored with several of Hofstadter's graduate students) (ISBN\u00a00-465-02475-0)\nRhapsody on a Theme by Clement Marot (ISBN\u00a00-910153-11-6) (1995, published 1996; volume 16 of series The Grace A.
