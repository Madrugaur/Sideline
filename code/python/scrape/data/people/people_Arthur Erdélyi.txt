{"name": "Arthur Erd\u00e9lyi", "content": "\n Arthur Erd\u00e9lyi FRS,[1] FRSE (2 October 1908 \u2013 12 December 1977) was a Hungarian-born British mathematician. Erd\u00e9lyi was a leading expert on special functions, particularly orthogonal polynomials and hypergeometric functions.[2][3]\n He was born Arthur Diamant in Budapest, Hungary to Ign\u00e1c Josef Armin Diamant and Frederike Roth. His name was changed to Erd\u00e9lyi when his mother remarried to Paul Erd\u00e9lyi. He attended the primary and secondary schools there from 1914 to 1926. His interest in mathematics dates back to this time. Erd\u00e9lyi was a Jew, and so it was difficult for him to receive a university education in his native Hungary. He travelled to Brno, Czechoslovakia, to obtain a degree in electrical engineering. However, after his flair for mathematics was discovered (he won several prizes in a competition in his first year), he was persuaded to study the subject.\n He soon after began to conduct theoretical research into mathematics, and his first paper was published in 1930. At the end of 1936, he had already published 18 papers, and 11 more appeared in 1937. However, due to the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and neighbouring countries, Erd\u00e9lyi was forced to flee the country.\n Erd\u00e9lyi contacted Edmund Whittaker, a fellow expert in hypergeometric functions, asking for his assistance and soon after, Erd\u00e9lyi travelled to Edinburgh, Scotland, after receiving \u00a3400 for a visa from Whittaker. He joined the University of Edinburgh, and after 2 years there, became a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics (after gaining a DSc in 1940 based on his already extensive published work).[4]\n In 1946, after Harry Bateman died, Whittaker was asked to recommend a mathematician who could start the task of publishing Bateman's manuscripts: the Bateman Manuscript Project. Erd\u00e9lyi was chosen, and in 1947, after becoming a naturalised British citizen, travelled to Caltech, California as a Visiting Professor. He returned to Edinburgh in 1948, only to resign in 1949 to assume the position of Professor of Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology. This was a post he was to hold for the next 15 years, and he retained his citizenship of Britain while in the United States.\n In 1964, he returned to Edinburgh as a Professor of Mathematics, a position he held until his death in 1977.\n He died in Edinburgh.[5]\n He married Eva Neuburg in 1942. They did not have children.\n Erd\u00e9lyi was primarily an expert in special functions, in particular, Lam\u00e9 functions, hypergeometric functions and orthogonal polynomials. He also contributed to the field of asymptotic analysis, fractional integration and partial differential equations. He introduced the Erd\u00e9lyi\u2013Kober operators for fractional integration. He wrote two books of high standing - Asymptotic Expansions (1955) (reprinted by Dover) and Operational Calculus and Generalised Functions (1962)\n Erd\u00e9lyi received several honours, including being elected to the Royal Society as a Fellow in 1975.[1] He also became a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1945, and was also elected a member of the Academy of Sciences of Turin.\n ", "tags": ["1908 births", "1977 deaths", "Mathematicians from Budapest", "Hungarian Jews", "Jews who immigrated to the United Kingdom to escape Nazism", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh", "California Institute of Technology faculty", "Academics of the University of Edinburgh", "20th-century British mathematicians", "Hungarian refugees", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "Articles needing additional references from November 2016", "All articles needing additional references", "Use dmy dates from April 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.
