{"name": "Anup Kumar (actor)", "content": "\n Anup Kumar (17 June 1930 \u2013 3 September 1998[1]) was an Indian actor who is known for his work in Bengali cinema. He is survived by his wife Aloka Ganguli.\n Anup Kumar was born on 17 June 1930 in Kolkata, British-occupied India. His real name was Satyen Das. His parents were Dhirendra Nath Das who was a singer and actor and was closely associated with the famous poet and composer, Kazi Nazrul Islam [1899-1976], and Bijoya Das.  He passed his Matriculation at the Calcutta Jubilee Institution. In 1986, he married actress Aloka Ganguly.\n Anup Kumar took his acting lessons from his father and Sisir Kumar Bhaduri. He started acting quite early in life. He got his first break as a child artist in Dhiren Ganguly's film Halkatha (1938). Nimantran and Palatak were the movies which exposed his versatility as an actor. He was also involved with live theatre, yatras, and film directing.\n In 1964, he was awarded the BFJA Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film Palatak. He received a silver medal from the Star Theatre. In 1988, he won the West Bengal Natya Academy Award. In 1989, he was awarded with Siromoni Prize and in 1991, he was awarded Best Director for his yatras. In 1997, he was recognized by the BFJA Awards for completion of 50 years in films.\n Besides his superlative performance in Palatak, Anup Kumar is also remembered for his brilliant comic timing. Along with the classic comedians like Nabadwip Haldar, Bhanu Bandopadhyay, Jahor Roy and Rabi Ghosh, Anup Kumar is much-admired comedic roles in films such as 'Basanto Bilap', 'Mouchak', 'Dadar Kirti', 'Protisodh'. After the death of Rabi Ghosh, it was Anup Kumar who was cast as Jatayu, the famous friend of Satyajit Ray's detective Feluda.\n In 1996, Kumar stood for election to the Vidhan Sabha as a CPI(M) representative from Cossipore; but he was not elected.[citation needed]\n ", "tags": ["1932 births", "Bengali Hindus", "Male actors in Bengali cinema", "Bengali male actors", "Indian male film actors", "Indian male comedians", "1998 deaths", "20th-century Indian male actors", "Bengali people", "Male actors from Kolkata", "20th-century comedians", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from September 2019", "Articles needing additional references from January 2010", "All articles needing additional references", "Use dmy dates from January 2021", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from May 2016", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Not to be confused with Anoop Kumar or Anoop Kumar (Tamil actor).\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
