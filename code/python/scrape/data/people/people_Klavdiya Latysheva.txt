She was honoured with the Order of Lenin and the Medal \"For Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War 1941\u20131945\".\n Klavdiya Yakovlevna Latysheva was born in Kiev on 14 March 1897[1] in a military family. She completed her high school in 1916, and obtained a degree from the Physico-Mathematical division of the Kiev higher women's educational institution in 1921. The rest of her education and career was at the University of Kiev. From 1925 to 1928, she was in postgraduate studies, working on finding solutions to differential and integral equations using Mikhail Kravchuk's method of moments. Kravchuk was her doctoral adviser.[2] She was the first Ukrainian woman to obtain a doctorate in the mathematical and physical sciences, with her dissertation on approximate solutions to linear differential equations with singular coefficients (1936).[3]\n Latysheva was an organiser of the first All-Ukrainian Mathematical Olympiad in 1936.\n During the Second World War, Latysheva transferred to Saratov.[3] She worked at the automotive and highway faculty of the Saratov State Technical University.[4]\n In 1946, she established a scientific group in the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of University of Kiev to study the analytical theory of differential equations. Between 1953 and 1956, Latysheva headed this group. She was the dean of the Faculty between 1952 and 1954.[5]\n For her contributions to mathematics, she was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1954,[6] as well as the Medal \"For Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War 1941\u20131945\".\n Latysheva died on 11 May 1956,[3] and was interred in the Lukyanovsk cemetery in Kiev.\n Latysheva developed an effective method for the construction of solutions of linear ordinary differential equations around regular and irregular points by expanding on Poincar\u00e9's concept of rank and L. Tome's concept of anti-rank. This is now known as the Frobenius-Latysheva method. As part of this work, she determined a new type of normal and normal-regular solutions, and provided necessary and sufficient conditions for their existence.[7] This was a major contribution, providing for the existence of closed-form solutions of linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients.[3] A series of twelve articles, published between 1946\u20131952, established the full results, and also simplified and extended related theorems in the analytic theory of differential equations by Poincar\u00e9, Cayley and others.[6]\n ", "tags": ["Soviet mathematicians", "Soviet women mathematicians", "Ukrainian mathematicians", "Women mathematicians", "Scientists from Kyiv", "1897 births", "1956 deaths", "Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv alumni", "Recipients of the Order of Lenin", "Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv faculty", "Burials at Lukianivka Cemetery", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Ukrainian-language text", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "CS1 Russian-language sources (ru)", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "Soviet mathematician\nIn this Eastern Slavic name, the patronymic is  Yakovlevna and the family name is  Latysheva.\nKlavdiya LatyshevaBorn(1897-03-14)March 14, 1897DiedMay 11, 1956(1956-05-11) (aged\u00a059)Resting placeLukyanivka cemetery, KievNationalityUkrainianCitizenshipSovietAlma\u00a0materUniversity of KievKnown\u00a0forFrobenius-Latysheva methodScientific careerFieldsDifferential equationsThesis\u041d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0432'\u044f\u0437\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e\u044e \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0456\u0432 \u043b\u0456\u043d\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0445, \u0434\u0438\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0456\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0456\u0432\u043d\u044f\u043d\u044c, \u0449\u043e \u043c\u0430\u044e\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0435\u0444\u0456\u0446\u0456\u0454\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0445\u00a0(1936)Doctoral advisorMikhail Kravchuk\n\nKlavdiya Yakovlevna Latysheva (Ukrainian: \u041a\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0456\u044f \u042f\u043a\u0456\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0430; Russian: \u041a\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0438\u044f \u042f\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041b\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0430; born 14 March 1897, Kiev, Russian Empire \u2013 11 May 1956, Kiev, Soviet Union) was a Soviet mathematician known for her contributions to the theory of differential equations, electrodynamics and probability.
