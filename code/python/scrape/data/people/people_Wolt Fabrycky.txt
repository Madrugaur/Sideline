In 1962 Fabrycky received his PhD in Engineering from Oklahoma State University where he was awarded an Ethyl Corporation Doctoral Fellowship.[1]\n Fabrycky began as a faculty member at the University of Arkansas in 1957 and continued at Oklahoma State University during 1962-65. In September 1965 he was appointed to the Industrial Engineering faculty at Virginia Tech, where he served for 30 years.[2] There in 1968, he founded and chaired the Interdisciplinary Systems Engineering Graduate Program, served as Associate Dean of Engineering, and later became Virginia Tech's Dean of Research.[1]\n Over a half-century, Wolt Fabrycky received numerous engineering and systems engineering awards. He was elected Fellow in the Institute of Industrial Engineers in 1978; Fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1980; Fellow in the International Council on Systems Engineering in 1999; and Fellow in the American Society for Engineering Education in 2007. Fabrycky received the Hotlzman Distinguished Educator Award from the Institute of Industrial Engineers in 1990; the Lohmann Medal from the College of Engineering at Oklahoma State in 1992; the Grant Award in 1994; the Wellington Award in 2004, and the INCOSE Pioneer Award with Benjamin S. Blanchard in 2000.[1]\n In 2006, Wolt Fabrycky founded, endowed, and is now Chairman Emeritus of Omega Alpha: the International Systems Engineering Honor Society. He initiated a Systems Engineering Doctoral Dissertation Showcase within Omega Alpha in 2016, with ten superb Systems Engineering doctoral dissertations exhibited during 2016-18. These provide a reliable worldwide benchmark for SE doctoral research. Fabrycky is past president of Alpha Pi Mu and long time member of its Executive Council.
