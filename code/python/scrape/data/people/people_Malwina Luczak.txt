However, after a second year studying philology at Keele University in the UK, she decided to switch to mathematics, and enrolled at St Catherine's College, Oxford. After her first year's examinations, she was able to obtain scholarship support and continue her studies and remain at Oxford for doctoral work.[2] She completed her D.Phil. in 2001 with a dissertation, Probability, algorithms and telecommunication systems, supervised by Colin McDiarmid and Dominic Welsh.[3]\n She became an assistant lecturer at the Statistical Laboratory at the University of Cambridge and then a reader in mathematics at the London School of Economics.
