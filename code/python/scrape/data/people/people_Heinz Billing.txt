{"name": "Heinz Billing", "content": "\n Heinz Billing (7 April 1914 \u2013 4 January 2017) was a German physicist and computer scientist, widely considered a pioneer in the construction of computer systems and computer data storage, who built a prototype laser interferometric gravitational wave detector.[1]\n Billing was born in Salzwedel, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. After studying mathematics and physics in University of G\u00f6ttingen he received his doctorate in 1938 in Munich at the age of 24. During the Second World War he worked in the Aerodynamics Research Institute in G\u00f6ttingen.\n On 3 October 1943 he married Anneliese Oetker. Billing has three children: Heiner Erhard Billing (born 18 November 1944 in Salzwedel), Dorit Gerda Gronefeld Billing (born 27 June 1946 in G\u00f6ttingen) and Arend Gerd Billing (born 19 September 1954 in G\u00f6ttingen).\n He turned 100 in April 2014[2][3] and died on 4 January 2017 at the age of 102.[4] Advanced LIGO detected the third gravitational wave event GW170104 on the same day.[5]\n Billing worked at the Aerodynamic Research Institute in G\u00f6ttingen, where he developed a magnetic drum memory.\n According to Billing's memoirs, published by Genscher, D\u00fcsseldorf (1997), there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse.[6] It took place in G\u00f6ttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing. (For more details see Herbert Bruderer, Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz).\n After a brief stay at the University of Sydney, Billing returned to join the Max Planck Institute for Physics in 1951. From 1952 through 1961 the group under Billing's direction constructed a series of four digital computers: the G1, G2, G1a, and G3.[7]\n He is the designer of the first German sequence-controlled electronic digital computer as well as of the first German stored-program electronic digital computer.[6]\n After transistors had been firmly established, when microelectronics arrived, after scientific computers were slowly overshadowed by commercial applications and computers were mass-produced in factories, Heinz Billing left the computer field in which he had been a pioneer for nearly 30 years.[1]\n In 1972, Billing returned to his original field of physics, at the Max Planck Institute's new location at Garching near Munich.[8] Beginning in 1972, Heinz Billing became involved in gravitational physics, when he tried to verify the detection claims made by American physicist Joseph Weber. Weber's results were considered to be proven wrong by these experiments.[2]\n In 1975, Billing acted on a proposal by Rainer Weiss from the Massachusetts Institute of technology (MIT) to use laser interferometry to detect gravitational waves. He and colleagues built a 3m prototype Michelson interferometer using optical delay lines.[9] From 1980 onward Billing commissioned the development and construction in MPA in Garching of a laser interferometer with an arm length of 30m. Without the knowledge gained from this prototype, the LIGO project would not have been started when it did.[2][10][11][12][13]\n In 1987, Heinz Billing received the Konrad Zuse Medal for the invention of magnetic drum storage. In 2015 he received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n In 1993, the annual Heinz Billing prize for \"outstanding contributions to computational science\" was established by the Max Planck Society in his honor, with a prize amount of 5,000 Euro.[14]\n ", "tags": ["1914 births", "2017 deaths", "German centenarians", "German computer scientists", "German physicists", "Gravitational-wave astronomy", "Max Planck Society people", "Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Use dmy dates from February 2021", "Articles to be expanded from December 2013", "All articles to be expanded", "Articles needing translation from German Wikipedia", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThis article may be expanded with text translated from the corresponding article in German.
