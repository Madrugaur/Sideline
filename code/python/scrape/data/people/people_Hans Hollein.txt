{"name": "Hans Hollein", "content": "\n Hans Hollein (30 March 1934 \u2013 24 April 2014) was an Austrian architect and designer[1] and key figure of postmodern architecture.[2] Some of his most notable works are the Haas House and the Albertina extension in the inner city of Vienna.[3]\n Hollein was born in Vienna, and graduated in 1956 from the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna,[4] where he studied in the master class of Clemens Holzmeister.[5] During 1959 he attended the Illinois Institute of Technology and then in 1960, the University of California, Berkeley, where he completed his Master of Architecture degree.[6] During these years he met Mies van der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright and Richard Neutra.[6] In 1963 he exhibited, Architecture, along with Walter Pichler at Galerie n\u00e4chst St. Stephan in St Stephen Vienna, highlighting their ideas for utopian architecture.[7] Afterwards, he worked for various architectural firms in Sweden and the United States before returning to Vienna, founding his own office in 1964.[1]\n Hollein's early works were small scale designs, such as the Retti candle shop in Vienna, which notably featured a facade constructed of anodized aluminum.[8]\n In 1972, Hollein designed a series of glasses for the American Optical Corps.[8]\n Hollein was a guest professor at Washington University in St. Louis on two separate occasions, the first being 1963\u201364 and the second in 1966. During this period he was also a visiting professor at the Yale School of Architecture. He was a professor at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf between 1967 and 1976, after which he became a professor at the University of Applied Arts Vienna.[9]\n Hollein worked mainly as an architect but also established himself as a designer through his work for the Memphis Group[5] and the Alessi Company. Additionally, he staged various exhibitions, including for the Venice Biennale.[4] In 1980 he designed the stage for a production of Arthur Schnitzler's drama Kom\u00f6die der Verf\u00fchrung (Comedy of Seduction) at Vienna's Burgtheater.[4] In 1985 Hollein was awarded the Pritzker Prize.[1]\n Hollein achieved international fame with his winning competition designs for the Abteiberg Museum in M\u00f6nchengladbach (1972\u201382) and an underground Guggenheim Museum branch in Salzburg (1989). The later hasn't been built, but his ideas for an underground museum still materialised in the Vulcania European Centre of Vulcanology in Auvergne in France (1997\u20132002).[1]\n Starting from the late 1990s, Hollein designed large-scale projects, including bank headquarters in Lichtenstein, Spain and Peru.[1] Starting from 2010 he worked with Ulf Kotz and Christoph Monschein at the Hans Hollein & Partner ZT GmbH.[9]\n Hollein died on 24 April 2014 in Vienna, after a long illness, at the age of 80.[1]\n His son Max Hollein is the Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Previously he was Director and CEO of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the umbrella organization of the de Young Museum and Legion of Honor Museum. He is the former Director of the St\u00e4del Museum, the Liebieghaus and the Schirn Kunsthalle in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.\n Abteiberg Museum, M\u00f6nchengladbach, Germany, 1972\u201382\n Haas-Haus in Vienna, 1985\u201390\n Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt am Main, 1983\u201391\n Austrian Embassy in Berlin, 1996-2001\n Soravia-Wing of the Albertina, Vienna, 2001\u201303\n Car Building, Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe, Germany, 2011\n ", "tags": ["1934 births", "2014 deaths", "Architects from Vienna", "Illinois Institute of Technology alumni", "Members of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts", "Postmodern architects", "Academy of Fine Arts Vienna alumni", "Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf faculty", "Pritzker Architecture Prize winners", "Commanders Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "Honorary Fellows of the American Institute of Architects", "Recipients of the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art", "Recipients of the Grand Austrian State Prize", "Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Recipients of the Grand Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria", "UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design alumni", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from November 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Austrian architect and designer (1934-2014)\n\n\nHans HolleinHollein in 1976Born30 March 1934\u00a0(1934-03-30)Vienna, AustriaDied24 April 2014\u00a0(2014-04-25) (aged\u00a080)Vienna, AustriaNationalityAustrianAlma\u00a0materAcademy of Fine Arts ViennaOccupationArchitect\nHans Hollein (30 March 1934 \u2013 24 April 2014) was an Austrian architect and designer[1] and key figure of postmodern architecture.[2] Some of his most notable works are the Haas House and the Albertina extension in the inner city of Vienna.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Main works\n3 Prizes\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nHollein was born in Vienna, and graduated in 1956 from the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna,[4] where he studied in the master class of Clemens Holzmeister.[5] During 1959 he attended the Illinois Institute of Technology and then in 1960, the University of California, Berkeley, where he completed his Master of Architecture degree.[6] During these years he met Mies van der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright and Richard Neutra.[6] In 1963 he exhibited, Architecture, along with Walter Pichler at Galerie n\u00e4chst St. Stephan in St Stephen Vienna, highlighting their ideas for utopian architecture.[7] Afterwards, he worked for various architectural firms in Sweden and the United States before returning to Vienna, founding his own office in 1964.[1]\nHollein's early works were small scale designs, such as the Retti candle shop in Vienna, which notably featured a facade constructed of anodized aluminum.[8]\nIn 1972, Hollein designed a series of glasses for the American Optical Corps.[8]\nHollein was a guest professor at Washington University in St. Louis on two separate occasions, the first being 1963\u201364 and the second in 1966.
