{"name": "Johann Georg Tralles", "content": "Johann Georg Tralles (15 October 1763 \u2013 19 November 1822) was a German mathematician and physicist.\n He was born in Hamburg, Germany and was educated at the  University of G\u00f6ttingen beginning in 1783. He became a professor at the University of Bern in 1785. In 1810, he became a professor of mathematics at the University of Berlin.\n In 1798 he served as the Swiss representative to the French metric convocation, and was a member of its committee on weights and measures. An iron \"committee\" meter, a duplicate of the prototype archive meter, was then given as a gift to Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler. From 1803 until 1805 these two men worked together on a topological survey of the Canton of Bern.\n In 1819, he discovered the Great Comet of 1819, Comet Tralles, named after him.[1]\n He was the inventor of the alcoholometer, a device for measuring the amount of alcohol in a liquid.\n He died in London, England.
