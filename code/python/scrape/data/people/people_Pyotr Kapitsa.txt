{"name": "Pyotr Kapitsa", "content": "\n Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa or Peter Kapitza (Russian: \u041f\u0451\u0442\u0440 \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0446\u0430, Romanian: Petre Capi\u021ba (8 July\u00a0[O.S. 26 June]\u00a01894[2] \u2013 8 April 1984) was a leading Soviet physicist and Nobel laureate,[3][4] best known for his work in low-temperature physics.\n Kapitsa was born in Kronstadt, Russian Empire, to Bessarabian-Volhynian-born parents Leonid Petrovich Kapitsa (Romanian Leonid Petrovici Capi\u0163a), a military engineer who constructed fortifications, and Olga Ieronimovna Kapitsa from a noble Polish Stebnicki family.[5][6] Besides Russian, the Kapitsa family also spoke Romanian.[7]\n Kapitsa's studies were interrupted by the First World War, in which he served as an ambulance driver for two years on the Polish front.[8] He graduated from the Petrograd Polytechnical Institute in 1918.  His wife and two children died in the flu epidemic of 1918\u201319.  He subsequently studied in Britain, working for over ten years with Ernest Rutherford in the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and founding the influential Kapitza club. He was the first director (1930\u201334) of the Mond Laboratory in Cambridge.\n In the 1920s he originated techniques for creating ultrastrong magnetic fields by injecting high current for brief periods into specially constructed air-core electromagnets. In 1928 he discovered the linear dependence of resistivity on magnetic field strength in various metals for very strong magnetic fields.\n In 1934 Kapitsa returned to Russia to visit his parents but the Soviet Union prevented him from travelling back to Great Britain.\n As his equipment for high-magnetic field research remained in Cambridge (although later Ernest Rutherford negotiated with the British government the possibility of shipping it to the USSR), he changed the direction of his research to the study of low temperature phenomena, beginning with a critical analysis of the existing methods for achieving low temperatures. In 1934 he developed new and original apparatus (based on the adiabatic principle) for making significant quantities of liquid helium.\n Kapitsa formed the Institute for Physical Problems, in part using equipment which the Soviet government bought from the Mond Laboratory in Cambridge (with the assistance of Rutherford, once it was clear that Kapitsa would not be permitted to return).\n In Russia, Kapitsa began a series of experiments to study liquid helium, leading to the discovery in 1937 of its superfluidity (not to be confused with superconductivity).  He reported the properties of this new state of matter in a series of papers, for which he was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for basic inventions and discoveries in the area of low-temperature physics\".\n In 1939 he developed a new method for liquefaction of air with a low-pressure cycle using a special high-efficiency expansion turbine.  Consequently, during World War II he was assigned to head the Department of Oxygen Industry attached to the USSR Council of Ministers, where he developed his low-pressure expansion techniques for industrial purposes. He invented high power microwave generators (1950\u20131955) and discovered a new kind of continuous high pressure plasma discharge with electron temperatures over 1,000,000 K.\n In November 1945, Kapitsa quarreled with Lavrentiy Beria, head of the NKVD and in charge of the Soviet atomic bomb project, writing to Joseph Stalin about Beria's ignorance of physics and his arrogance. Stalin backed Kapitsa, telling Beria he had to cooperate with the scientists. Kapitsa refused to meet Beria: \"If you want to speak to me, then come to the Institute.\" Stalin offered to meet Kapitsa, but this never happened.[9]\n Immediately after the war, a group of prominent Soviet scientists (including Kapitsa in particular) lobbied the government to create a new technical university, the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Kapitsa taught there for many years. From 1957, he was also a member of the presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and at his death in 1984 was the only presidium member who was not also a member of the Communist Party.[10]\n In 1966, Kapitsa was allowed to visit Cambridge to receive the Rutherford Medal and Prize.[11] While dining at his old college, Trinity, he found he did not have the required gown. He asked to borrow one, but a college servant asked him when he last dined at high table, \"Thirty-two years\" replied Kapitza. Within moments the servant-returned, not with any gown, but Kapitsa's own.[12]\n In 1978, Kapitsa won the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his basic inventions and discoveries in the area of low-temperature physics\" and was also cited for his long term role as a leader in the development of this area. He shared the prize with Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson, who won for discovering the cosmic microwave background.[13]\n Kapitsa resistance is the thermal resistance (which causes a temperature discontinuity) at the interface between liquid helium and a solid.\nThe Kapitsa\u2013Dirac effect is a quantum mechanical effect consisting of the diffraction of electrons by a standing wave of light. In fluid dynamics, the Kapitza number is a dimensionless number characterizing the flow of thin films of fluid down an incline.\n Kapitsa was married in 1927 to Anna Alekseevna Krylova (1903-1996), daughter of applied mathematician A.N. Krylov. They had two sons, Sergey and Andrey. Sergey Kapitsa (1928\u20132012) was a physicist and demographer. He was also the host of the popular and long-running Russian scientific TV show Evident, but Incredible.[14] Andrey Kapitsa (1931\u20132011) was a geographer. He was credited with the discovery and naming of Lake Vostok, the largest subglacial lake in Antarctica, which lies 4,000 meters below the continent's ice cap.[15]\n A minor planet, 3437 Kapitsa, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina in 1982, is named after him.[16] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1929.[1] In 1958 he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.[17]\n ", "tags": ["1894 births", "1984 deaths", "People from Kronstadt", "People from Petergofsky Uyezd", "People of the Russian Empire of Polish descent", "People of the Russian Empire of Romanian descent", "Inventors of the Russian Empire", "Physicists of the Russian Empire", "Soviet Nobel laureates", "Soviet physicists", "20th-century physicists", "University and college founders", "Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University alumni", "Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology faculty", "Moscow State University faculty", "Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Members of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina", "Members of the Royal Irish Academy", "Fellows of the American Physical Society", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts", "Russian military personnel of World War I", "Nobel laureates in Physics", "Heroes of Socialist Labour", "Stalin Prize winners", "Recipients of the Order of Lenin", "Niels Bohr International Gold Medal recipients", "Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024", "CS1 Romanian-language sources (ro)", "Subscription required using via", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from June 2015", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BPN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Soviet physicist\n\n\nIn this Eastern Slavic name, the patronymic is  Leonidovich and the family name is  Kapitsa.\nPyotr Kapitsa\u041f\u0451\u0442\u0440 \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0446\u0430Pyotr Kapitsa in the 1930sBornPyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa(1894-07-08)8 July 1894Kronstadt, Russian EmpireDied8 April 1984(1984-04-08) (aged\u00a089)Moscow, Soviet UnionResting placeNovodevichy Cemetery, MoscowNationalityRussian, SovietCitizenshipRussian Empire (1894\u20131917) \u2192 RSFSR (1917\u20131922) \u2192 Soviet Union (1922\u20131984)Known\u00a0forSuperfluidityKapitza's pendulumAwards\nFRS (1929)[1]\nFaraday Medal (1942)\nFranklin Medal (1944)\nLomonosov Gold Medal (1959)\nRutherford Medal and Prize (1966)\nNobel Prize in Physics (1978)\nScientific careerFieldsPhysicsDoctoral studentsDavid Shoenberg\n\nPyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa or Peter Kapitza (Russian: \u041f\u0451\u0442\u0440 \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0446\u0430, Romanian: Petre Capi\u021ba (8 July\u00a0[O.S. 26 June]\u00a01894[2] \u2013 8 April 1984) was a leading Soviet physicist and Nobel laureate,[3][4] best known for his work in low-temperature physics.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Personal life\n3 Honors and awards\n4 See also\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nKapitsa was born in Kronstadt, Russian Empire, to Bessarabian-Volhynian-born parents Leonid Petrovich Kapitsa (Romanian Leonid Petrovici Capi\u0163a), a military engineer who constructed fortifications, and Olga Ieronimovna Kapitsa from a noble Polish Stebnicki family.[5][6] Besides Russian, the Kapitsa family also spoke Romanian.[7]\nKapitsa's studies were interrupted by the First World War, in which he served as an ambulance driver for two years on the Polish front.[8] He graduated from the Petrograd Polytechnical Institute in 1918.
