{"name": "Wolfgang R. Wasow", "content": "Wolfgang R. Wasow (25 July 1909 \u2013 11 September 1993) was an American mathematician known for his work in asymptotic expansions and their applications in differential equations.\n Wasow was born as Wolfgang Richard Thal  in Vevey, Switzerland, to Jewish parents, Alma Thal and Max Richard Kleineibst, who had met in Paris.[1]\nAlma Thal was from Jelgava in Latvia, a part of Czarist Russia at the time. Her family had sent her to Switzerland to put an end to  her political activities. Richard Kleineibst was also a political activist and later gained prominence as a leftwing social democrat in the Weimar Republic. He became a founding member of Socialist Workers' Party of Germany in 1931 and was the first editor in chief of Sozialistische Arbeiter-Zeitung, its main organ.[2]\n Alma Thal moved to Germany in 1910 and then several more times within Germany. And so Wolfgang grew up first in Munich, and then in Freiburg, Heidelberg and Berlin. When Alma Thal married the Munich photographer Eduard Wasow, Wolfgang took his name. In 1921, Wolfgang Wasow was sent to a boarding school in the Magdeburg district of Prussia. He passed the Abitur exam and graduated from the school in 1928. After studies at Humboldt and Sorbonne, he  enrolled at G\u00f6ttingen and passed the Staatsexamen (a government licensing examination for future teachers) in mathematics, physics and geology in 1933.\n Wasow left Germany in 1933 and spent time in Paris and Cambridge before taking a job as a teacher  at  boarding schools for children of (predominantly Jewish) German emigrants in Italy, first  in Florence (1935\u201337) and then in Lana in Alto Adige (1937\u201338). After the closure of the latter school  in 1938 due to the passage of the Italian Racial Laws, Wasow  emigrated to England and then to the United States in 1939.\n Wasow taught at Goddard College\n(1939\u20131941) and Connecticut College (1941\u201342) and\nwas at the same time a PhD student in mathematics\nunder the supervision of Kurt Otto Friedrichs\nat New York University.\nHe received\nhis PhD in 1942 and\nstayed to work as an\ninstructor for mathematics until 1946.\n He then held academic and research positions at\nSwarthmore, UCLA and University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison 1946\u20131957, interrupted by a\nFulbright Fellowship in Rome (1954\u201355).\nHe was appointed full professor of mathematics in 1957\nat \nMadison\nand\nRudolf\nE. Langer Professor of Mathematics in 1973.\nHe was department chair  1970\u201372.\nHe retired in 1980.\n Wolfgang Wasow's main research area was singular perturbation theory. A classical application is the thin boundary layer that forms on a solid surface as a fluid flows over it. Above the boundary layer, the fluid behaves approximately like a perfect fluid. But within the boundary layer, the velocity of the flow changes rapidly from the high velocity above the boundary layer to a velocity of 0 at the solid surface. Many technical problems can be modeled this way, including the flow of a liquid through a pipe and the flow of air over an airplane wing. Boundary layer problems are instances of a more general class of problems that today is part of the field of singular perturbations.\n Starting with his 1941 PhD thesis, Wasow was one of the main contributors to  developing a mathematical theory of the boundary layer problem and singular perturbations. The organizers of a symposium in his honor at the Mathematics Research Center at Madison write:\n In May 1980, the Mathematics Research Center organized a\nsuccessful Advanced Seminar on Singular Perturbations and\nAsymptotics in honor of the retirement of a colleague,\nWolfgang R.
