He was said to be \"the most influential biochemical engineer of modern times\".[1]  In a special issue of a journal dedicated to his work, the editor said \"Jay was one of biochemical engineering\u2019s most creative thinkers and spirited advocates, a true innovator who played an enormous role in establishing biochemical engineering as the dynamic discipline it is today\".[2] His numerous contributions in biotechnology and metabolic engineering have led to multiple awards including the First Merck Award in Metabolic Engineering.[1]\n He is commemorated in the James E. Bailey Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Field of Biological Engineering,[3] by the AIChE Society for Biological Engineering.\n Bailey was the only child of Jim and Doris Bailey, growing up in Rockford, Illinois.[4] He studied chemical engineering at Rice University receiving a BA in 1966 and PhD in 1969 working with Fritz Horn.
