While with Nandikar, Ajitesh along with Rudraprasad Sengupta, Asit Bandopadhyay and Keya Chakrabarty, staged and performed many successful plays - mostly adaptations of Chekhov, Sophocles and such stalwarts; of these, few like Antigone, Teen Poysar Pala (adapted from Three Penny Opera), Manjari Aamer Manjari (adapted from Cherry Orchard) not only drew large audiences but created milestones of success even at the national level.
