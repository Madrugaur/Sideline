{"name": "Anne Bosworth Focke", "content": "Anne Lucy Bosworth Focke (September 29, 1868 \u2013 May 15, 1907) was an American mathematician who became the first mathematics professor at what is now the University of Rhode Island, and later became the first female doctoral student of David Hilbert.\n Bosworth was originally from Woonsocket, Rhode Island.[1][2] When she was four, her father and a younger sister died, and she grew up in a family of women: her mother (a librarian), her grandmother (also widowed), and her aunt.[2]\n Bosworth attended Woonsocket High School,[2] and graduated from Wellesley College in 1890.[1][2][3] At Wellesley, her classmates included mathematicians Grace Andrews and Clara Latimer Bacon.[3]\n She worked for two years as a teacher at Amesbury High School in Massachusetts, and was appointed as an instructor of mathematics at the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (later to become the University of Rhode Island) in early 1892, the first year the school became a college. One month later she became its professor of mathematics and physics.[1][2][3]\n While continuing to work at the college, Bosworth earned a master's degree at the University of Chicago from 1894 through 1896 through summer study with E. H. Moore and Oskar Bolza.[1][2][3]\n In 1898, taking a leave from her work for the college, Bosworth traveled to the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, where she worked under the supervision of David Hilbert. She defended her dissertation there in 1899, and was awarded the Ph.D. in 1900.[4] Her dissertation was Begr\u00fcndung einer vom Parallelenaxiome unabh\u00e4ngigen Streckenrechnung,[5] and concerned non-Euclidean geometry.[2] She was David Hilbert's first female doctoral student,[1] part of a group that later included Nadeschda Gernet (1902), Vera Myller (1906), Margarete Kahn (1909), Klara L\u00f6benstein (1910), and Eva Koehler (1912).[5]\n In 1901 Bosworth married Theodore Moses Focke, an American civil engineer, materials scientist, and applied mathematician whom she had met in G\u00f6ttingen.[2][3] Soon afterwards she followed her husband to Cleveland, Ohio, leaving her academic work (except for assisting her husband in grading) to raise a family of three children. She caught pneumonia in 1907 and died of it.[1]\n ", "tags": ["1868 births", "1907 deaths", "People from Woonsocket, Rhode Island", "19th-century American mathematicians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "Wellesley College alumni", "University of Chicago alumni", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "University of Rhode Island faculty", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nAnne Bosworth FockeBornSeptember 29, 1868Woonsocket, Rhode Island, USDiedMay 15, 1907Cleveland, USNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenUniversity of ChicagoWellesley CollegeScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsRhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic ArtsDoctoral advisorDavid Hilbert\n\nAnne Lucy Bosworth Focke (September 29, 1868 \u2013 May 15, 1907) was an American mathematician who became the first mathematics professor at what is now the University of Rhode Island, and later became the first female doctoral student of David Hilbert.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Undergraduate education and academic work\n3 Graduate education\n4 Later life\n5 References\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nBosworth was originally from Woonsocket, Rhode Island.[1][2] When she was four, her father and a younger sister died, and she grew up in a family of women: her mother (a librarian), her grandmother (also widowed), and her aunt.[2]\n\nUndergraduate education and academic work[edit]\nBosworth attended Woonsocket High School,[2] and graduated from Wellesley College in 1890.[1][2][3] At Wellesley, her classmates included mathematicians Grace Andrews and Clara Latimer Bacon.[3]\nShe worked for two years as a teacher at Amesbury High School in Massachusetts, and was appointed as an instructor of mathematics at the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (later to become the University of Rhode Island) in early 1892, the first year the school became a college.
