{"name": "Dwarkanath Tagore", "content": "\n Dwarkanath Tagore (Bengali: \u09a6\u09cd\u09ac\u09be\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09a8\u09be\u09a5 \u09a0\u09be\u0995\u09c1\u09b0, Darokanath \u0162hakur) (1794\u20131846), one of the first Indian industrialists to form an enterprise  with British partners[1] and entrepreneurs, was the founder of the Jorasanko branch of the Tagore family. He was the grandfather of Rabindranath Tagore.\n \nThe original surname of the Tagores was Kushari. They were Rarhi Brahmins and originally belonged to a village named Kush in the district named Burdwan in West Bengal. The biographer of Rabindranath Tagore, Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyaya wrote in the first volume of his book Rabindrajibani O Rabindra Sahitya Prabeshika that, The Kusharis were the descendants of Deen Kushari, the son of Bhatta Narayana; Deen was granted a village named Kush (in Burdwan zilla) by Maharaja Kshitisura, he became its chief and came to be known as Kushari.[2][3][4][5] Dwarkanath Tagore was a descendant of Rarhiya Brahmins of the Kushari (Sandilya gotra) division. Their ancestors were called Pirali Brahmin[6][7]\n On 12 December 1807, Ramlochan died leaving all his property to his adopted son Dwarkanath, who was then a minor. This property consisted of zamindari estates governed by the complicated Regulations of Permanent Settlement introduced by Lord Cornwallis in 1792. The Zamindars were the ruling authority of a certain sub-division or region under The British ruling authority in India and they (the Zamindars) had the authority to collect tax or to rule their fellow residents inside the territory of their Zamindaris on behalf of the British Government in India. Therefore, to participate in the Zamindari left by his adopted father Ramlochan Thakur as the forthcoming Zamindar, Dwarkanath left school in 1810 at the age of 16 and apprenticed himself under a renowned barrister at Calcutta Robert Cutlar Fergusson and shuttled between Calcutta and his estates at Behrampore and Cuttack.[8]\n Tagore was a western-educated Bengali Brahmin and an acknowledged civic leader of Kolkata who played a pioneering role in setting up a string of commercial ventures\u2014banking, insurance and shipping companies\u2014 in partnership with British traders. In 1828, he became the first Indian bank director. In 1829, he founded Union Bank in Calcutta. He helped found the first[1] Anglo-Indian Managing Agency (industrial organizations that ran jute mills, coal mines, tea plantations, etc.,[9]) Carr, Tagore and Company. Even earlier, Rustomjee Cowasjee, a Parsi in Calcutta, had formed an inter-racial firm but in the early 19th century, Parsis were classified as a Near Eastern community as opposed to South Asian. Tagore's company managed huge zamindari estates spread across today's West Bengal and Odisha states in India, and in Bangladesh, besides holding large stakes in new enterprises that were tapping the rich coal seams of Bengal, running tug services between Calcutta and the mouth of the river Hooghly and transplanting Chinese tea crop to the plains of Upper Assam.  Carr, Tagore and Company was one of those Indian private companies engaged in the opium trade with China. Production of opium was in India and it was sold in China. When the Chinese protested, the East India Company transferred the opium trade to the proxy of certain selected Indian companies, of which this was one.  In 1832 Tagore purchased the first Indian coal mine in Raniganj,[1] which eventually became the Bengal Coal Company.  Very large schooners were engaged in shipments. This made Dwarkanath extremely rich, and there are legends about the extent of his wealth. \"As a zamindar Dwarkanath was mercilessly efficient and businesslike, but not generous\".[10]\n Dwarkanath Tagore died \"at the peak of his fortune\"[1] on the evening of 1 August 1846 at the St. George's Hotel in London during a tremendous thunderstorm with hail the size of walnuts.\n In his obituary, The London Mail newspaper of 7 August wrote:\n ", "tags": ["1794 births", "1846 deaths", "Bengali people", "Bengali zamindars", "Businesspeople from Kolkata", "Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery", "Tagore family", "Indian businesspeople in coal", "Bengali Hindus", "Indian businesspeople in mining", "Indian businesspeople in textiles", "Businesspeople in the sugar industry", "Articles with peacock terms from June 2020", "All articles with peacock terms", "Use dmy dates from May 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Bengali-language text", "Articles with Bengali-language sources (bn)", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article contains wording that promotes the subject in a subjective manner without imparting real information.
