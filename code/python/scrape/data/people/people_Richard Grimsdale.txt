{"name": "Richard Grimsdale", "content": "\n Richard Lawrence Grimsdale (18 September 1929 \u2013 6 December 2005) was a British electrical engineer and computer pioneer who helped to design the world's first transistorised computer.\n Richard Lawrence Grimsdale was born on 18 September 1929 in Australia, where his father, an English engineer, was working on construction of the suburban railway system for the Metropolitan-Vickers company. The family returned to England, where he was educated at Manchester Grammar, and then studied electrical engineering at Manchester University, where he earned his Bachelor of Science,[1] his Master of Science in 1951, writing a thesis on \"Computing Machines - Design of Test Programmes\",[2] and ultimately his Doctor of Philosophy, writing his thesis on the \"Transistor Digital Computer\" under the supervision of Frederic Calland Williams.[3]\n In 1953, whilst still a post-graduate research student at Manchester University, Grimsdale achieved one of the first major landmarks in his career with his design and development work on the Metrovick 950, the world's first computer made from transistors rather than valves or electromechanical devices. The computer used early point-contact transistors which were the first generation of transistors, however later developments of the machine used more advanced junction transistors which offered better performance.\n Grimsdale also worked on the Ferranti Mark I computer, a commercial development of the Manchester Mark 1 computer. He also designed the 100-nanosecond read-only memory for the Atlas computer.[4] He remained at Manchester University until 1960, then began to work at Associated Electrical Industries as a research engineer. In 1967 he left AEI and joined the Sussex University's electrical engineering faculty as a lecturer. His research at Sussex University included work on computer graphics, computer networking systems and VLSI accelerator chips for generating three-dimensional images.\n Grimsdale died from a heart infection at his home in Brighton on 6 December 2005. He was survived by his wife Shirley Roberts Grimsdale and daughters Susan and Kathryn.[5]\n ", "tags": ["1929 births", "2005 deaths", "British electrical engineers", "British electronics engineers", "Alumni of the University of Manchester", "Academics of the University of Sussex", "Use dmy dates from April 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nRichard GrimsdaleBorn(1929-09-18)18 September 1929Died6 December 2005(2005-12-06) (aged\u00a076)Brighton, EnglandNationalityEnglishAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Manchester (BSc, MSc, PhD)Known\u00a0forAtlas (computer)Manchester computersSpouse(s)Shirley Roberts GrimsdaleScientific careerInstitutionsUniversity of ManchesterSussex UniversityThesisTransistor Digital Computer\u00a0(1955)Doctoral advisorFrederic Calland Williams\n\nRichard Lawrence Grimsdale (18 September 1929 \u2013 6 December 2005) was a British electrical engineer and computer pioneer who helped to design the world's first transistorised computer.\n\nEarly life[edit]\nRichard Lawrence Grimsdale was born on 18 September 1929 in Australia, where his father, an English engineer, was working on construction of the suburban railway system for the Metropolitan-Vickers company.
