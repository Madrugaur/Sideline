{"name": "Simon von Stampfer", "content": "Simon Ritter von Stampfer (26 October 1792 (according to other sources 1790)), in Windisch-Mattrai, Archbishopric of Salzburg today called Matrei in Osttirol, Tyrol \u2013 10 November 1864 in Vienna) was an Austrian mathematician, surveyor and inventor. His most famous invention is that of the stroboscopic disk which has a claim to be the first device to show moving images. Almost simultaneously similar devices were produced independently in Belgium (the phenakistiskop), and Britain (the D\u00e6daleum, years later to appear as the Zoetrope).\n Simon Ritter von Stampfer was born in Matrei in Osttirol, and was the first son of  Bartlm\u00e4 Stampfer, a weaver.  From 1801 he attended the local school and in  1804 and moved to the Franciscan Gymnasium in Lienz, where he studied until 1807. From there he went to the Lyceum in Salzburg, to study  philosophy, however he was not assessed. \n In 1814 in Munich, he passed the state examination  and applied there as a teacher. He chose, however, to stay in Salzburg, where he was assistant teacher in mathematics, natural history, physics and Greek at the high school. He then moved to the Lyceum, where he taught elementary mathematics, physics and applied mathematics . In 1819 he was also appointed a professor. In his spare time he made  geodetic measurements, astronomical observations, experiments on the propagation speed of sound at different heights and measurements using the barometer. Stampfer was often to be seen in the Benedictine Monastery of Kremsm\u00fcnster which had numerous pieces of astronomical equipment available. \n In 1822, von Stampfer married Johanna Wagner.

However, at the Polytechnic Institute in Vienna, he was also  promoted to the Chair of Practical Geometry. He settled there in December 1825 to replace Franz Josef von Gerstner. He now taught Practical geometry, but was also employed as a physicist and astronomer. He produced a method for the computation of solar eclipses. \n He was concerned about his astronomical work with lenses and their accuracy and distortion.  This led him to the field of optical illusions. In 1828, he developed test methods for telescopes and methods of measurement to determine the \"Kr\u00fcmmungshalbmesser\" of lenses and the refractive and dispersion property of the glass. For his work on the theoretical foundations of the production of high quality optics, he turned to the achromatic Fraunhofer lens.\n In  1832 Stampfer became aware through the Journal of Physics and Mathematics of experiments by the British physicist, Michael Faraday, on the optical illusion caused by rapidly rotating gears, in which  the human eye could not follow the movement of the gear. He was so impressed that he conducted similar experiments with gears and \"tooth slices\".  From these experiments he eventually developed the Stampfer Disc (also called the Zoetrope, Stroboskopische Sheiben, Stroboscope Discs, optical magic disc, or simply Stroboscope ). It consists of two  disks: One with slits around its circumference, and another with images in frames of motion. When the slitted disk is turned on the same axis as the image disk, the view through the slits  gives the impression of a continuously moving image.[1] Alternatively a single disk would be spun in front of a mirror and the image viewed in the mirror through the slots of the disk.\n Belgian scientist Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau had been developing the a very similar device for some time and finally published about what would later be named the Fantascope or Ph\u00e9nakisticope in January 1833 in a Belgian scientific periodical, illustrated with a plate of the device.[2] Plateau mentioned in 1836 that he thought it difficult to state the exact time when he got the idea, but he believed he was first able to successfully assemble his invention in December.
