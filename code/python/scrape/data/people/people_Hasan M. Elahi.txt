Wired magazine reports:\n Poke around his site and you'll find more than 20,000 images stretching back three years. Elahi has documented nearly every waking hour of his life during that time.

The Bangladeshi-born American says the US government mistakenly listed him on its terrorist watch list \u2014 and once you're on, it's hard to get off. To convince the Feds of his innocence, Elahi has made his life an open book. Whenever they want, officials can go to his site and see where he is and what he's doing.
