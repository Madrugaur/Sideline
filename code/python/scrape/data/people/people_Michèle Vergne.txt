{"name": "Mich\u00e8le Vergne", "content": "Mich\u00e8le Vergne (born August 29, 1943 in  L\u2019Isle-Adam, Val d\u00b4Oise) is a French mathematician, specializing in analysis and representation theory.\n Mich\u00e8le Vergne studied from 1962 to 1966 at the \u00c9cole Normal Sup\u00e9rieure de jeunes filles, which today is part of the ENS. She wrote her diploma thesis 1966 with Claude Chevalley, entitled \"Vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des alg\u00e8bres de Lie nilpotentes\" and her doctoral thesis in 1971 under the supervision of Jacques Dixmier (\"Recherches sur les groupes et les alg\u00e8bres de Lie\") at the University of Paris. She is currently Directeur de Recherche at CNRS.\n Vergne worked in the construction of unitary representations of Lie groups using coadjoint orbits of the Lie algebras. She proved a generalized Poisson summation formula (called by its Poisson-Plancherel formula), which is the integral of a function on adjoint orbits with their Fourier transformation integrals on coadjoint \"quantized\" orbits.\n Further, she studied the index theory of elliptic differential operators and generalizations of this to equivariant cohomology. With Nicole Berline, it became a link between Atiyah-Bott fixed-point formulas and Kirillov character formula in 1985.[1] The theory has applications to physics (e.g., some works of Edward Witten).\n In addition she also worked in the geometry of numbers; more specifically, the number of integer points in convex polyhedra.\n With Masaki Kashiwara, she formulated a conjecture about the combinatorial structure of the enveloping algebras of Lie algebras.[vague]\n Since 1997, she is a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences. She received the Prix Amp\u00e8re in 1997. She is a member of The American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1992, she gave a plenary lecture at the first European Congress of Mathematics in Paris (Cohomologie equivariante et formules de car\u00e1cteres). In 2006 she gave a plenary lecture at the International Congress of mathematics in Madrid (Applications of Equivariant Cohomology) and in 1983 she was an invited speaker at the ICM in Warsaw (Formule de Kirilov et indice de l'op\u00e9rateur de Dirac).
