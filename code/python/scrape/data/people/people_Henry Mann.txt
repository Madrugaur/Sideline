{"name": "Henry Mann", "content": "Henry Berthold Mann (27 October 1905, Vienna \u2013 1 February 2000, Tucson)[1] was a professor of mathematics and statistics at Ohio State University. Mann proved the Schnirelmann-Landau conjecture in number theory, and as a result earned the 1946 Cole Prize. He and his student developed the (\"Mann-Whitney\") U-statistic of nonparametric statistics.[2] Mann published the first mathematical book on the design of experiments: Mann (1949).[3]\n Born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, to a Jewish family, Mann earned his Ph.D. degree in mathematics in 1935 from the University of Vienna under the supervision of Philipp Furtw\u00e4ngler.[2][4] Mann immigrated to the United States in 1938, and lived in New York, supporting himself by tutoring students.[2]\n In additive number theory, Mann proved the Schnirelmann\u2013Landau conjecture on the asymptotic density of sumsets in 1942.[5] By doing so he established Mann's theorem and earned the 1946 Cole Prize.[2][6]\n In 1942 the Carnegie Foundation awarded Mann a fellowship to learn statistics while assisting the operations research group of Harold Hotelling at Columbia University. His group also supported Abraham Wald, and Wald and Mann collaborated on several papers. In statistics, Mann is known for the (\"Mann\u2013Whitney\") U-statistic and its associated hypothesis test for nonparametric statistics. Collaborating with Wald, Mann developed the Mann\u2013Wald theorem of asymptotic statistics and econometrics.[2]\n Mann wrote the first mathematical book on the design of experiments Mann (1949), whose principles allowed later statisticians to design and to analyze customized experiments. Like contemporary \"self-help\" and \"how to\"  books, the earlier books gave easy-to-follow examples but little theory beyond exhortations to follow three principles of Ronald A. Fisher\u2014to \"replicate\", to \"establish control\" (for example with blocking), and to \"randomize\" (assignment of treatments to units). Earlier books provided useful examples of designed experiments along with the design's analysis of variance, but no basis for constructing new designs for new problems, according to Johnson (1951).[3]\n According to Denis Conniffe: \n Ronald A. Fisher was \"interested in application and in the popularization\nof statistical methods and his early book Statistical Methods for Research Workers, published in 1925, went through many editions and\nmotivated and influenced the practical use of statistics in many fields of\nstudy. His Design of Experiments (1935)  [promoted] statistical technique and application. In that book he\nemphasized examples and how\u00a0to\u00a0design experiments systematically from\na statistical point of view. The mathematical justification of the methods\ndescribed was not stressed and, indeed, proofs were often barely sketched\nor omitted altogether ..., a fact which led H.\u00a0B.\u00a0Mann to fill the gaps with a rigorous mathematical treatment in his well known treatise, Mann (1949).\"[7]\n In 1946 Mann returned to Ohio State University, where he served as a professor mathematics until his retirement in 1964.
