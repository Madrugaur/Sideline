He was imprisoned on an island near Baku, and then transferred to the infamous Cheka prison, Lubianka in Moscow.  He was released after three months when it became apparent that he had contracted malaria.

This process, which is known as the \u201cAndrussow Process\u201d, is the most important method for the industrial production of hydrogen cyanide as a preliminary product for the synthesis of polyamide 66 (nylon) and for acrylic glass (polymethyl methacrylate).\n1932 Work on the catalytical alkylation with ether for the industrial production of purest dimethylaniline.\nConversion of tetrachlorethane to methylene chloride and trichlorethylene.\nNumerous works on rocket fuels, among others the introduction of the system nitric acid and amines or other fuels.
