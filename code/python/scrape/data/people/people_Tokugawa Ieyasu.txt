{"name": "Tokugawa Ieyasu", "content": "\n Among others...\n Tokugawa Ieyasu (Born:Matsudaira Takechiyo (\u5fb3\u5ddd\u5bb6\u5eb7, January 31, 1543 \u2013 June 1, 1616) was the founder and first sh\u014dgun of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan, which ruled Japan from 1603 until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. \nHe was one of the three \"Great Unifiers\" of Japan, along with his former lord Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\n The son of a minor daimyo, Ieyasu once lived as a hostage, on behalf of his father, under another daimyo.[1] He later succeeded as daimyo after his father's death, serving as vassal and general under Oda Nobunaga,[1] building up his strength.[2]\n After Nobunaga's death, Ieyasu was briefly a rival of fellow Oda subordinate Toyotomi Hideyoshi, before declaring allegiance to Toyotomi and fighting on his behalf.[1] Under Toyotomi, Ieyasu was relocated to the Kanto plains in eastern Japan, away from the Toyotomi power base in Osaka.[1] He built his castle in the fishing village of Edo (now Tokyo).[1] He became the most powerful daimyo and the most senior officer under the Toyotomi regime.[2]\n Ieyasu preserved his strength in Toyotomi's failed attempt to conquer Korea.[1] After Toyotomi's death, Ieyasu seized power in 1600, after the Battle of Sekigahara.[1] He received appointment as sh\u014dgun in 1603, and voluntarily abdicated from office in 1605, but remained in power until his death in 1616. He implemented a set of careful rules known as the bakuhan system, designed to keep the daimyo and samurai in check under the Tokugawa Shogunate.[1][2]\n His given name is sometimes spelled Iyeyasu,[3][4] according to the historical pronunciation of the kana character we. Ieyasu was posthumously enshrined at Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b with the name T\u014dsh\u014d Daigongen (\u6771\u7167\u5927\u6b0a\u73fe).\n During the Muromachi period, the Matsudaira clan controlled a portion of Mikawa Province (the eastern half of modern Aichi Prefecture). Ieyasu's father, Matsudaira Hirotada, was a minor local warlord based at Okazaki Castle who controlled a portion of the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway linking Kyoto with the eastern provinces. His territory was sandwiched between stronger and predatory neighbors, including the Imagawa clan based in Suruga Province to the east and the Oda clan to the west. Hirotada's main enemy was Oda Nobuhide, the father of Oda Nobunaga.[5]\n Tokugawa Ieyasu was born in Okazaki Castle on the 26th day of the twelfth month of the eleventh year of Tenbun, according to the Japanese calendar. Originally named Matsudaira Takechiyo (\u677e\u5e73 \u7af9\u5343\u4ee3), he was the son of Matsudaira Hirotada (\u677e\u5e73 \u5ee3\u5fe0), the daimy\u014d of Mikawa of the Matsudaira clan, and Odai no Kata (\u65bc\u5927\u306e\u65b9, Lady Odai), the daughter of a neighbouring samurai lord, Mizuno Tadamasa (\u6c34\u91ce \u5fe0\u653f). His mother and father were step-siblings. They were just 17 and 15 years old, respectively, when Ieyasu was born.[6]\n In the year of Ieyasu's birth, the Matsudaira clan was split. In 1543, Hirotada's uncle, Matsudaira Nobutaka defected to the Oda clan. This gave Oda Nobuhide the confidence to attack Okazaki. Soon afterwards, Hirotada's father-in-law died, and his son Mizuno Nobumoto revived the clan's traditional enmity against the Matsudaira and declared for Oda Nobuhide as well. As a result, Hirotada divorced Odai-no-kata and sent her back to her family.[5] Hirotada later remarried to different wives, and Ieyasu eventually had 11 half-brothers and sisters.[6]\n As Oda Nobuhide continued to attack Okazaki, Hirotada turned to his powerful eastern neighbour, Imagawa Yoshimoto for assistance. Yoshimoto agreed to an alliance under the condition that Hirotada send his young heir to Sunpu Domain as a hostage.[5]\nOda Nobuhide learned of this arrangement and had Ieyasu abducted and taken to Sunpu.[7] Ieyasu was just five years old at the time.[8]\nNobuhide threatened to execute Ieyasu unless his father severed all ties with the Imagawa clan. However, Hirotada refused, stating that sacrificing his own son would show his seriousness in his pact with the Imagawa. Despite this refusal, Nobuhide chose not to kill Ieyasu, but instead held him as a hostage for the next three years at the Honsh\u014dji temple in Nagoya (It is said that Oda Nobunaga met Ieyasu at this place, since Ieyasu was 6 years old, and Nobunaga was 14 at that time.)\n In 1549, when Ieyasu was 6,[8] his father Hirotada was murdered by his own vassals, who had been bribed by the Oda clan. At about the same time, Oda Nobuhide died during an epidemic. Nobuhide's death dealt a heavy blow to the Oda clan.\n In 1551, an army under the command of Imagawa Sessai laid siege to the castle where Oda Nobuhiro, Nobuhide's eldest son, was living. Nobuhiro was trapped by the Imagawa clan, but was saved by Oda Nobunaga, Nobuhide's second son, through negotiations. Sessai made an agreement with Nobunaga to take Ieyasu back to Imagawa, and he agreed. So Ieyasu (now nine years old) was taken as a hostage to Sunpu. At Sunpu, he remained a hostage, but was treated fairly well as a potentially useful future ally of the Imagawa clan until 1556 when he was 14 years old.[8]\n In 1556, Ieyasu officially came of age, with Imagawa Yoshimoto presiding over his genpuku ceremony. Following tradition, he changed his name from Matsudaira Takechiyo to Matsudaira Jir\u014dsabur\u014d Motonobu (\u677e\u5e73 \u6b21\u90ce\u4e09\u90ce \u5143\u4fe1). He was also briefly allowed to visit Okazaki to pay his respects to the tomb of his father, and receive the homage of his nominal retainers, led by the kar\u014d Torii Tadayoshi.[5]\n One year later, at the age of 15 (according to East Asian age reckoning), he married his first wife, Lady Tsukiyama, a relative of Imagawa Yoshimoto, and changed his name again to Matsudaira Kurandonosuke Motoyasu (\u677e\u5e73 \u8535\u4eba\u4f50 \u5143\u5eb7). A year later, their son, Matsudaira Nobuyasu, was born. He was then allowed to return to Mikawa Province. There, the Imagawa then ordered him to fight the Oda clan in a series of battles.[citation needed]\n Motoyasu fought his first battle in 1558 at the Siege of Terabe. The lord of Terabe, Suzuki Shigeteru, betrayed the Imagawa by defecting to Oda Nobunaga. This was nominally within Matsudaira territory, so Imagawa Yoshimoto entrusted the campaign to Ieyasu and his retainers from Okazaki. Ieyasu led the attack in person, but after taking the outer defences, he burned the main castle and withdrew. As anticipated, the Oda forces attacked his rear lines, but Motoyasu was prepared and drove off the Oda army.[9]\n He then succeeded in delivering supplies in the Siege of Odaka a year later. Odaka was the only one of five disputed frontier forts under attack by the Oda which remained in Imagawa hands. Motoyasu launched diversionary attacks against the two neighboring forts, and when the garrisons of the other forts went to their assistance, Ieyasu's supply column was able to reach Odaka.[10]\n By 1559 the leadership of the Oda clan had passed to Oda Nobunaga. In 1560, Imagawa Yoshimoto leading a large army of 25,000 men, invaded Oda clan territory. Motoyasu was assigned a separate mission to capture the stronghold of Marune. As a result, he and his men were not present at the Battle of Okehazama where Yoshimoto was killed in Nobunaga's surprise assault.[7]:37\n With Yoshimoto dead, and the Imagawa clan in a state of confusion, Motoyasu used the opportunity to assert his independence and marched his men back into the abandoned Okazaki Castle and reclaimed his ancestral seat.[9]\nMotoyasu then decided to ally with Oda Nobunaga.[11]\nA secret deal was needed because Motoyasu's wife, Lady Tsukiyama, and infant son, Nobuyasu, were held hostage in Sumpu by Imagawa Ujizane, Yoshimoto's heir.[citation needed]\n In 1561, Motoyasu openly broke with the Imagawa and captured the fortress of Kaminog\u014d. Kaminog\u014d was held by Udono Nagamochi. Resorting to stealth, Motoyasu forces under Hattori Hanz\u014d attacked under cover of darkness, setting fire to the castle, and capturing two of Udono's sons, whom he used as hostages to exchange for his wife and son.[10]:216\n In 1563, Nobuyasu, the first son of Motoyasu, was married to Nobunaga's daughter Tokuhime. In the same year in February, Motoyasu changed his name to Ieyasu.[12][13]\nFor the next few years Ieyasu was occupied with reforming the Matsudaira clan and pacifying Mikawa. He also strengthened his key vassals by awarding them land and castles. These vassals included \u014ckubo Tadayo, Ishikawa Kazumasa, K\u014driki Kiyonaga, Sakai Tadatsugu, Honda Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa and Hattori Hanz\u014d.[citation needed]\n During this period, the Matsudaira clan also faced a threat from a different source. Mikawa was a major center for the Ikk\u014d-ikki movement, where peasants banded together with militant monks under the J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b sect, and rejected the traditional feudal social order. Ieyasu undertook several battles to suppress this movement in his territories, including the Battle of Azukizaka (1564).[10]:216\n On January 15, 1564, Ieyasu had decided to concentrate his forces to attack and eliminating the Ikki from Mikawa. In the Ikki ranks were some of Ieyasu's vassals, like Honda Masanobu and Natsume Yoshinobu, who had turned over to the Ikki rebellion on religious sympathy.\n Ieyasu was fighting in the front line and was nearly killed when struck by several bullets which did not penetrate his armour. Both sides were using the new gunpowder weapons which the Portuguese had introduced to Japan just 20 years earlier. Ieyasu's brave conduct in the battle convinced many of the samurai in the Ikki to switch sides and the Ikki were defeated.[citation needed]\n In 1565, Matsudaira Ieyasu became master of all of Mikawa Province. In 1567 Ieyasu changed his name yet again and started the family name \"Tokugawa\", this time to Tokugawa Ieyasu. As he was a member of the Matsudaira clan, he claimed descent from the Seiwa Genji branch of the Minamoto clan. However, there was no proof the Matsudaira clan are descendants of Emperor Seiwa.[14] Yet, his surname was changed with the permission of the Imperial Court, after writing a petition, and he was bestowed the courtesy title \"Mikawa-no-kami\" and the court rank of \"Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f9e\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b, ju go-i no ge)\". Though the Tokugawa could claim some modicum of freedom, they were very much subject to the requests of Oda Nobunaga. Ieyasu remained an ally of Nobunaga and his Mikawa soldiers were part of Nobunaga's army which captured Kyoto in 1568. At the same time, Ieyasu was eager to expand eastward to T\u014dt\u014dmi province. Ieyasu and Takeda Shingen, the head of the Takeda clan in Kai Province, made an alliance for the purpose of conquering all the Imagawa territory.[15]:279\n In 1569, Ieyasu's troops penetrated into T\u014dt\u014dmi Province. Meanwhile, Shingen's troops captured Suruga Province (including the Imagawa capital of Sunpu). Imagawa Ujizane fled to Kakegawa Castle, which lead to Ieyasu to lead the Siege of Kakegawa. Ieyasu then negotiated with Ujizane, promising that if he should surrender himself and the remainder of T\u014dt\u014dmi, he would assist Ujizane in regaining Suruga. Ujizane had nothing left to lose, and Ieyasu immediately ended his alliance with Takeda, instead making a new alliance with Takeda's enemy to the north, Uesugi Kenshin of the Uesugi clan. Through these political manipulations, Ieyasu gained the support of the samurai of T\u014dt\u014dmi Province.[9]\n In 1570, Ieyasu established Hamamatsu as the capital of his territory, placing his son Nobuyasu in charge of Okazaki.[16]\n In 1570, Asai Nagamasa, brother in law of Oda Nobunaga, during Siege of Kanegasaki broke their alliance with the Oda clans. Soon Nobunaga was ready to punish Nagamasa for his treachery. Ieyasu led 5,000 of his men to support Nobunaga at the battle.[7]:62\nThe Battle of Anegawa occurred near Lake Biwa in \u014cmi Province, Japan. The allied forces of Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu defeated the combined forces of the Azai clans and Asakura clans, and saw Nobunaga's prodigious use of firearms. It is notable as the first battle that involved the alliance between Nobunaga and Ieyasu.\n In October 1571, Takeda Shingen broke the alliance with Oda-Tokugawa clan and now allied with the Odawara H\u014dj\u014d clan. He decided to make a drive for Kyoto at the urgings of the sh\u014dgun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, starting with invading Tokugawa lands in T\u014dt\u014dmi. Takeda Shingen's first objective in his campaign against Ieyasu was Nishikawa Castle, Yoshida Castle and Futamata Castle. In 1572, after besieging Futamata, Shingen would press on past Futamata towards the major Tokugawa home castle at Hamamatsu. Later, Ieyasu asked for help from Nobunaga, who sent him some 3,000 troops. Early in 1573 the two armies met at the Battle of Mikatagahara, north Hamamatsu. The considerably larger Takeda army, under the expert direction of Shingen, overwhelmed Ieyasu's troops and caused heavy casualties. Despite his initial reluctance, Ieyasu was convinced by his generals to retreat.[17][16] The battle was a major defeat, but in the interests of maintaining the appearance of dignified withdrawal, Ieyasu brazenly ordered the men at his castle to light torches, sound drums, and leave the gates open, to properly receive the returning warriors. To the surprise and relief of the Tokugawa army, this spectacle made the Takeda generals suspicious of being led into a trap, so they did not besiege the castle and instead made camp for the night.[17] This error would allow a band of Tokugawa soldiers to raid the camp in the ensuing hours, further upsetting the already disoriented Takeda army, and ultimately resulting in Shingen's decision to call off the offensive altogether. Takeda Shingen would not get another chance to advance on Hamamatsu, much less Kyoto, since he would perish shortly after the Siege of Noda Castle later that same year.[11]:153\u2013156\n Shingen was succeeded by his less capable son Takeda Katsuyori. In 1574, Katsuyori took Takatenjin fortress. Then, in 1575, during Takeda Katsuyori's raid through Mikawa Province, he attacked Yoshida castle and besieged Nagashino castle in Mikawa Province. Ieyasu appealed to Nobunaga for help and Nobunaga came personally with 30,000 strong men. The Oda-Tokugawa forces of 38,000 won a great victory and successfully defended Nagashino castle. Though the Takeda forces had been destroyed, Katsuyori survived the battle and retreated back to Kai Province.[18] \nFor the next seven years, Ieyasu and Katsuyori fought a series of small battles, as the result of which Ieyasu's troops managed to wrest control of Suruga Province away from the Takeda clan.\n In 1579, Lady Tsukiyama, Ieyasu' wife, and his heir Nobuyasu, were accused by Nobunaga of conspiring with Takeda Katsuyori to assassinate Nobunaga, whose daughter Tokuhime was married to Nobuyasu. For this reason, Ieyasu ordered his wife to be executed and forced his son to commit seppuku. Ieyasu then named his third son, Tokugawa Hidetada, as heir, since his second son had been adopted by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who would later become an extremely powerful daimyo.[citation needed]\n In 1580, Oda-Tokugawa forces launched the second siege of Takatenjin; the siege came only six years after Takeda Katsuyori had taken the fortress. This second siege lasted from 1580 until 22 March 1581, and ended with the deaths of 680 men in the Okabe Motonobu garrison.\n The end of the war with Takeda came in 1582 when a combined Oda-Tokugawa force attacked and conquered Kai Province. Takeda Katsuyori was defeated at the Battle of Tenmokuzan, and then committed seppuku.[10]:231\n In late June 1582, before the incident at Honn\u014d-ji temple, Nobunaga invited Ieyasu to tour the Kansai region in celebration of the demise of the Takeda clan. When he learned that Nobunaga had been killed at the Honn\u014d-ji temple by Akechi Mitsuhide, this meant that some provinces, ruled by Nobunaga's vassals, were ripe for conquest. Later, Ieyasu traveled back to Mikawa for gathering his forces. With the help of his retainer and ninja leader Hattori Hanz\u014d, Ieyasu first went through Sakai, then crossed the mountains of Iga Province, finally reaching the shore in Ise Province. He returned to his home Mikawa Province by sea. Ieyasu was mobilizing his army when he learned Hideyoshi had defeated Akechi Mitsuhide at the Battle of Yamazaki.[15]:314\u2013315\n After the death of Nobunaga at Honn\u014d-ji castle, the leader of Kai province made the mistake of killing one of Ieyasu's aides. Because of this, Ieyasu promptly invaded Kai and took control. H\u014dj\u014d Ujimasa, leader of the H\u014dj\u014d clan responded by sending his much larger army into Shinano and then into Kai province. Later, both Ieyasu and the H\u014dj\u014d clan agreed to a settlement which left Ieyasu in control of both Kai and Shinano Provinces, while the H\u014dj\u014d took control of Kazusa Province (as well as bits of both Kai and Shinano Provinces).[citation needed]\n In 1583, a war for rule over Japan was fought between Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Shibata Katsuie. Ieyasu did not take a side in this conflict, building on his reputation for both caution and wisdom. Hideyoshi defeated Katsuie at Battle of Shizugatake. With this victory, Hideyoshi became the single most powerful daimy\u014d in Japan.[15]:314\n In 1584, Ieyasu decided to support Oda Nobukatsu, the eldest surviving son and heir of Oda Nobunaga, against Hideyoshi. This was a dangerous act and could have resulted in the annihilation of the Tokugawa, due to the fact that the Oda clan collapsed after Nobunaga's death.[citation needed]\n Tokugawa troops took the traditional Oda stronghold of Owari. Hideyoshi responded by sending an army into Owari. The Komaki and Nagakute Campaign was the only time any of the great unifiers of Japan fought each other.\n The Komaki and Nagakute campaign proved indecisive and after months of fruitless marches and feints, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu settled the war through negotiation. First, Hideyoshi made peace with Oda Nobukatsu, and then he offered a truce to Ieyasu. The deal was made at the end of the year; as part of the terms Ieyasu's second son, Ogimaru (also known as Yuki Hideyasu) became an adopted son of Hideyoshi.[citation needed]\n Ieyasu's aide, Ishikawa Kazumasa, chose to join the pre-eminent daimy\u014d and so he moved to Osaka to be with Hideyoshi. However, few other Tokugawa retainers followed this example.[citation needed]\n Hideyoshi was understandably distrustful of Ieyasu, and five years passed before they fought as allies. The Tokugawa did not participate in Hideyoshi's successful Invasion of Shikoku (1585) and Ky\u016bsh\u016b Campaign (1587).[citation needed]\n In 1590, Hideyoshi attacked the last independent daimy\u014d in Japan, H\u014dj\u014d Ujimasa. The H\u014dj\u014d clan ruled the eight provinces of the Kant\u014d region in eastern Japan. Hideyoshi ordered them to submit to his authority and they refused. Ieyasu, though a friend and occasional ally of Ujimasa, joined his large force of 30,000 samurai with Hideyoshi's enormous army of some 160,000. Odawara Campaign is the first battle of Ieyasu and Hideyoshi as allies. They attacked several castles on the borders of the H\u014dj\u014d clan with most of his army laying siege to the castle at Odawara. Hideyoshi's and Ieyasu's army captured Odawara after six months (oddly for the time period, deaths on both sides were few). During this siege, Hideyoshi offered Ieyasu a radical deal: He offered Ieyasu the eight Kant\u014d provinces which they were about to take from the H\u014dj\u014d in return for the five provinces that Ieyasu currently controlled (including Ieyasu's home province of Mikawa). Ieyasu accepted this proposal. Bowing to the overwhelming power of the Toyotomi army, the H\u014dj\u014d accepted defeat, their leaders committed suicide and Ieyasu marched in and took control of their provinces, ending the clan's reign of over 100 years.[citation needed]\n The Sannohe faction led by Nanbu Nobunao organized a coalition of most of the Nanbu clans and pledged allegiance to Toyotomi Hideyoshi at the Siege of Odawara. In return, he was recognized as chieftain of the Nanbu clans, and confirmed as daimy\u014d of his existing holdings in the northern districts of Mutsu Province. However, Kunohe Masazane, who felt that he had a stronger claim to the title of clan chieftain, immediately rose in rebellion.\nIn 1591, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu took the Kunohe Rebellion as a personal affront to Toyotomi authority and by mid-year organized a retaliatory army to retake northern T\u014dhoku and to restore the area to Nanbu Nobunao's control.\n Ieyasu now gave up control of his five provinces (Mikawa, T\u014dt\u014dmi, Suruga, Shinano, and Kai) and moved all his soldiers and vassals to the Kant\u014d region. He himself occupied the castle town of Edo in Kant\u014d. This was possibly the riskiest move Ieyasu ever made\u2014to leave his home province and rely on the uncertain loyalty of the formerly H\u014dj\u014d samurai in Kant\u014d. In the end, it worked out brilliantly for Ieyasu. He reformed the Kant\u014d region, controlled and pacified the H\u014dj\u014d samurai and improved the underlying economic infrastructure of the lands. Also, because Kant\u014d was somewhat isolated from the rest of Japan, Ieyasu was able to maintain a unique level of autonomy from Hideyoshi's rule. Within a few years, Ieyasu had become the second most powerful daimy\u014d in Japan. There is a Japanese proverb which likely refers to this event: \"Ieyasu won the Empire by retreating.\"[19]\n In 1592, Hideyoshi invaded Korea as a prelude to his plan to attack China. The Tokugawa samurai never actually took part in this campaign, though in early 1593, Ieyasu himself was summoned to Hideyoshi's court in Nagoya (in Ky\u016bsh\u016b, different from the similarly spelled city in Owari Province) as a military advisor and given command of a body of troops meant as reserves for the Korean campaign. He stayed in Nagoya off and on for the next five years.[15] Despite his frequent absences, Ieyasu's sons, loyal retainers and vassals were able to control and improve Edo and the other new Tokugawa lands.\n In 1593, Toyotomi Hideyoshi fathered a son and heir, Toyotomi Hideyori.\n In 1598, with Hideyoshi's health clearly failing, Hideyoshi called a meeting that would determine the Council of Five Elders, who would be responsible for ruling on behalf of his son after his death. The five that were chosen as tair\u014d (regent) for Hideyori were Maeda Toshiie, M\u014dri Terumoto, Ukita Hideie, Uesugi Kagekatsu, and Ieyasu himself, who was the most powerful of the five. This change in the pre-Sekigahara power structure became pivotal as Ieyasu turned his attention towards Kansai; and at the same time, other ambitious (albeit ultimately unrealized) plans, such as the Tokugawa initiative establishing official relations with New Spain (modern-day Mexico), continued to unfold and advance.[20][21]\n Hideyoshi, after three more months of increasing sickness, died on September 18, 1598. He was nominally succeeded by his young son Hideyori but as he was just five years old, real power was in the hands of the regents. Over the next two years Ieyasu made alliances with various daimy\u014d, especially those who had no love for Hideyoshi. Happily for Ieyasu, the oldest and most respected of the regents, Maeda Toshiie, died after just one year.\n With the death of Hideyoshi in 1598 and Toshiie in 1599, Ieyasu led an army to Fushimi and took over Osaka Castle, the residence of Hideyori. This angered the three remaining regents and plans were made on all sides for war.[citation needed]\n Opposition to Ieyasu centered around Ishida Mitsunari, one of Hideyoshi's five bugy\u014d, or top administrators of Hideyoshi's government and a powerful daimy\u014d who was not one of the regents. Mitsunari plotted Ieyasu's death and news of this plot reached some of Ieyasu's generals. They attempted to kill Mitsunari but he fled and gained protection from none other than Ieyasu himself. It is not clear why Ieyasu protected a powerful enemy from his own men but Ieyasu was a master strategist and he may have concluded that he would be better off with Mitsunari leading the enemy army rather than one of the regents, who would have more legitimacy.[22]\n Nearly all of Japan's daimy\u014d and samurai now split into two factions\u2014The Western Army (Mitsunari's group) and The Eastern Army (anti-Mitsunari Group). Ieyasu supported the anti-Mitsunari Group, and formed them as his potential allies. Ieyasu's allies were Kat\u014d Kiyomasa, Fukushima Masanori, Date Masamune, the Kuroda clan, the Hosokawa clan and many daimy\u014d from eastern Japan. Mitsunari allied himself with the three other regents: Ukita Hideie, M\u014dri Terumoto, and Uesugi Kagekatsu as well as \u014ctani Yoshitsugu, Chosokabe clan, Shimazu clan and many daimy\u014d from the western end of Honsh\u016b.[citation needed]\n However, Uesugi Kagekatsu, one of Hideyoshi's appointed regents, defied Ieyasu by building up his military at Aizu. When Ieyasu officially condemned him and demanded that he come to Kyoto to explain himself, Kagekatsu's chief advisor, Naoe Kanetsugu responded with a counter-condemnation that mocked Ieyasu's abuses and violations of Hideyoshi's rules, and Ieyasu was infuriated.\n In July 1600, Ieyasu back to Edo, and his allies moved their armies to defeat the Uesugi clan, which was accused of planning to revolt against Toyotomi administration. In September 8, Ieyasu received information that Mitsunari captured Fushimi castle and his allies had moved their army against Ieyasu. Ieyasu held a meeting with the daimy\u014d, and they agreed to follow Ieyasu. \nLater in September 15, Mitsunari Western army arrives at Ogaki Castle. however, in September 29, Ieyasu's eastern army took Gifu castle. \nIn October 7, Ieyasu and his allies marched along the T\u014dkaid\u014d, while his son Hidetada went along through Nakasend\u014d with 38,000 soldiers (a battle against Sanada Masayuki in Shinano Province delayed Hidetada's forces, and they did not arrive in time for the main Battle of Sekigahara). In October 20, Ieyasu's Eastern army met Mitsunari's Western army at Sekigahara, and in the following morning, the battle began.\n Battle of Sekigahara fought near Sekigahara, was the biggest and one of the most important battles in Japanese feudal history. It began on October 21, 1600. Initially, the Eastern Army led by Tokugawa Ieyasu had 75,000 men, while the Western Army numbered 120,000 men under Ishida Mitsunari. Ieyasu had also sneaked in a supply of arquebuses. Knowing that the Tokugawa forces were heading towards Osaka, Mitsunari decided to abandon his positions and marched to Sekigahara. Even though the Western army had tremendous tactical advantages, Ieyasu had already been in contact with many of the daimy\u014d in the Western Army for months, promising them land and leniency after the battle should they switch sides, also having secretly communicated with  Hideyoshi nephew, Kobayakawa Hideaki. With a total of 170,000 soldiers facing each other, the Battle of Sekigahara ensued and ended with a complete Tokugawa victory.[23] Later, The Western bloc was crushed and over the next few days Ishida Mitsunari and many other western nobles were captured and killed. Tokugawa Ieyasu was now the de facto ruler of Japan.[citation needed]\n Immediately after the victory at Sekigahara, Ieyasu redistributed land to the vassals who had served him. Ieyasu left some western daimy\u014d unharmed, such as the Shimazu clan, but others were completely destroyed. Toyotomi Hideyori (the son of Hideyoshi) lost most of his territory which were under management of western daimy\u014d, and he was degraded to an ordinary daimy\u014d, not a ruler of Japan. In later years the vassals who had pledged allegiance to Ieyasu before Sekigahara became known as the fudai daimy\u014d, while those who pledged allegiance to him after the battle (in other words, after his power was unquestioned) were known as tozama daimy\u014d. Tozama daimy\u014d were considered inferior to fudai daimy\u014d.[citation needed]\n On March 24, 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu received the title of sh\u014dgun from Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei.[24] Ieyasu was 60 years old. He had outlasted all the other great men of his times: Nobunaga, Shingen, Hideyoshi, and Kenshin. As sh\u014dgun, he used his remaining years to create and solidify the Tokugawa shogunate, which ushered in the Edo period, and was the third shogunal government (after the Kamakura and the Ashikaga). He claimed descent from the Minamoto clan who had founded the Kamakura shogunate, by way of the Nitta clan. His descendants would marry into the Taira clan and the Fujiwara clan. The Tokugawa shogunate would rule Japan for the next 260 years.[1]\n Following a well established Japanese pattern, Ieyasu abdicated his official position as sh\u014dgun in 1605. His successor was his son and heir, Tokugawa Hidetada. There may have been several factors that contributed to his decision, including his desire to avoid being tied up in ceremonial duties, to make it harder for his enemies to attack the real power center, and to secure a smoother succession of his son.[25] The abdication of Ieyasu had no effect on the practical extent of his powers or his rule; but Hidetada nevertheless assumed a role as formal head of the shogunal bureaucracy.[citation needed]\n In 1605, Ieyasu, acting as the retired sh\u014dgun (\u5927\u5fa1\u6240, \u014dgosho), remained the effective ruler of Japan until his death. Ieyasu retired to Sunpu Castle in Sunpu, but he also supervised the building of Edo Castle, a massive construction project which lasted for the rest of Ieyasu's life. The result was the largest castle in all of Japan, the costs for building the castle being borne by all the other daimy\u014d, while Ieyasu reaped all the benefits. The central donjon, or tenshu, burned in the 1657 Meireki fire. Today, the Imperial Palace stands on the site of the castle.[citation needed]\n In 1611, Ieyasu, at the head of 50,000 men, visited Kyoto to witness the enthronement of Emperor Go-Mizunoo. In Kyoto, Ieyasu ordered the remodeling of the Imperial court and buildings, and forced the remaining western daimy\u014d to sign an oath of fealty to him.[citation needed]\n In 1613, he composed the Kuge shohatto (\u516c\u5bb6\u8af8\u6cd5\u5ea6), a document which put the court daimy\u014d under strict supervision, leaving them as mere ceremonial figureheads.[26]\n In 1615, Ieyasu prepared the Buke shohatto (\u6b66\u5bb6\u8af8\u6cd5\u5ea6), a document setting out the future of the Tokugawa regime.[27]\n As \u014cgosho, Ieyasu also supervised diplomatic affairs with the Netherlands, Spain, and England. Ieyasu chose to distance Japan from European influence starting in 1609, although the shogunate did still grant preferential trading rights to the Dutch East India Company and permitted them to maintain a \"factory\" for trading purposes.[citation needed]\n From 1605 until his death, Ieyasu frequently consulted English shipwright and pilot, William Adams.[28] Adams, fluent in Japanese, assisted the shogunate in negotiating trading relations, but was cited by members of the competing Jesuit and Spanish-sponsored mendicant orders as an obstacle to improved relations between Ieyasu and the Roman Catholic Church.[29][30][31]\n Significant attempts to curtail the influence of Christian missionaries in Japan date to 1587 during the shogunate of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. However, in 1614, Ieyasu was sufficiently concerned about Spanish territorial ambitions that he signed a Christian Expulsion Edict. The edict banned the practice of Christianity and led to the expulsion of all foreign missionaries. Although some smaller Dutch trading operations remained in Nagasaki, this edict dramatically curtailed foreign trade and marked the end of open Christian witness in Japan until the 1870s.[32] The immediate cause of the prohibition was the Okamoto Daihachi incident, a case of fraud involving Ieyasu's Catholic vavasor, but the shogunate was also concerned about a possible invasion by the Iberian colonial powers, which had previously occurred in the New World and the Philippines.[citation needed]\n The last remaining threat to Ieyasu's rule was Toyotomi Hideyori, the son and rightful heir to Hideyoshi.[1] He was now a young daimy\u014d living in Osaka Castle. Many samurai who opposed Ieyasu rallied around Hideyori, claiming that he was the rightful ruler of Japan. Ieyasu found fault with the opening ceremony of a temple built by Hideyori; it was as if he prayed for Ieyasu's death and the ruin of the Tokugawa clan. Ieyasu ordered Hideyori to leave Osaka Castle, but those in the castle refused and summoned samurai to gather within the castle. Then in 1614, Tokugawa besieged the Osaka Castle against Hideyori.\n The Tokugawa forces, with a huge army led by Ieyasu and sh\u014dgun Hidetada, laid Siege of Osaka castle in what is now known as \"the Winter Siege of Osaka\". Eventually, Tokugawa was able to precipitate negotiations and an armistice after directed cannon fire threatened Hideyori's mother, Yodo-dono. However, once the treaty was agreed, Tokugawa filled the castle's outer moats with sand so his troops could walk across. Through this ploy, Tokugawa gained a huge tract of land through negotiation and deception that he could not through siege and combat. Ieyasu returned to Sunpu Castle once, but after Toyotomi refused another order to leave Osaka, he and his allied army of 155,000 soldiers attacked Osaka Castle again in \"the Summer Siege of Osaka\".\n Finally, in late 1615, Osaka Castle fell and nearly all the defenders were killed, including Hideyori, his mother (Hideyoshi's widow, Yodo-dono), and his infant son. His wife, Senhime (a granddaughter of Ieyasu), pleaded to save Hideyori and Yodo-dono's lives. Ieyasu refused and either required them to commit ritual suicide, or killed both of them. Eventually, Senhime was sent back to Tokugawa alive. After killing two people at Kamakura, who have escaped from Osaka Castle. With the Toyotomi line finally extinguished, no threats remained to the Tokugawa clan's domination of Japan.\n In 1616, Ieyasu died at age 73.[8] The cause of death is thought to have been cancer or syphilis. The first Tokugawa sh\u014dgun was posthumously deified with the name T\u014dsh\u014d Daigongen (\u6771\u7167\u5927\u6b0a\u73fe), the \"Great Gongen, Light of the East\". (A Gongen is believed to be a buddha who has appeared on Earth in the shape of a kami to save sentient beings). In life, Ieyasu had expressed the wish to be deified after his death to protect his descendants from evil. His remains were buried at the Gongens' mausoleum at Kun\u014dzan, Kun\u014dzan T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b (\u4e45\u80fd\u5c71\u6771\u7167\u5bae). As a common view, many people believe that \"after the first anniversary of his death, his remains were reburied at Nikk\u014d Shrine, Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b (\u65e5\u5149\u6771\u7167\u5bae). His remains are still there.\" Neither shrine has offered to open the graves, so the location of Ieyasu's physical remains is still a mystery. The mausoleum's architectural style became known as gongen-zukuri, that is gongen-style.[33] He was first given the Buddhist name Tosho Dai-Gongen (\u6771\u7167\u5927\u6b0a\u73fe), then after his death it was changed to Hogo Onkokuin (\u6cd5\u865f\u5b89\u570b\u9662).[citation needed]\n Ieyasu ruled directly as sh\u014dgun or indirectly as \u014cgosho (\u5927\u5fa1\u6240) during the Keich\u014d era (1596\u20131615).\n Ieyasu had a number of qualities that enabled him to rise to power. He was both careful and bold\u2014at the right times, and in the right places. Calculating and subtle, Ieyasu switched alliances when he thought he would benefit from the change. He allied with the Late H\u014dj\u014d clan; then he joined Hideyoshi's army of conquest, which destroyed the H\u014dj\u014d; and he himself took over their lands. In this he was like other daimy\u014d of his time. This was an era of violence, sudden death, and betrayal. He was not very well liked nor personally popular, but he was feared and he was respected for his leadership and his cunning. For example, he wisely kept his soldiers out of Hideyoshi's campaign in Korea.[citation needed]\n He was capable of great loyalty: once he allied with Oda Nobunaga, he never went against him, and both leaders profited from their long alliance. He was known for being loyal towards his personal friends and vassals, whom he rewarded. He was said to have a close friendship with his vassal Hattori Hanz\u014d. However, he also remembered those who had wronged him in the past. It is said that Ieyasu executed a man who came into his power because he had insulted him when Ieyasu was young.[34]\n Ieyasu protected many former Takeda retainers from the wrath of Oda Nobunaga, who was known to harbour a bitter grudge towards the Takeda. He managed successfully to transform many of the retainers of the Takeda, H\u014dj\u014d, and Imagawa clans\u2014all whom he had defeated himself or helped to defeat\u2014into loyal followers.  At the same time, he could be ruthless when crossed. For example, he ordered the executions of his first wife and his eldest son\u2014a son-in-law of Oda Nobunaga; Oda was also an uncle of Hidetada's wife Oeyo.[35]\n He was cruel, relentless and merciless in the elimination of Toyotomi survivors after Osaka. For days, dozens and dozens of men and women were hunted down and executed, including an eight-year-old son of Hideyori by a concubine, who was beheaded.[36]\n Unlike Hideyoshi, he did not harbor any desires to conquer outside Japan\u2014he only wanted to bring order and an end to open warfare, and to rule Japan.[37]\n While at first tolerant of Christianity,[38] his attitude changed after 1613 and the executions of Christians sharply increased.[39]\n Ieyasu's favorite pastime was falconry. He regarded it as excellent training for a warrior. \"When you go into the country hawking, you learn to understand the military spirit and also the hard life of the lower classes. You exercise your muscles and train your limbs. You have any amount of walking and running and become quite indifferent to heat and cold, and so you are little likely to suffer from any illness.\".[40] Ieyasu swam often; even late in his life he is reported to have swum in the moat of Edo Castle.[citation needed]\n Later in life he took to scholarship and religion, patronizing scholars like Hayashi Razan.[41]\n Two of his famous quotes:\n Life is like unto a long journey with a heavy burden. Let thy step be slow and steady, that thou stumble not. Persuade thyself that imperfection and inconvenience are the lot of natural mortals, and there will be no room for discontent, neither for despair. When ambitious desires arise in thy heart, recall the days of extremity thou hast passed through. Forbearance is the root of all quietness and assurance forever. Look upon the wrath of thy enemy. If thou only knowest what it is to conquer, and knowest not what it is to be defeated; woe unto thee, it will fare ill with thee. Find fault with thyself rather than with others.[42] The strong manly ones in life are those who understand the meaning of the word patience. Patience means restraining one's inclinations. There are seven emotions: joy, anger, anxiety, adoration, grief, fear, and hate, and if a man does not give way to these he can be called patient. I am not as strong as I might be, but I have long known and practiced patience. And if my descendants wish to be as I am, they must study patience.[43][44] He said that he fought, as a warrior or a general, in 90 battles.[citation needed]\n He was interested in various kenjutsu skills, was a patron of the Yagy\u016b Shinkage-ry\u016b school, and also had them as his personal sword instructors.[citation needed]\n Matsudaira Yorizumi (1641\u20131711) of Saij\u014d DomainInabahime (1631\u20131709) married Ikeda Mitsunaka (1630\u20131693) of Tottori DomainMatsuhime married Matsudaira Nobuhira (1636\u20131689) of Takatsukasa-Matsudaira Clan\n Nabeshima Naohiro (1618\u20131661) of Shiroishi-Nabeshima clandaughter married Kakomi TsunatoshiNabeshima Naotomo (1622\u20131709) of Kashima DomainPriest Ky\u014dk\u014ddaughter married Nabeshima NaohiroKakomi Naonaga\n In James Clavell's historical-novel Sh\u014dgun, Tokugawa served as basis for the character of \"Toranaga\". Toranaga was portrayed by Toshiro Mifune in the 1980 TV mini-series adaptation.\n Hyouge Mono (\u3078\u3046\u3052\u3082\u306e) is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Yamada. It was adapted into an anime series in 2011, and includes a fictional depiction of Tokugawa's life.\n In Sengoku Basara game and anime series, he was shown with Honda Tadakatsu. In earlier games, he was armed with spears and led countless warriors, in later ones, he discards the spear and fights with his fists (similar to Boxing fighting style) and wants Japan united under the force of bonds.\n Tokugawa is the leader of Japan in Sid Meier's Civilization IV. He is an aggressive and organized leader with an emphasis on mercantilism.\n In the 2021 Netflix documentary series Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan, Ieyasu is prominently portrayed by Hayate Masao. The show depicts his life and rise to power.\n Ieyasu features as a character in Ik\u00e9men Sengoku, a dating simulator otome game released by Cybird in 2015.\n Among the many conspiracies surrounding the Honn\u014d-ji Incident is Ieyasu's role in the event. Historically, Ieyasu was away from his lord at the time and, when he heard that Nobunaga was in danger, he wanted to rush to his lord's rescue in spite of the small number of attendants with him. However, Tadakatsu advised for his lord to avoid the risk and urged for a quick retreat to Mikawa. Masanari led the way through Iga and they returned home by boat.\n However, skeptics think otherwise. While they usually accept the historically known facts about Ieyasu's actions during Mitsuhide's betrayal, theorists tend to pay more attention to the events before. Ever since Ieyasu lost his wife and son due to Nobunaga's orders, they reason, he held a secret resentment against his lord. Generally, there is some belief that he privately goaded Mitsuhide to take action when the two warlords were together in Azuchi Castle. Together, they planned when to attack and went their separate ways. When the deed was done, Ieyasu turned a blind eye to Mitsuhide's schemes and fled the scene to feign innocence. A variation of the concept states that Ieyasu was well aware of Mitsuhide's feelings regarding Nobunaga and simply chose to do nothing for his own benefit.\n Minamoto-no-Ieyasu was born in Tenbun 11, on the 26th day of the 12th month (1542) and he died in Genna 2, on the 17th day of the 4th month (1616); and thus, his contemporaries would have said that he lived 75 years. In this period, children were considered one year old at birth and became two the following New Year's Day; and all people advanced a year that day, not on their actual birthday.

Ieyasu's father, Matsudaira Hirotada, was a minor local warlord based at Okazaki Castle who controlled a portion of the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway linking Kyoto with the eastern provinces. His territory was sandwiched between stronger and predatory neighbors, including the Imagawa clan based in Suruga Province to the east and the Oda clan to the west. Hirotada's main enemy was Oda Nobuhide, the father of Oda Nobunaga.[5]\n\nEarly life (1542\u20131556)[edit]\n Okazaki Castle, the birthplace of Tokugawa Ieyasu\nTokugawa Ieyasu was born in Okazaki Castle on the 26th day of the twelfth month of the eleventh year of Tenbun, according to the Japanese calendar. Originally named Matsudaira Takechiyo (\u677e\u5e73 \u7af9\u5343\u4ee3), he was the son of Matsudaira Hirotada (\u677e\u5e73 \u5ee3\u5fe0), the daimy\u014d of Mikawa of the Matsudaira clan, and Odai no Kata (\u65bc\u5927\u306e\u65b9, Lady Odai), the daughter of a neighbouring samurai lord, Mizuno Tadamasa (\u6c34\u91ce \u5fe0\u653f). His mother and father were step-siblings. They were just 17 and 15 years old, respectively, when Ieyasu was born.[6]\nIn the year of Ieyasu's birth, the Matsudaira clan was split. In 1543, Hirotada's uncle, Matsudaira Nobutaka defected to the Oda clan. This gave Oda Nobuhide the confidence to attack Okazaki. Soon afterwards, Hirotada's father-in-law died, and his son Mizuno Nobumoto revived the clan's traditional enmity against the Matsudaira and declared for Oda Nobuhide as well. As a result, Hirotada divorced Odai-no-kata and sent her back to her family.[5] Hirotada later remarried to different wives, and Ieyasu eventually had 11 half-brothers and sisters.[6]\nAs Oda Nobuhide continued to attack Okazaki, Hirotada turned to his powerful eastern neighbour, Imagawa Yoshimoto for assistance. Yoshimoto agreed to an alliance under the condition that Hirotada send his young heir to Sunpu Domain as a hostage.[5]\nOda Nobuhide learned of this arrangement and had Ieyasu abducted and taken to Sunpu.[7] Ieyasu was just five years old at the time.[8]\nNobuhide threatened to execute Ieyasu unless his father severed all ties with the Imagawa clan. However, Hirotada refused, stating that sacrificing his own son would show his seriousness in his pact with the Imagawa. Despite this refusal, Nobuhide chose not to kill Ieyasu, but instead held him as a hostage for the next three years at the Honsh\u014dji temple in Nagoya (It is said that Oda Nobunaga met Ieyasu at this place, since Ieyasu was 6 years old, and Nobunaga was 14 at that time.)\nIn 1549, when Ieyasu was 6,[8] his father Hirotada was murdered by his own vassals, who had been bribed by the Oda clan. At about the same time, Oda Nobuhide died during an epidemic. Nobuhide's death dealt a heavy blow to the Oda clan.\nIn 1551, an army under the command of Imagawa Sessai laid siege to the castle where Oda Nobuhiro, Nobuhide's eldest son, was living. Nobuhiro was trapped by the Imagawa clan, but was saved by Oda Nobunaga, Nobuhide's second son, through negotiations. Sessai made an agreement with Nobunaga to take Ieyasu back to Imagawa, and he agreed. So Ieyasu (now nine years old) was taken as a hostage to Sunpu. At Sunpu, he remained a hostage, but was treated fairly well as a potentially useful future ally of the Imagawa clan until 1556 when he was 14 years old.[8]\n\nService under Yoshimoto (1556\u20131560)[edit]\nIn 1556, Ieyasu officially came of age, with Imagawa Yoshimoto presiding over his genpuku ceremony. Following tradition, he changed his name from Matsudaira Takechiyo to Matsudaira Jir\u014dsabur\u014d Motonobu (\u677e\u5e73 \u6b21\u90ce\u4e09\u90ce \u5143\u4fe1). He was also briefly allowed to visit Okazaki to pay his respects to the tomb of his father, and receive the homage of his nominal retainers, led by the kar\u014d Torii Tadayoshi.[5]\nOne year later, at the age of 15 (according to East Asian age reckoning), he married his first wife, Lady Tsukiyama, a relative of Imagawa Yoshimoto, and changed his name again to Matsudaira Kurandonosuke Motoyasu (\u677e\u5e73 \u8535\u4eba\u4f50 \u5143\u5eb7). A year later, their son, Matsudaira Nobuyasu, was born. He was then allowed to return to Mikawa Province. There, the Imagawa then ordered him to fight the Oda clan in a series of battles.[citation needed]\nMotoyasu fought his first battle in 1558 at the Siege of Terabe. The lord of Terabe, Suzuki Shigeteru, betrayed the Imagawa by defecting to Oda Nobunaga. This was nominally within Matsudaira territory, so Imagawa Yoshimoto entrusted the campaign to Ieyasu and his retainers from Okazaki. Ieyasu led the attack in person, but after taking the outer defences, he burned the main castle and withdrew. As anticipated, the Oda forces attacked his rear lines, but Motoyasu was prepared and drove off the Oda army.[9]\nHe then succeeded in delivering supplies in the Siege of Odaka a year later. Odaka was the only one of five disputed frontier forts under attack by the Oda which remained in Imagawa hands. Motoyasu launched diversionary attacks against the two neighboring forts, and when the garrisons of the other forts went to their assistance, Ieyasu's supply column was able to reach Odaka.[10]\n\nDeath of Yoshimoto[edit]\nMain articles: Siege of Marune and Battle of Okehazama\nBy 1559 the leadership of the Oda clan had passed to Oda Nobunaga. In 1560, Imagawa Yoshimoto leading a large army of 25,000 men, invaded Oda clan territory. Motoyasu was assigned a separate mission to capture the stronghold of Marune. As a result, he and his men were not present at the Battle of Okehazama where Yoshimoto was killed in Nobunaga's surprise assault.[7]:37\n\nEarly Rise (1560\u20131570)[edit]\n Ukiyo-e of Tokugawa Ieyasu\nAlliance with Nobunaga[edit]\nMain article: Siege of Kaminogo Castle\nWith Yoshimoto dead, and the Imagawa clan in a state of confusion, Motoyasu used the opportunity to assert his independence and marched his men back into the abandoned Okazaki Castle and reclaimed his ancestral seat.[9]\nMotoyasu then decided to ally with Oda Nobunaga.[11]\nA secret deal was needed because Motoyasu's wife, Lady Tsukiyama, and infant son, Nobuyasu, were held hostage in Sumpu by Imagawa Ujizane, Yoshimoto's heir.[citation needed]\nIn 1561, Motoyasu openly broke with the Imagawa and captured the fortress of Kaminog\u014d. Kaminog\u014d was held by Udono Nagamochi. Resorting to stealth, Motoyasu forces under Hattori Hanz\u014d attacked under cover of darkness, setting fire to the castle, and capturing two of Udono's sons, whom he used as hostages to exchange for his wife and son.[10]:216\nIn 1563, Nobuyasu, the first son of Motoyasu, was married to Nobunaga's daughter Tokuhime. In the same year in February, Motoyasu changed his name to Ieyasu.[12][13]\nFor the next few years Ieyasu was occupied with reforming the Matsudaira clan and pacifying Mikawa. He also strengthened his key vassals by awarding them land and castles. These vassals included \u014ckubo Tadayo, Ishikawa Kazumasa, K\u014driki Kiyonaga, Sakai Tadatsugu, Honda Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa and Hattori Hanz\u014d.[citation needed]\nDuring this period, the Matsudaira clan also faced a threat from a different source. Mikawa was a major center for the Ikk\u014d-ikki movement, where peasants banded together with militant monks under the J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b sect, and rejected the traditional feudal social order. Ieyasu undertook several battles to suppress this movement in his territories, including the Battle of Azukizaka (1564).[10]:216\n\nBattle of Batogahara[edit]\nMain article: Battle of Azukizaka (1564)\n An ukiyo-e print depicting the Battle of Batogahara. In his early days as daimy\u014d of Mikawa, Ieyasu had difficult relations with the J\u014dd\u014d temples which escalated in 1563\u201364.\nOn January 15, 1564, Ieyasu had decided to concentrate his forces to attack and eliminating the Ikki from Mikawa. In the Ikki ranks were some of Ieyasu's vassals, like Honda Masanobu and Natsume Yoshinobu, who had turned over to the Ikki rebellion on religious sympathy.\nIeyasu was fighting in the front line and was nearly killed when struck by several bullets which did not penetrate his armour. Both sides were using the new gunpowder weapons which the Portuguese had introduced to Japan just 20 years earlier. Ieyasu's brave conduct in the battle convinced many of the samurai in the Ikki to switch sides and the Ikki were defeated.[citation needed]\n\nTokugawa clan[edit]\nMain article: Tokugawa clan\nIn 1565, Matsudaira Ieyasu became master of all of Mikawa Province. In 1567 Ieyasu changed his name yet again and started the family name \"Tokugawa\", this time to Tokugawa Ieyasu. As he was a member of the Matsudaira clan, he claimed descent from the Seiwa Genji branch of the Minamoto clan. However, there was no proof the Matsudaira clan are descendants of Emperor Seiwa.[14] Yet, his surname was changed with the permission of the Imperial Court, after writing a petition, and he was bestowed the courtesy title \"Mikawa-no-kami\" and the court rank of \"Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (\u5f9e\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b, ju go-i no ge)\". Though the Tokugawa could claim some modicum of freedom, they were very much subject to the requests of Oda Nobunaga. Ieyasu remained an ally of Nobunaga and his Mikawa soldiers were part of Nobunaga's army which captured Kyoto in 1568. At the same time, Ieyasu was eager to expand eastward to T\u014dt\u014dmi province. Ieyasu and Takeda Shingen, the head of the Takeda clan in Kai Province, made an alliance for the purpose of conquering all the Imagawa territory.[15]:279\n\nT\u014dt\u014dmi campaign[edit]\nMain article: Siege of Kakegawa\nIn 1569, Ieyasu's troops penetrated into T\u014dt\u014dmi Province. Meanwhile, Shingen's troops captured Suruga Province (including the Imagawa capital of Sunpu). Imagawa Ujizane fled to Kakegawa Castle, which lead to Ieyasu to lead the Siege of Kakegawa. Ieyasu then negotiated with Ujizane, promising that if he should surrender himself and the remainder of T\u014dt\u014dmi, he would assist Ujizane in regaining Suruga. Ujizane had nothing left to lose, and Ieyasu immediately ended his alliance with Takeda, instead making a new alliance with Takeda's enemy to the north, Uesugi Kenshin of the Uesugi clan. Through these political manipulations, Ieyasu gained the support of the samurai of T\u014dt\u014dmi Province.[9]\nIn 1570, Ieyasu established Hamamatsu as the capital of his territory, placing his son Nobuyasu in charge of Okazaki.[16]\n\nIeyasu and Nobunaga (1570-1582)[edit]\nBattle of Anegawa[edit]\nMain article: Battle of Anegawa\nIn 1570, Asai Nagamasa, brother in law of Oda Nobunaga, during Siege of Kanegasaki broke their alliance with the Oda clans. Soon Nobunaga was ready to punish Nagamasa for his treachery. Ieyasu led 5,000 of his men to support Nobunaga at the battle.[7]:62\nThe Battle of Anegawa occurred near Lake Biwa in \u014cmi Province, Japan. The allied forces of Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu defeated the combined forces of the Azai clans and Asakura clans, and saw Nobunaga's prodigious use of firearms. It is notable as the first battle that involved the alliance between Nobunaga and Ieyasu.\n\nConflict with Takeda[edit]\nMain articles: Battle of Mikatagahara, Battle of Nagashino, and Battle of Tenmokuzan\nIn October 1571, Takeda Shingen broke the alliance with Oda-Tokugawa clan and now allied with the Odawara H\u014dj\u014d clan. He decided to make a drive for Kyoto at the urgings of the sh\u014dgun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, starting with invading Tokugawa lands in T\u014dt\u014dmi. Takeda Shingen's first objective in his campaign against Ieyasu was Nishikawa Castle, Yoshida Castle and Futamata Castle. In 1572, after besieging Futamata, Shingen would press on past Futamata towards the major Tokugawa home castle at Hamamatsu. Later, Ieyasu asked for help from Nobunaga, who sent him some 3,000 troops. Early in 1573 the two armies met at the Battle of Mikatagahara, north Hamamatsu. The considerably larger Takeda army, under the expert direction of Shingen, overwhelmed Ieyasu's troops and caused heavy casualties. Despite his initial reluctance, Ieyasu was convinced by his generals to retreat.[17][16] The battle was a major defeat, but in the interests of maintaining the appearance of dignified withdrawal, Ieyasu brazenly ordered the men at his castle to light torches, sound drums, and leave the gates open, to properly receive the returning warriors. To the surprise and relief of the Tokugawa army, this spectacle made the Takeda generals suspicious of being led into a trap, so they did not besiege the castle and instead made camp for the night.[17] This error would allow a band of Tokugawa soldiers to raid the camp in the ensuing hours, further upsetting the already disoriented Takeda army, and ultimately resulting in Shingen's decision to call off the offensive altogether. Takeda Shingen would not get another chance to advance on Hamamatsu, much less Kyoto, since he would perish shortly after the Siege of Noda Castle later that same year.[11]:153\u2013156\nShingen was succeeded by his less capable son Takeda Katsuyori. In 1574, Katsuyori took Takatenjin fortress. Then, in 1575, during Takeda Katsuyori's raid through Mikawa Province, he attacked Yoshida castle and besieged Nagashino castle in Mikawa Province. Ieyasu appealed to Nobunaga for help and Nobunaga came personally with 30,000 strong men. The Oda-Tokugawa forces of 38,000 won a great victory and successfully defended Nagashino castle. Though the Takeda forces had been destroyed, Katsuyori survived the battle and retreated back to Kai Province.[18] \nFor the next seven years, Ieyasu and Katsuyori fought a series of small battles, as the result of which Ieyasu's troops managed to wrest control of Suruga Province away from the Takeda clan.\nIn 1579, Lady Tsukiyama, Ieyasu' wife, and his heir Nobuyasu, were accused by Nobunaga of conspiring with Takeda Katsuyori to assassinate Nobunaga, whose daughter Tokuhime was married to Nobuyasu. For this reason, Ieyasu ordered his wife to be executed and forced his son to commit seppuku. Ieyasu then named his third son, Tokugawa Hidetada, as heir, since his second son had been adopted by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who would later become an extremely powerful daimyo.[citation needed]\nIn 1580, Oda-Tokugawa forces launched the second siege of Takatenjin; the siege came only six years after Takeda Katsuyori had taken the fortress. This second siege lasted from 1580 until 22 March 1581, and ended with the deaths of 680 men in the Okabe Motonobu garrison.\nThe end of the war with Takeda came in 1582 when a combined Oda-Tokugawa force attacked and conquered Kai Province. Takeda Katsuyori was defeated at the Battle of Tenmokuzan, and then committed seppuku.[10]:231\n\nDeath of Nobunaga[edit]\nMain article: Honn\u014d-ji Incident\nIn late June 1582, before the incident at Honn\u014d-ji temple, Nobunaga invited Ieyasu to tour the Kansai region in celebration of the demise of the Takeda clan. When he learned that Nobunaga had been killed at the Honn\u014d-ji temple by Akechi Mitsuhide, this meant that some provinces, ruled by Nobunaga's vassals, were ripe for conquest. Later, Ieyasu traveled back to Mikawa for gathering his forces. With the help of his retainer and ninja leader Hattori Hanz\u014d, Ieyasu first went through Sakai, then crossed the mountains of Iga Province, finally reaching the shore in Ise Province. He returned to his home Mikawa Province by sea. Ieyasu was mobilizing his army when he learned Hideyoshi had defeated Akechi Mitsuhide at the Battle of Yamazaki.[15]:314\u2013315\n\nIeyasu and Hideyoshi (1582\u20131598)[edit]\nAfter the death of Nobunaga at Honn\u014d-ji castle, the leader of Kai province made the mistake of killing one of Ieyasu's aides. Because of this, Ieyasu promptly invaded Kai and took control. H\u014dj\u014d Ujimasa, leader of the H\u014dj\u014d clan responded by sending his much larger army into Shinano and then into Kai province. Later, both Ieyasu and the H\u014dj\u014d clan agreed to a settlement which left Ieyasu in control of both Kai and Shinano Provinces, while the H\u014dj\u014d took control of Kazusa Province (as well as bits of both Kai and Shinano Provinces).[citation needed]\nIn 1583, a war for rule over Japan was fought between Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Shibata Katsuie. Ieyasu did not take a side in this conflict, building on his reputation for both caution and wisdom. Hideyoshi defeated Katsuie at Battle of Shizugatake. With this victory, Hideyoshi became the single most powerful daimy\u014d in Japan.[15]:314\n\nConflict with Hideyoshi[edit]\nMain article: Battle of Komaki and Nagakute\nIn 1584, Ieyasu decided to support Oda Nobukatsu, the eldest surviving son and heir of Oda Nobunaga, against Hideyoshi. This was a dangerous act and could have resulted in the annihilation of the Tokugawa, due to the fact that the Oda clan collapsed after Nobunaga's death.[citation needed]\nTokugawa troops took the traditional Oda stronghold of Owari. Hideyoshi responded by sending an army into Owari. The Komaki and Nagakute Campaign was the only time any of the great unifiers of Japan fought each other.\nThe Komaki and Nagakute campaign proved indecisive and after months of fruitless marches and feints, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu settled the war through negotiation. First, Hideyoshi made peace with Oda Nobukatsu, and then he offered a truce to Ieyasu. The deal was made at the end of the year; as part of the terms Ieyasu's second son, Ogimaru (also known as Yuki Hideyasu) became an adopted son of Hideyoshi.[citation needed]\nIeyasu's aide, Ishikawa Kazumasa, chose to join the pre-eminent daimy\u014d and so he moved to Osaka to be with Hideyoshi. However, few other Tokugawa retainers followed this example.[citation needed]\n\nAlliance with Hideyoshi[edit]\nMain articles: Siege of Odawara (1590) and Kunohe Rebellion\nHideyoshi was understandably distrustful of Ieyasu, and five years passed before they fought as allies. The Tokugawa did not participate in Hideyoshi's successful Invasion of Shikoku (1585) and Ky\u016bsh\u016b Campaign (1587).[citation needed]\nIn 1590, Hideyoshi attacked the last independent daimy\u014d in Japan, H\u014dj\u014d Ujimasa. The H\u014dj\u014d clan ruled the eight provinces of the Kant\u014d region in eastern Japan. Hideyoshi ordered them to submit to his authority and they refused. Ieyasu, though a friend and occasional ally of Ujimasa, joined his large force of 30,000 samurai with Hideyoshi's enormous army of some 160,000. Odawara Campaign is the first battle of Ieyasu and Hideyoshi as allies. They attacked several castles on the borders of the H\u014dj\u014d clan with most of his army laying siege to the castle at Odawara. Hideyoshi's and Ieyasu's army captured Odawara after six months (oddly for the time period, deaths on both sides were few). During this siege, Hideyoshi offered Ieyasu a radical deal: He offered Ieyasu the eight Kant\u014d provinces which they were about to take from the H\u014dj\u014d in return for the five provinces that Ieyasu currently controlled (including Ieyasu's home province of Mikawa). Ieyasu accepted this proposal. Bowing to the overwhelming power of the Toyotomi army, the H\u014dj\u014d accepted defeat, their leaders committed suicide and Ieyasu marched in and took control of their provinces, ending the clan's reign of over 100 years.[citation needed]\nThe Sannohe faction led by Nanbu Nobunao organized a coalition of most of the Nanbu clans and pledged allegiance to Toyotomi Hideyoshi at the Siege of Odawara. In return, he was recognized as chieftain of the Nanbu clans, and confirmed as daimy\u014d of his existing holdings in the northern districts of Mutsu Province. However, Kunohe Masazane, who felt that he had a stronger claim to the title of clan chieftain, immediately rose in rebellion.\nIn 1591, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu took the Kunohe Rebellion as a personal affront to Toyotomi authority and by mid-year organized a retaliatory army to retake northern T\u014dhoku and to restore the area to Nanbu Nobunao's control.\n\nRise to Power (1591\u20131598)[edit]\nDaimy\u014d of Kant\u014d region[edit]\nMain article: Kant\u014d region\nIeyasu now gave up control of his five provinces (Mikawa, T\u014dt\u014dmi, Suruga, Shinano, and Kai) and moved all his soldiers and vassals to the Kant\u014d region. He himself occupied the castle town of Edo in Kant\u014d. This was possibly the riskiest move Ieyasu ever made\u2014to leave his home province and rely on the uncertain loyalty of the formerly H\u014dj\u014d samurai in Kant\u014d. In the end, it worked out brilliantly for Ieyasu. He reformed the Kant\u014d region, controlled and pacified the H\u014dj\u014d samurai and improved the underlying economic infrastructure of the lands. Also, because Kant\u014d was somewhat isolated from the rest of Japan, Ieyasu was able to maintain a unique level of autonomy from Hideyoshi's rule. Within a few years, Ieyasu had become the second most powerful daimy\u014d in Japan. There is a Japanese proverb which likely refers to this event: \"Ieyasu won the Empire by retreating.\"[19]\n\nCouncil of Five Elders[edit]\nMain article: Council of Five Elders\nIn 1592, Hideyoshi invaded Korea as a prelude to his plan to attack China. The Tokugawa samurai never actually took part in this campaign, though in early 1593, Ieyasu himself was summoned to Hideyoshi's court in Nagoya (in Ky\u016bsh\u016b, different from the similarly spelled city in Owari Province) as a military advisor and given command of a body of troops meant as reserves for the Korean campaign. He stayed in Nagoya off and on for the next five years.[15] Despite his frequent absences, Ieyasu's sons, loyal retainers and vassals were able to control and improve Edo and the other new Tokugawa lands.\nIn 1593, Toyotomi Hideyoshi fathered a son and heir, Toyotomi Hideyori.\nIn 1598, with Hideyoshi's health clearly failing, Hideyoshi called a meeting that would determine the Council of Five Elders, who would be responsible for ruling on behalf of his son after his death. The five that were chosen as tair\u014d (regent) for Hideyori were Maeda Toshiie, M\u014dri Terumoto, Ukita Hideie, Uesugi Kagekatsu, and Ieyasu himself, who was the most powerful of the five. This change in the pre-Sekigahara power structure became pivotal as Ieyasu turned his attention towards Kansai; and at the same time, other ambitious (albeit ultimately unrealized) plans, such as the Tokugawa initiative establishing official relations with New Spain (modern-day Mexico), continued to unfold and advance.[20][21]\n\nDeath of Hideyoshi[edit]\nHideyoshi, after three more months of increasing sickness, died on September 18, 1598. He was nominally succeeded by his young son Hideyori but as he was just five years old, real power was in the hands of the regents. Over the next two years Ieyasu made alliances with various daimy\u014d, especially those who had no love for Hideyoshi. Happily for Ieyasu, the oldest and most respected of the regents, Maeda Toshiie, died after just one year.\n\nUnification of Japan (1598\u20131603)[edit]\n The kabuto (helmet) of Tokugawa Ieyasu.\nConflict with Mitsunari[edit]\nMain articles: Siege of Shiroishi, Siege of Hased\u014d, Battle of Gifu Castle, Siege of Fushimi, and Siege of Ueda\nWith the death of Hideyoshi in 1598 and Toshiie in 1599, Ieyasu led an army to Fushimi and took over Osaka Castle, the residence of Hideyori. This angered the three remaining regents and plans were made on all sides for war.[citation needed]\nOpposition to Ieyasu centered around Ishida Mitsunari, one of Hideyoshi's five bugy\u014d, or top administrators of Hideyoshi's government and a powerful daimy\u014d who was not one of the regents. Mitsunari plotted Ieyasu's death and news of this plot reached some of Ieyasu's generals. They attempted to kill Mitsunari but he fled and gained protection from none other than Ieyasu himself. It is not clear why Ieyasu protected a powerful enemy from his own men but Ieyasu was a master strategist and he may have concluded that he would be better off with Mitsunari leading the enemy army rather than one of the regents, who would have more legitimacy.[22]\nNearly all of Japan's daimy\u014d and samurai now split into two factions\u2014The Western Army (Mitsunari's group) and The Eastern Army (anti-Mitsunari Group). Ieyasu supported the anti-Mitsunari Group, and formed them as his potential allies. Ieyasu's allies were Kat\u014d Kiyomasa, Fukushima Masanori, Date Masamune, the Kuroda clan, the Hosokawa clan and many daimy\u014d from eastern Japan. Mitsunari allied himself with the three other regents: Ukita Hideie, M\u014dri Terumoto, and Uesugi Kagekatsu as well as \u014ctani Yoshitsugu, Chosokabe clan, Shimazu clan and many daimy\u014d from the western end of Honsh\u016b.[citation needed]\nHowever, Uesugi Kagekatsu, one of Hideyoshi's appointed regents, defied Ieyasu by building up his military at Aizu. When Ieyasu officially condemned him and demanded that he come to Kyoto to explain himself, Kagekatsu's chief advisor, Naoe Kanetsugu responded with a counter-condemnation that mocked Ieyasu's abuses and violations of Hideyoshi's rules, and Ieyasu was infuriated.\nIn July 1600, Ieyasu back to Edo, and his allies moved their armies to defeat the Uesugi clan, which was accused of planning to revolt against Toyotomi administration. In September 8, Ieyasu received information that Mitsunari captured Fushimi castle and his allies had moved their army against Ieyasu. Ieyasu held a meeting with the daimy\u014d, and they agreed to follow Ieyasu. \nLater in September 15, Mitsunari Western army arrives at Ogaki Castle. however, in September 29, Ieyasu's eastern army took Gifu castle. \nIn October 7, Ieyasu and his allies marched along the T\u014dkaid\u014d, while his son Hidetada went along through Nakasend\u014d with 38,000 soldiers (a battle against Sanada Masayuki in Shinano Province delayed Hidetada's forces, and they did not arrive in time for the main Battle of Sekigahara). In October 20, Ieyasu's Eastern army met Mitsunari's Western army at Sekigahara, and in the following morning, the battle began.\n\nBattle of Sekigahara[edit]\nMain article: Battle of Sekigahara\nBattle of Sekigahara fought near Sekigahara, was the biggest and one of the most important battles in Japanese feudal history. It began on October 21, 1600. Initially, the Eastern Army led by Tokugawa Ieyasu had 75,000 men, while the Western Army numbered 120,000 men under Ishida Mitsunari. Ieyasu had also sneaked in a supply of arquebuses. Knowing that the Tokugawa forces were heading towards Osaka, Mitsunari decided to abandon his positions and marched to Sekigahara. Even though the Western army had tremendous tactical advantages, Ieyasu had already been in contact with many of the daimy\u014d in the Western Army for months, promising them land and leniency after the battle should they switch sides, also having secretly communicated with  Hideyoshi nephew, Kobayakawa Hideaki. With a total of 170,000 soldiers facing each other, the Battle of Sekigahara ensued and ended with a complete Tokugawa victory.[23] Later, The Western bloc was crushed and over the next few days Ishida Mitsunari and many other western nobles were captured and killed. Tokugawa Ieyasu was now the de facto ruler of Japan.[citation needed]\n\n Armor of Tokugawa Ieyasu at Kun\u014dzan T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b\nImmediately after the victory at Sekigahara, Ieyasu redistributed land to the vassals who had served him. Ieyasu left some western daimy\u014d unharmed, such as the Shimazu clan, but others were completely destroyed. Toyotomi Hideyori (the son of Hideyoshi) lost most of his territory which were under management of western daimy\u014d, and he was degraded to an ordinary daimy\u014d, not a ruler of Japan. In later years the vassals who had pledged allegiance to Ieyasu before Sekigahara became known as the fudai daimy\u014d, while those who pledged allegiance to him after the battle (in other words, after his power was unquestioned) were known as tozama daimy\u014d. Tozama daimy\u014d were considered inferior to fudai daimy\u014d.[citation needed]\n\nSh\u014dgun (1603\u20131605)[edit]\nMain article: Tokugawa shogunate\n Tokugawa Ieyasu as sh\u014dgun\nOn March 24, 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu received the title of sh\u014dgun from Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei.[24] Ieyasu was 60 years old. He had outlasted all the other great men of his times: Nobunaga, Shingen, Hideyoshi, and Kenshin. As sh\u014dgun, he used his remaining years to create and solidify the Tokugawa shogunate, which ushered in the Edo period, and was the third shogunal government (after the Kamakura and the Ashikaga). He claimed descent from the Minamoto clan who had founded the Kamakura shogunate, by way of the Nitta clan. His descendants would marry into the Taira clan and the Fujiwara clan. The Tokugawa shogunate would rule Japan for the next 260 years.[1]\nFollowing a well established Japanese pattern, Ieyasu abdicated his official position as sh\u014dgun in 1605. His successor was his son and heir, Tokugawa Hidetada. There may have been several factors that contributed to his decision, including his desire to avoid being tied up in ceremonial duties, to make it harder for his enemies to attack the real power center, and to secure a smoother succession of his son.[25] The abdication of Ieyasu had no effect on the practical extent of his powers or his rule; but Hidetada nevertheless assumed a role as formal head of the shogunal bureaucracy.[citation needed]\n\n\u014cgosho (1605\u20131616)[edit]\n Edo Castle from a 17th-century painting\nConstruction of Edo castle[edit]\nMain article: Edo Castle\nIn 1605, Ieyasu, acting as the retired sh\u014dgun (\u5927\u5fa1\u6240, \u014dgosho), remained the effective ruler of Japan until his death. Ieyasu retired to Sunpu Castle in Sunpu, but he also supervised the building of Edo Castle, a massive construction project which lasted for the rest of Ieyasu's life. The result was the largest castle in all of Japan, the costs for building the castle being borne by all the other daimy\u014d, while Ieyasu reaped all the benefits. The central donjon, or tenshu, burned in the 1657 Meireki fire. Today, the Imperial Palace stands on the site of the castle.[citation needed]\nIn 1611, Ieyasu, at the head of 50,000 men, visited Kyoto to witness the enthronement of Emperor Go-Mizunoo. In Kyoto, Ieyasu ordered the remodeling of the Imperial court and buildings, and forced the remaining western daimy\u014d to sign an oath of fealty to him.[citation needed]\nIn 1613, he composed the Kuge shohatto (\u516c\u5bb6\u8af8\u6cd5\u5ea6), a document which put the court daimy\u014d under strict supervision, leaving them as mere ceremonial figureheads.[26]\nIn 1615, Ieyasu prepared the Buke shohatto (\u6b66\u5bb6\u8af8\u6cd5\u5ea6), a document setting out the future of the Tokugawa regime.[27]\n\nRelations with foreign powers[edit]\nMain article: History of Roman Catholicism in Japan\n William Adams before Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu\n Letter from King James VI and I of England to Ogosho Ieyasu in 1613\nAs \u014cgosho, Ieyasu also supervised diplomatic affairs with the Netherlands, Spain, and England. Ieyasu chose to distance Japan from European influence starting in 1609, although the shogunate did still grant preferential trading rights to the Dutch East India Company and permitted them to maintain a \"factory\" for trading purposes.[citation needed]\nFrom 1605 until his death, Ieyasu frequently consulted English shipwright and pilot, William Adams.[28] Adams, fluent in Japanese, assisted the shogunate in negotiating trading relations, but was cited by members of the competing Jesuit and Spanish-sponsored mendicant orders as an obstacle to improved relations between Ieyasu and the Roman Catholic Church.[29][30][31]\nSignificant attempts to curtail the influence of Christian missionaries in Japan date to 1587 during the shogunate of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. However, in 1614, Ieyasu was sufficiently concerned about Spanish territorial ambitions that he signed a Christian Expulsion Edict. The edict banned the practice of Christianity and led to the expulsion of all foreign missionaries. Although some smaller Dutch trading operations remained in Nagasaki, this edict dramatically curtailed foreign trade and marked the end of open Christian witness in Japan until the 1870s.[32] The immediate cause of the prohibition was the Okamoto Daihachi incident, a case of fraud involving Ieyasu's Catholic vavasor, but the shogunate was also concerned about a possible invasion by the Iberian colonial powers, which had previously occurred in the New World and the Philippines.[citation needed]\n\nConflict with Hideyori[edit]\n Grave of Ieyasu in Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b\nThe last remaining threat to Ieyasu's rule was Toyotomi Hideyori, the son and rightful heir to Hideyoshi.[1] He was now a young daimy\u014d living in Osaka Castle. Many samurai who opposed Ieyasu rallied around Hideyori, claiming that he was the rightful ruler of Japan. Ieyasu found fault with the opening ceremony of a temple built by Hideyori; it was as if he prayed for Ieyasu's death and the ruin of the Tokugawa clan. Ieyasu ordered Hideyori to leave Osaka Castle, but those in the castle refused and summoned samurai to gather within the castle. Then in 1614, Tokugawa besieged the Osaka Castle against Hideyori.\n\nSiege of Osaka[edit]\nMain article: Siege of Osaka\nThe Tokugawa forces, with a huge army led by Ieyasu and sh\u014dgun Hidetada, laid Siege of Osaka castle in what is now known as \"the Winter Siege of Osaka\". Eventually, Tokugawa was able to precipitate negotiations and an armistice after directed cannon fire threatened Hideyori's mother, Yodo-dono. However, once the treaty was agreed, Tokugawa filled the castle's outer moats with sand so his troops could walk across. Through this ploy, Tokugawa gained a huge tract of land through negotiation and deception that he could not through siege and combat. Ieyasu returned to Sunpu Castle once, but after Toyotomi refused another order to leave Osaka, he and his allied army of 155,000 soldiers attacked Osaka Castle again in \"the Summer Siege of Osaka\".\nFinally, in late 1615, Osaka Castle fell and nearly all the defenders were killed, including Hideyori, his mother (Hideyoshi's widow, Yodo-dono), and his infant son. His wife, Senhime (a granddaughter of Ieyasu), pleaded to save Hideyori and Yodo-dono's lives. Ieyasu refused and either required them to commit ritual suicide, or killed both of them. Eventually, Senhime was sent back to Tokugawa alive. After killing two people at Kamakura, who have escaped from Osaka Castle. With the Toyotomi line finally extinguished, no threats remained to the Tokugawa clan's domination of Japan.\n\nDeath[edit]\n The tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu in Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b\nIn 1616, Ieyasu died at age 73.[8] The cause of death is thought to have been cancer or syphilis. The first Tokugawa sh\u014dgun was posthumously deified with the name T\u014dsh\u014d Daigongen (\u6771\u7167\u5927\u6b0a\u73fe), the \"Great Gongen, Light of the East\". (A Gongen is believed to be a buddha who has appeared on Earth in the shape of a kami to save sentient beings). In life, Ieyasu had expressed the wish to be deified after his death to protect his descendants from evil. His remains were buried at the Gongens' mausoleum at Kun\u014dzan, Kun\u014dzan T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b (\u4e45\u80fd\u5c71\u6771\u7167\u5bae). As a common view, many people believe that \"after the first anniversary of his death, his remains were reburied at Nikk\u014d Shrine, Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b (\u65e5\u5149\u6771\u7167\u5bae). His remains are still there.\" Neither shrine has offered to open the graves, so the location of Ieyasu's physical remains is still a mystery. The mausoleum's architectural style became known as gongen-zukuri, that is gongen-style.[33] He was first given the Buddhist name Tosho Dai-Gongen (\u6771\u7167\u5927\u6b0a\u73fe), then after his death it was changed to Hogo Onkokuin (\u6cd5\u865f\u5b89\u570b\u9662).[citation needed]\n\nEra of Ieyasu's rule[edit]\nIeyasu ruled directly as sh\u014dgun or indirectly as \u014cgosho (\u5927\u5fa1\u6240) during the Keich\u014d era (1596\u20131615).\n\nIeyasu's character[edit]\n Handprint of Ieyasu at Kun\u014dzan T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b\n Precepts on the secret of success in life drafted by Tokugawa Ieyasu from the collection of Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b.\nIeyasu had a number of qualities that enabled him to rise to power. He was both careful and bold\u2014at the right times, and in the right places. Calculating and subtle, Ieyasu switched alliances when he thought he would benefit from the change. He allied with the Late H\u014dj\u014d clan; then he joined Hideyoshi's army of conquest, which destroyed the H\u014dj\u014d; and he himself took over their lands. In this he was like other daimy\u014d of his time. This was an era of violence, sudden death, and betrayal. He was not very well liked nor personally popular, but he was feared and he was respected for his leadership and his cunning. For example, he wisely kept his soldiers out of Hideyoshi's campaign in Korea.[citation needed]\nHe was capable of great loyalty: once he allied with Oda Nobunaga, he never went against him, and both leaders profited from their long alliance. He was known for being loyal towards his personal friends and vassals, whom he rewarded. He was said to have a close friendship with his vassal Hattori Hanz\u014d. However, he also remembered those who had wronged him in the past. It is said that Ieyasu executed a man who came into his power because he had insulted him when Ieyasu was young.[34]\nIeyasu protected many former Takeda retainers from the wrath of Oda Nobunaga, who was known to harbour a bitter grudge towards the Takeda. He managed successfully to transform many of the retainers of the Takeda, H\u014dj\u014d, and Imagawa clans\u2014all whom he had defeated himself or helped to defeat\u2014into loyal followers.  At the same time, he could be ruthless when crossed. For example, he ordered the executions of his first wife and his eldest son\u2014a son-in-law of Oda Nobunaga; Oda was also an uncle of Hidetada's wife Oeyo.[35]\nHe was cruel, relentless and merciless in the elimination of Toyotomi survivors after Osaka. For days, dozens and dozens of men and women were hunted down and executed, including an eight-year-old son of Hideyori by a concubine, who was beheaded.[36]\nUnlike Hideyoshi, he did not harbor any desires to conquer outside Japan\u2014he only wanted to bring order and an end to open warfare, and to rule Japan.[37]\nWhile at first tolerant of Christianity,[38] his attitude changed after 1613 and the executions of Christians sharply increased.[39]\nIeyasu's favorite pastime was falconry. He regarded it as excellent training for a warrior. \"When you go into the country hawking, you learn to understand the military spirit and also the hard life of the lower classes. You exercise your muscles and train your limbs. You have any amount of walking and running and become quite indifferent to heat and cold, and so you are little likely to suffer from any illness.\".[40] Ieyasu swam often; even late in his life he is reported to have swum in the moat of Edo Castle.[citation needed]\nLater in life he took to scholarship and religion, patronizing scholars like Hayashi Razan.[41]\nTwo of his famous quotes:\n\nLife is like unto a long journey with a heavy burden. Let thy step be slow and steady, that thou stumble not. Persuade thyself that imperfection and inconvenience are the lot of natural mortals, and there will be no room for discontent, neither for despair. When ambitious desires arise in thy heart, recall the days of extremity thou hast passed through. Forbearance is the root of all quietness and assurance forever. Look upon the wrath of thy enemy. If thou only knowest what it is to conquer, and knowest not what it is to be defeated; woe unto thee, it will fare ill with thee. Find fault with thyself rather than with others.[42]\nThe strong manly ones in life are those who understand the meaning of the word patience. Patience means restraining one's inclinations. There are seven emotions: joy, anger, anxiety, adoration, grief, fear, and hate, and if a man does not give way to these he can be called patient. I am not as strong as I might be, but I have long known and practiced patience. And if my descendants wish to be as I am, they must study patience.[43][44]\nHe said that he fought, as a warrior or a general, in 90 battles.[citation needed]\nHe was interested in various kenjutsu skills, was a patron of the Yagy\u016b Shinkage-ry\u016b school, and also had them as his personal sword instructors.[citation needed]\n\nHonours[edit]\nSenior First Rank (April 14, 1617;

Toranaga was portrayed by Toshiro Mifune in the 1980 TV mini-series adaptation.\nHyouge Mono (\u3078\u3046\u3052\u3082\u306e) is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Yamada. It was adapted into an anime series in 2011, and includes a fictional depiction of Tokugawa's life.\nIn Sengoku Basara game and anime series, he was shown with Honda Tadakatsu. In earlier games, he was armed with spears and led countless warriors, in later ones, he discards the spear and fights with his fists (similar to Boxing fighting style) and wants Japan united under the force of bonds.\nTokugawa is the leader of Japan in Sid Meier's Civilization IV. He is an aggressive and organized leader with an emphasis on mercantilism.\nIn the 2021 Netflix documentary series Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan, Ieyasu is prominently portrayed by Hayate Masao. The show depicts his life and rise to power.\nIeyasu features as a character in Ik\u00e9men Sengoku, a dating simulator otome game released by Cybird in 2015.\n\nHonn\u014dji theory[edit]\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (March 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nAmong the many conspiracies surrounding the Honn\u014d-ji Incident is Ieyasu's role in the event. Historically, Ieyasu was away from his lord at the time and, when he heard that Nobunaga was in danger, he wanted to rush to his lord's rescue in spite of the small number of attendants with him. However, Tadakatsu advised for his lord to avoid the risk and urged for a quick retreat to Mikawa. Masanari led the way through Iga and they returned home by boat.\nHowever, skeptics think otherwise. While they usually accept the historically known facts about Ieyasu's actions during Mitsuhide's betrayal, theorists tend to pay more attention to the events before. Ever since Ieyasu lost his wife and son due to Nobunaga's orders, they reason, he held a secret resentment against his lord. Generally, there is some belief that he privately goaded Mitsuhide to take action when the two warlords were together in Azuchi Castle. Together, they planned when to attack and went their separate ways. When the deed was done, Ieyasu turned a blind eye to Mitsuhide's schemes and fled the scene to feign innocence. A variation of the concept states that Ieyasu was well aware of Mitsuhide's feelings regarding Nobunaga and simply chose to do nothing for his own benefit.\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\nJapan portal\nHistory portal\nBiography portal\nShitenn\u014d (Tokugawa clan)\nEast Asian age reckoning\nList of T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b\nTestament of Ieyasu\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j Perez, Louis G.

In this period, children were considered one year old at birth and became two the following New Year's Day; and all people advanced a year that day, not on their actual birthday.\n\n^ a b c Turnbull, Stephen (2012).
