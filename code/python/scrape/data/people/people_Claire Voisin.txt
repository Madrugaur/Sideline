{"name": "Claire Voisin", "content": "Claire Voisin (born 4 March 1962) is a French mathematician known for her work in algebraic geometry. She is a member of the French Academy of Sciences and holds the chair of Algebraic Geometry at the Coll\u00e8ge de France.\n She is noted for her work in algebraic geometry particularly as it pertains to variations of Hodge structures and mirror symmetry, and has written several books on Hodge theory.  In 2002, Voisin proved that the generalization of the Hodge conjecture for compact K\u00e4hler varieties is false.[1]  The Hodge conjecture is one of the seven Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize Problems which were selected in 2000, each having a prize of one million US dollars.\n Voisin won the European Mathematical Society Prize  in 1992 and the Servant Prize awarded by the Academy of Sciences in 1996.[2]  She received the Sophie Germain Prize in 2003[3] and the Clay Research Award in 2008 for her disproof of the Kodaira conjecture on deformations of compact K\u00e4hler manifolds.[4] In 2007, she was awarded the Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics for, in addition to her work on the Kodaira conjecture, solving the generic case of Green's conjecture on the syzygies of the canonical embedding of an algebraic curve.[5] This case of Green's conjecture had \nreceived considerable attention from algebraic geometers for over two decades prior to its resolution by Voisin (the full conjecture for arbitrary curves is still partially open).\n She was an invited speaker at the 1994 International Congress of Mathematicians in Z\u00fcrich in the section 'Algebraic Geometry', and she was also invited as a plenary speaker at the 2010 International Congress of Mathematicians in Hyderabad.[6]\nIn 2014, she was elected to the Academia Europaea.[7]\nIn May 2016, she was elected as a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences.[8] Also in 2016, she became the first female mathematician member of the Coll\u00e8ge de France and is the first holder of the Chair of Algebraic Geometry.[9] She received the Gold medal of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) in September 2016. The latter is the highest scientific research award in France.[10] In 2017, she received the Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences together with J\u00e1nos Koll\u00e1r.[11]\n She is married to the applied mathematician Jean-Michel Coron.
