The following year she was appointed to the Department of Mathematics.[4] According to McNair,[2] \"When Agnes Scott became a college in 1905-1906, [Young] continued in the college faculty; however, feeling that she should have a degree, she took the requisite courses and received her B.A. degree in 1910.\"[2] (According to a different source, she earned her A.B. degree in 1898.[1]) \n From 1910 until her sudden passing in 1920, she served as Professor of Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy at Agnes Scott.[5] She also taught summer school at the University of Georgia.[1][6]\n In 1914, Young took a leave of absence to earn her master's degree in education from Columbia University in New York.[1][7]\n \nAccording to McNair, she was known as an exceptional teacher.  \n\"One account is of a senior who repeatedly failed trigonometry 'until the day came when she had the last exam that she could have on it.
