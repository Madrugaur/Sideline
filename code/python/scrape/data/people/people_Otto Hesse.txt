{"name": "Otto Hesse", "content": "Ludwig Otto Hesse (22 April 1811 \u2013 4 August 1874) was a German mathematician. Hesse was born in K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia, and died in Munich, Bavaria. He worked mainly on algebraic invariants, and geometry. The Hessian matrix, the Hesse normal form, the Hesse configuration, the Hessian group, Hessian pairs,  Hesse's theorem, Hesse pencil, and the Hesse transfer principle[2] are named after him. Many of Hesse's research findings were presented for the first time in Crelle's Journal or Hesse's textbooks.[3]\n Hesse was born in K\u00f6nigsberg (today Kaliningrad) as the son of Johann Gottlieb Hesse, a businessman and brewery owner and his wife Anna Karoline Reiter (1788\u20131865). He studied in his hometown at the Albertina under Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Among his teachers were count Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel and Friedrich Julius Richelot. He earned his doctorate in 1840 at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg with the dissertation De octo punctis intersectionis trium superficium secundi ordinis. In 1841, Hesse completed his habilitation thesis. In the same year he married Sophie Marie Emilie Dulk, the daughter of pharmacists and chemistry professor Friedrich Philipp Dulk (1788\u20131852). The couple had a son and five daughters. Hesse taught for some time physics and chemistry at the Vocational School in K\u00f6nigsberg and lectured at the Albertina. In 1845 he was appointed associate professor in K\u00f6nigsberg. In 1855 he moved to Halle and in 1856 to Heidelberg until 1868, when he finally moved to Munich to the newly established Polytechnic School. In 1869 he joined the Bavarian Academy of Sciences.\n His doctoral students include Olaus Henrici, Gustav Kirchhoff, Jacob L\u00fcroth, Adolph Mayer, Carl Neumann, Max Noether, Ernst Schr\u00f6der, and Heinrich Martin Weber.[1]\n His collected works were published in 1897 by Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities.\n \n This article about a German mathematician is a stub.
