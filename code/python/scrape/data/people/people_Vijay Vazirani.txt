His dissertation, Maximum Matchings without Blossoms, was supervised by Manuel Blum.[2]\nAfter postdoctoral research with Michael O. Rabin and Leslie Valiant at Harvard University, he joined the faculty at Cornell University in 1984. He moved to the IIT Delhi as a full professor in 1990, and moved again to the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1995. He was also a McKay Visiting Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Distinguished SISL Visitor at the Social and Information Sciences Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. In 2017 he moved to the University of California, Irvine as Distinguished Professor.\n Vazirani's research career has been centered around the design of algorithms, together with work on computational complexity theory, cryptography, and algorithmic game theory.\n During the 1980s, he made seminal contributions to the classical maximum matching problem,[3] and some key contributions to computational complexity theory, e.g., the isolation lemma, the Valiant-Vazirani theorem, and the equivalence between random generation and approximate counting.[4] During the 1990s he worked mostly on approximation algorithms, championing the primal-dual schema, which he applied to problems arising in network design, facility location[5] and web caching, and clustering. In July 2001 he published what is widely regarded as the definitive book on approximation algorithms (Springer-Verlag, Berlin).
