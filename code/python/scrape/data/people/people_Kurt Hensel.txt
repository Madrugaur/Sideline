{"name": "Kurt Hensel", "content": "Kurt Wilhelm Sebastian Hensel (29 December 1861 \u2013 1 June 1941) was a German mathematician born in K\u00f6nigsberg.\n Hensel was born in K\u00f6nigsberg, East Prussia (today Kaliningrad, Russia), the son of Julia (n\u00e9e von Adelson) and landowner and entrepreneur Sebastian Hensel. He was the brother of philosopher Paul Hensel. Kurt and Paul's paternal grandparents were painter Wilhelm Hensel and composer Fanny Mendelssohn. Fanny was the sister of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, daughter of Abraham Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and great-granddaughter of philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, and entrepreneur Daniel Itzig. Both of Hensel's paternal grandmothers and his mother were from Jewish families that had converted to Christianity.\n Hensel studied mathematics in Berlin and Bonn, under the mathematicians Leopold Kronecker and Karl Weierstrass.\n Later in his life Hensel was a professor at the University of Marburg until 1930. He was also an editor of the mathematical Crelle's Journal. He edited the five-volume collected works of Leopold Kronecker.\n Hensel is well known for his introduction of p-adic numbers.
