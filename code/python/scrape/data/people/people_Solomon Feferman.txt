{"name": "Solomon Feferman", "content": "\n Solomon Feferman (December 13, 1928 \u2013 July 26, 2016)[2] was an American philosopher and mathematician who worked in mathematical logic.\n Solomon Feferman was born in The Bronx in New York City to working-class parents who had immigrated to the United States after World War I and had met and married in New York. Neither parent had any advanced education.  The family moved to Los Angeles, where Feferman graduated from high school at age 16. \n He received his B.S. from the California Institute of Technology in 1948, and in 1957 his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley, under Alfred Tarski,[3] after having been drafted and having served in the U.S. Army from 1953 to 1955. In 1956 he was appointed to the Departments of Mathematics and Philosophy at Stanford University, where he later became the Patrick Suppes Professor of Humanities and Sciences.[4]\n Feferman was editor-in-chief of the five-volume Collected Works of Kurt G\u00f6del, published by Oxford University Press between 2001 and 2013.\n In 2004, together with his wife Anita Burdman Feferman, he published a biography of Alfred Tarski: Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic.[5]\n He worked on predicative mathematics, in particular introducing the Feferman\u2013Sch\u00fctte ordinal as a measure of the strength of certain predicative systems.\n Feferman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1972 and 1986[6] and the Rolf Schock Prize in logic and philosophy in 2003.[7] In 2006 he was invited to deliver the Tarski Lectures.
