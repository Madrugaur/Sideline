{"name": "Charles Correa", "content": "\n Charles Mark Correa (1 September 1930 \u2013 16 June 2015) was an Indian architect and urban planner. Credited with the creation of modern architecture in post-Independent India, he was celebrated for his sensitivity to the needs of the urban poor and for his use of traditional methods and materials.[1]\n Charles Correa, a Roman Catholic of Goan descent, was born on 1 September 1930 in Secunderabad.[2][3] He began his higher studies at St. Xavier's College, Mumbai. He went on to study at the University of Michigan (1949\u201353) where Buckminster Fuller was a teacher, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1953\u201355) where he obtained his master's degree.[4][5]\n In 1958, Charles Correa established his own professional practice in Mumbai. His first significant project was the Mahatma Gandhi Sangrahalaya (Mahatma Gandhi Memorial) at Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad (1958\u20131963), followed by the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly in Bhopal (1967). In 1961-1966, he designed his first high-rise building, the Sonmarg apartments in Mumbai. On the National Crafts Museum in New Delhi (1975\u20131990), he introduced \"the rooms open to the sky\", his systematic use of courtyards. In the Jawahar Kala Kendra (Jawahar Arts Centre) in Jaipur (1986\u20131992), he makes a structural hommage to Jai Singh II. Later, he invited the British artist Howard Hodgkin for the outside design of the British Council in Delhi (1987\u20131992).[5]\n From 1970\u201375, Charles Correa was Chief Architect for New Bombay (Navi Mumbai), where he was strongly involved in extensive urban planning of the new city.[6][5] In 1984, Charles Correa founded the Urban Design Research Institute in Bombay,[5] dedicated to the protection of the built environment and improvement of urban communities. During the final four decades of his life, Correa has done pioneering work in urban issues and low-cost shelter in the Third World. In 1985, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi appointed him Chairman of the National Commission on Urbanization.\n From 2005 until his 2008 resignation Correa was the Chairman of the Delhi Urban Arts Commission.\n Later, Charles Correa designed the new Ismaili Centre in Toronto, Canada,[7] which shared the site with the Aga Khan Museum designed by Fumihiko Maki,[8] and the Champalimaud Foundation Centre in Lisbon, inaugurated by the Portuguese President An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva on 5 October 2010.[9]\n He died on 16 June 2015 in Mumbai following a brief illness.[10]\n Charles Correa designed almost 100 buildings in India, from low-income housing to luxury condos. He rejected the glass-and-steel approach of some post-modernist buildings, and focused on designs deeply rooted in local cultures, all the while providing modern structural solutions under his creative designs. His style was also focused on reintroducing outdoor spaces and terraces.[11][12]\n His work is the physical manifestation of the idea of Indian nationhood, modernity and progress. His vision sits at the nexus defining the contemporary Indian sensibility and it articulates a new Indian identity with a language that has a global resonance. He is someone who has that rare capacity to give physical form to something as intangible as \u2018culture\u2019 or \u2018society\u2019 \u2013 and his work is therefore critical: aesthetically; sociologically; and culturally. In 2013, the Royal Institute of British Architects held a retrospective exhibition, \"Charles Correa \u2013 India's Greatest Architect\", about the influences of his work on modern urban Indian architecture.[6][13]\n Charles Correa married Monika (n\u00e9e Sequeira), an artist, in 1961. Together they lived in one of the flats of the Sonmarg apartments in Mumbai. They had two children.[5]\n ", "tags": ["1930 births", "2015 deaths", "Disease-related deaths in India", "Indian people of Goan descent", "St. Xavier's College, Mumbai alumni", "Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning alumni", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni", "Postmodern architecture in India", "Urban designers", "Indian urban planners", "Recipients of the Padma Shri in science & engineering", "Recipients of the Padma Vibhushan in science & engineering", "Recipients of the Royal Gold Medal", "Recipients of the Praemium Imperiale", "Recipients of the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art", "20th-century Indian architects", "People from Secunderabad", "Indian environmentalists", "Activists from Andhra Pradesh", "20th-century Indian educational theorists", "Founders of Indian schools and colleges", "21st-century Indian architects", "21st-century Indian educational theorists", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "EngvarB from September 2014", "Use dmy dates from September 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For the Brazilian canoeist, see Charles Corr\u00eaa.\n\n\nCharles CorreaCorrea in 2011Born(1930-09-01)1 September 1930Secunderabad, IndiaDied16 June 2015(2015-06-16) (aged\u00a084)Mumbai, IndiaNationalityIndianAlma\u00a0materUniversity of MumbaiMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyUniversity of MichiganOccupationArchitectUrban plannerBuildingsJawahar Kala Kendra, National Crafts Museum, Bharat Bhavan\n\nCharles Mark Correa (1 September 1930 \u2013 16 June 2015) was an Indian architect and urban planner.
