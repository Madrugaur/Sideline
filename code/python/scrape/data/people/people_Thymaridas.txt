Thymaridas of Paros, an ancient Pythagorean already mentioned (p. 69), was the author of a rule for solving a certain set of n simultaneous simple equations connecting n unknown quantities. The rule was evidently well known, for it was called by the special name [...] the 'flower' or 'bloom' of Thymaridas. [...] The rule is very obscurely worded , but it states in effect that, if we have the following n equations connecting n unknown quantities x, x1, x2 ... xn\u22121, namely [...] Iamblichus, our informant on this subject, goes on to show that other types of equations can be reduced to this, so that the rule  does not 'leave us in the lurch' in those cases either.\n\n^ Flegg (1983). \"Unknown Numbers\". Numbers: Their History and Meaning. pp.\u00a0205. Thymaridas (fourth century) is said to have had this rule for solving a particular set of n linear equations in n unknowns:If the sum of n quantities be given, and also the sum of every pair containing a particular quantity, then this particular quantity is equal to 1/(n\u00a0+\u00a02) of the difference between the sums of these pairs and the first given sum.\n\n\nExternal links[edit]\nThymaridas of Paros\nThe mac-tutor biography of Thymaridas\nvteAncient Greek and Hellenistic mathematics (Euclidean geometry)Mathematicians(timeline)\nAnaxagoras\nAnthemius\nArchytas\nAristaeus the Elder\nAristarchus\nApollonius\nArchimedes\nAutolycus\nBion\nBryson\nCallippus\nCarpus\nChrysippus\nCleomedes\nConon\nCtesibius\nDemocritus\nDicaearchus\nDiocles\nDiophantus\nDinostratus\nDionysodorus\nDomninus\nEratosthenes\nEudemus\nEuclid\nEudoxus\nEutocius\nGeminus\nHeliodorus\nHeron\nHipparchus\nHippasus\nHippias\nHippocrates\nHypatia\nHypsicles\nIsidore of Miletus\nLeon\nMarinus\nMenaechmus\nMenelaus\nMetrodorus\nNicomachus\nNicomedes\nNicoteles\nOenopides\nPappus\nPerseus\nPhilolaus\nPhilon\nPhilonides\nPorphyry\nPosidonius\nProclus\nPtolemy\nPythagoras\nSerenus \nSimplicius\nSosigenes\nSporus\nThales\nTheaetetus\nTheano\nTheodorus\nTheodosius\nTheon of Alexandria\nTheon of Smyrna\nThymaridas\nXenocrates\nZeno of Elea\nZeno of Sidon\nZenodorus\nTreatises\nAlmagest\nArchimedes Palimpsest\nArithmetica\nConics (Apollonius)\nCatoptrics\nData (Euclid)\nElements (Euclid)\nMeasurement of a Circle\nOn Conoids and Spheroids\nOn the Sizes and Distances (Aristarchus)\nOn Sizes and Distances (Hipparchus)\nOn the Moving Sphere (Autolycus)\nEuclid's Optics\nOn Spirals\nOn the Sphere and Cylinder\nOstomachion\nPlanisphaerium\nSphaerics\nThe Quadrature of the Parabola\nThe Sand Reckoner\nProblems\nAngle trisection\nDoubling the cube\nSquaring the circle\nProblem of Apollonius\nConcepts/definitions\nCircles of Apollonius\nApollonian circles\nApollonian gasket\nCircumscribed circle\nCommensurability\nDiophantine equation\nDoctrine of proportionality\nGolden ratio\nGreek numerals\nIncircle and excircles of a triangle\nMethod of exhaustion\nParallel postulate\nPlatonic solid\nLune of Hippocrates\nQuadratrix of Hippias\nRegular polygon\nStraightedge and compass construction\nTriangle center\nResultsIn Elements\nAngle bisector theorem\nExterior angle theorem\nEuclidean algorithm\nEuclid's theorem\nGeometric mean theorem\nGreek geometric algebra\nHinge theorem\nInscribed angle theorem\nIntercept theorem\nPons asinorum\nPythagorean theorem\nThales's theorem\nTheorem of the gnomon\nApollonius\nApollonius's theorem\nOther\nAristarchus's inequality\nCrossbar theorem\nHeron's formula\nIrrational numbers\nMenelaus's theorem\nPappus's area theorem\nProblem II.8 of Arithmetica\nPtolemy's inequality\nPtolemy's table of chords\nPtolemy's theorem\nSpiral of Theodorus\nCenters\nCyrene\nLibrary of Alexandria\nPlatonic Academy\nOther\nAncient Greek astronomy\nGreek numerals\nLatin translations of the 12th century\nNeusis construction\n\nAuthority control \nGND: 102408238\nVIAF: 22528456\n WorldCat Identities (via VIAF): 22528456\n\n\n\n\n"}
