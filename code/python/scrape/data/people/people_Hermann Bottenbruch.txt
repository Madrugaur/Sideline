{"name": "Hermann Bottenbruch", "content": "Hermann Bottenbruch (September 14, 1928 \u2013 20 May 2019) was a German mathematician and computer scientist.[1]\n Bottenbruch grew up in M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Toward the end of World War II, he served as a flakhelfer. In 1947, he began the study of mathematics at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t Bonn where he graduated in 1951. Following graduation, he joined the staff of the Institute for Applied Mathematics at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt (TU Darmstadt). The institute was founded by Alwin Walther. Bottenbruch earned his doctorate there in 1957.\n In the same year on Walther's recommendation he joined the international working group to develop a new programming language. This language was intended to combine then current understanding of programming languages into one standard. According to Friedrich Bauer, Bottenbruch coined the name ALGOL, at least for Germany, from the English Algorithmic Language. In 1958, the members of the working group met at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich), including Friedrich L. Bauer, Bottenbruch, Heinz Rutishauser, Klaus Samelson, John Backus, Charles Katz, Alan Perlis, and Joseph Henry Wegstein. The result of their deliberations was ALGOL 58.\n In 1960 and 1961, Bottenbruch worked in the United States at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). After that, he took a leading position in German industry where, among other things, he served as a specialist in the field of flue-gas stack (industrial chimney) construction. In 1994, he founded his own company, Primasoft GmbH, in the German city of Oberhausen, providing information technology consulting including databases.\n ", "tags": ["1928 births", "2019 deaths", "German computer scientists", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Programming language designers", "People from M\u00fclheim", "University of Bonn alumni", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt alumni", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory people", "German company founders", "Technology company founders", "Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt faculty", "21st-century German mathematicians", "Luftwaffenhelfer", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from September 2019", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles needing additional references from November 2019", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Articles containing German-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician and computer scientist\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.
