{"name": "Mashallah ibn Athari", "content": "M\u0101 Sh\u0101\u2019 All\u0101h ibn Athari (Arabic: \u0645\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0625\u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062b\u0631\u064a\u200e)[1] (c.740\u2013815 CE) was an eighth-century Persian Jewish[2] astrologer, astronomer, and mathematician. Originally from Khorasan[3] he lived in Basra (present day Iraq) during the reigns of al-Man\u1e63\u016br and al-Ma\u2019m\u016bn, and was among those who introduced astrology and astronomy to Baghd\u0101d in the late 8th and early 9th century.[4] The bibliographer al-Nadim in his  Fihrist, described him \"as virtuous and in his time a leader in the science of jurisprudence, i.e. the science of judgments of the stars\".[5] He served as a court astrologer for the Abbasid caliphate, and wrote numerous works on astrology in Arabic. Some Latin translations survive.\n The Arabic phrase ma sha`a allah indicates a believer's acceptance of God's ordainment of good or ill fortune. The name (Ma) Sha'a Allah is probably an Arabic rendering of Hebrew Sh'luh (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u200e), which in is the name of the Messiah referenced in Genesis 49:10. Al-Nadim writes Mashallah's name 'M\u012bsh\u0101', means \"yithro\" (\u064a\u062b\u0631\u0648), which is probably the Hebrew name Jethro, from yithr\u0101 (\u201cabundance\u201d).[1] [6] Latin translators called him many variants such as Messahala, Messahalla, Messala, Macellama, Macelarma, Messahalah, etc. \nThe crater Messala on the Moon is named after him.\n As a young man he participated in the founding of Baghdad for Caliph al-Man\u1e63\u016br in 762 by working with a group of astrologers led by Naubakht the Persian to pick an electional horoscope for the founding of the city[7] and building of an observatory.[8]  Attributed the author of over twenty titles, predominantly on astrology, his authority was established over the centuries in the Middle East, and later in the West, when horoscopic astrology was transmitted to Europe from the 12th century. His writings include both what would be recognized as traditional horary astrology and an earlier type of astrology which casts consultation charts to divine the client's intention.[7] The strong influence of Hermes Trismegistus and Dorotheus is evident in his work.[9]\n Mashallah's treatise De mercibus (On Prices) is the oldest known scientific work extant in Arabic [10] and the only work of his extant in its original Arabic.[11] Multiple translations into medieval Latin, [12] Byzantine Greek[13][14] and Hebrew were made. \n One of his most popular works in the Middle Ages was a cosmological treatise This comprehensive account of the cosmos along Aristotelian lines, covers many topics important to early cosmology. Postulating a ten-orb universe it strays from traditional cosmology. Mashallah aimed at the lay reader and illustrated his main ideas with comprehensible diagrams. Two versions of the manuscript were printed: a short version (27 chapters) De scientia motus orbis, and an expanded version (40 chapters) De elementis et orbibus.[5] The short version was translated by Gherardo Cremonese (Gerard of Cremona). Both were printed in Nuremberg, in 1504 and 1549, respectively. This work is commonly abbreviated to De orbe.\n Mashallah's treatise on the astrolabe (p 10) is the first known of its kind.[9] Later translated from Arabic into Latin  (De Astrolabii Compositione et Ultilitate). The  exact source of Geoffrey Chaucer's Treatise on the Astrolabe (1391) in Middle English is undetermined but most of his \u2018conclusions\u2019 go back, directly or indirectly, to a Latin translation of Mashallah's work, called  Compositio et Operatio Astrolabii.  Chaucer's description of the instrument amplifies Mashallah\u2019s, and his indebtedness was recognised by John Selden in 1613 [15] and established by Walter William Skeat.  While Mark Harvey Liddell held that Chaucer drew on De Sphaera of John de Sacrobosco for the substantial part of his astronomical definitions and descriptions, the non-correspondence suggests his probable source was another compilation. Skeat's Treatise of the Astrolabe includes a collotype MS facsimile of the Latin version of the second part of Mashallah\u2019s work, which parallels Chaucer's.[16] This is also found in R. T. Gunther's, Chaucer and Messahala on Astrology.[17]\nDe elementis et orbibus was included in Gregor Reisch's Margarita phylosophica (ed. pr., Freiburg, 1503; Suter says the text is included in the Basel edition of 1583). Its contents primarily deal with the construction and usage of an astrolabe.\n In 1981, Paul Kunitzsch argued that the treatise on the astrolabe long attributed to Mashallah is in fact written by Ibn al-Saffar.[18][19]\n Other astronomical and astrological writings are quoted by Suter and Steinschneider.\n An Irish astronomical tract[22] appears based in part on a medieval Latin version of Mashallah. Two-thirds of tract are part-paraphrase part-translation. \n The 12th-century scholar and astrologer Abraham ibn Ezra translated two of Mashallah's astrological treatises into Hebrew: She'elot and \u1e32adrut (Steinschneider, \"Hebr. Uebers.\" pp.\u00a0600\u2013603). \n Eleven modern translations of Mashallah's astrological treatises have been translated out of Latin into English.[7]\n Mashallah postulated a ten-orb universe rather than the eight-orb model offered by Aristotle and the nine-orb model that was popular in his time. In all Mashallah's planetary model ascribes 26 orbs to the universe , which account for the relative positioning and motion of the seven planets. Of the ten orbs, the first seven contain the planets and the eighth contain the fixed stars. The ninth and tenth orbs were named by Mashallah the \"Orb of Signs\" and the \"Great Orb\", respectively. Both of these orbs are starless and move with the diurnal motion, but the tenth orb moves in the plane of the celestial equator while the ninth orb moves around poles that are inclined 24\u00b0 with respect to the poles of the tenth orb. The ninth is also divided into twelve parts which are named after the zodiacal constellations that can be seen beneath them in the eighth orb. The eight and ninth orbs move around the same poles, but with different motion. The ninth orb moves with daily motion, so that the 12 signs are static with\nrespect to the equinoxes, the eighth Orb of the Fixed Stars moves 1\u00b0 in 100 years, so that the 12 zodiacal constellations are mobile with respect to the equinoxes.[5] The eight and ninth orbs moving around the same poles also guarantees that the 12 stationary signs and the 12 mobile zodiacal constellations overlap. By describing the universe in such a manner, Mashallah was attempting to demonstrate the natural reality\nof the 12 signs by stressing that the stars are located with respect to the signs and that fundamental natural phenomena, such as the beginning of the seasons, changes of weather, and the passage of the months, take place in the sublunar domain when the sun enters the signs of the ninth orb .[5]\n Mashallah was an advocate of the idea that the conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter dictate the timing of important events on Earth. These conjunctions, which occur about every twenty years, take place in the same triplicity for about two hundred years, and special significance is attached to a shift to another triplicity.[20]\n Footnotes\n Citations\n Bibliography\n \n ", "tags": ["8th-century births", "810s deaths", "8th-century Arabic writers", "8th-century astrologers", "8th-century astronomers", "8th-century Iranian people", "8th-century Jews", "8th-century Persian mathematicians", "9th-century Iranian people", "9th-century Jews", "9th-century astrologers", "9th-century Arabic writers", "Scholars of the Abbasid Caliphate", "Astronomers of medieval Islam", "Jewish astronomers", "Court scholars", "Jews of the Abbasid Caliphate", "Medieval Jewish astrologers", "Medieval Jewish astronomers", "People from Basra", "Medieval Persian astrologers", "Medieval Persian astronomers", "Medieval Persian Jews", "9th-century Persian mathematicians", "Mathematicians of medieval Islam", "8th-century people of the Abbasid Caliphate", "9th-century people of the Abbasid Caliphate", "Articles containing Arabic-language text", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Persian mathematician and astronomer\nFor other uses, see Mashallah (disambiguation).\nMasha'allah ibn AthariBorn740Basra,  Abbasid Caliphate, IraqDied815  (aged 75)Baghdad,  Abbasid Caliphate, IraqOccupationAstronomer\nM\u0101 Sh\u0101\u2019 All\u0101h ibn Athari (Arabic: \u0645\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0625\u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062b\u0631\u064a\u200e)[1] (c.740\u2013815 CE) was an eighth-century Persian Jewish[2] astrologer, astronomer, and mathematician.
