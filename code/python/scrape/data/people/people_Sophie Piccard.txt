{"name": "Sophie Piccard", "content": "\n Sophie Piccard (1904\u20131990) was a Russian-Swiss mathematician who became the first female full professor (professor ordinarius) in Switzerland.[1][2] Her research concerned set theory, group theory, linear algebra, and the history of mathematics.[1]\n Piccard was born on September 27, 1904 in Saint Petersburg, with a French Huguenot mother and a Swiss father. She earned a diploma in Smolensk in 1925, where her father, Eug\u00e8ne-Ferdinand Piccard, was a university professor and her mother a language teacher at the lyc\u00e9e. Soon afterwards she moved to Switzerland with her parents, escaping the unrest in Russia that her mother, Eulalie Piccard, would become known for writing about. Sophie Piccard's Russian degree was worthless in Switzerland, and she earned another from the University of Lausanne in 1927, going on to complete a doctorate there in 1929 under the supervision of Dmitry Mirimanoff.[1][2][3]\n She worked outside of mathematics until 1936, when she began teaching part-time at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel as an assistant to Rudolf Gaberel.
