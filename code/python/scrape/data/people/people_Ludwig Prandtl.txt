{"name": "Ludwig Prandtl", "content": "Ludwig Prandtl (4 February 1875 \u2013 15 August 1953)[1] was a German fluid dynamicist, physicist and aerospace scientist. He was a pioneer in the development of rigorous systematic mathematical analyses which he used for underlying the science of aerodynamics, which have come to form the basis of the applied science of aeronautical engineering.[2] In the 1920s he developed the mathematical basis for the fundamental principles of subsonic aerodynamics in particular; and in general up to and including transonic velocities. His studies identified the boundary layer, thin-airfoils, and lifting-line theories. The Prandtl number was named after him.\n Prandtl was born in Freising, near Munich, in 1875. His mother suffered from a lengthy illness and, as a result, Ludwig spent more time with his father, a professor of engineering. His father also encouraged him to observe nature and think about his observations.\n He entered the Technische Hochschule Munich in 1894 and graduated with a Ph.D. under guidance of Professor August Foeppl in six years.[3] His work at Munich had been in solid mechanics, and his first job was as an engineer designing factory equipment. There, he entered the field of fluid mechanics where he had to design a suction device. After carrying out some experiments, he came up with a new device that worked well and used less power than the one it replaced.\n In 1901 Prandtl became a professor of fluid mechanics at the technical school in Hannover, later the Technical University Hannover and now the University of Hannover. It was here that he developed many of his most important theories. On August 8th 1904, he delivered a groundbreaking paper, \u00dcber Fl\u00fcssigkeitsbewegung bei sehr kleiner Reibung (On the Motion of Fluids in Very Little Friction), at the Third International Mathematics Congress in Heidelberg.[4][5][6] In this paper, he described the boundary layer and its importance for drag and streamlining. The paper also described flow separation as a result of the boundary layer, clearly explaining the concept of stall for the first time. Several of his students made attempts at closed-form solutions, but failed, and in the end the approximation contained in his original paper remains in widespread use.\n The effect of the paper was so great that Prandtl became director of the Institute for Technical Physics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen later in the year. Over the next decades he developed it into a powerhouse of aerodynamics, leading the world until the end of World War II. In 1925 the university spun off his research arm to create the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Flow Research (now the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization).\n Following earlier leads by Frederick Lanchester from 1902\u20131907, Prandtl worked with Albert Betz and Max Munk on the problem of a useful mathematical tool for examining lift from \"real world\" wings. The results were published in 1918\u20131919, known as the Lanchester\u2013Prandtl wing theory. He also made specific additions to study cambered airfoils, like those on World War I aircraft, and published a simplified thin-airfoil theory for these designs. This work led to the realization that on any wing of finite length,  wing-tip effects became very important to the overall performance and characterization of the wing. Considerable work was included on the nature of induced drag and wingtip vortices, which had previously been ignored. Prandtl showed that an elliptical spanwise lift distribution the most efficient, giving the minimum induced drag for the given span. These tools enabled aircraft designers to make meaningful theoretical studies of their aircraft before they were built.\n Prandtl later extended his theory to describe a bell-like lift distribution, obtained by washing out the wing tips until negative lift was obtained, which gave the minimum induced drag for any given aircraft weight, also suggesting that adverse yaw forces could be countered solely by wing tip aerodynamics, but this new theory was largely ignored. In the 21st century the American engineer Al Bowers has confirmed the idea, calling his experimental wing the PRANDTL-D.[7]\n Prandtl and his student Theodor Meyer developed the first theories of supersonic shock waves and flow in 1908. The Prandtl\u2013Meyer expansion fans allowed for the construction of supersonic wind tunnels. He had little time to work on the problem further until the 1920s, when he worked with Adolf Busemann and created a method for designing a supersonic nozzle in 1929. Today, all supersonic wind tunnels and rocket nozzles are designed using the same method. A full development of supersonics would have to wait for the work of Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, a student of Prandtl at G\u00f6ttingen.\n In 1922 Prandtl, together with Richard von Mises, founded the GAMM (the International Association of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics).[8] and was its chairman from 1922 until 1933. Until 1945 he also worked closely with the RLM.\n Other work examined the problem of compressibility at high subsonic speeds, known as the Prandtl\u2013Glauert correction. This became very useful during World War II as aircraft began approaching supersonic speeds for the first time. He also worked on meteorology, plasticity and structural mechanics.\n After Hitler's rise to power and the establishment of the Third Reich, Prandtl continued his role as director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society. During this period the Nazi air ministry, led by Hermann G\u00f6ring, often used Prandtl's international reputation as a scientist to promote Germany's scientific agenda. Prandtl appears to have happily served as an ambassador for the Nazi regime, writing in 1937 to a NACA representative \"I believe that Fascism in Italy and National Socialism in Germany represent very good beginnings of new thinking and economics.\" Prandtl's support for the regime is apparent in his letters to G. I. Taylor and his wife in 1938 and 1939. Referring to Nazi Germany's treatment of Jews, Prandtl wrote \"The struggle, which Germany unfortunately had to fight against the Jews, was necessary for its self-preservation.\" Prandtl also claimed that \"If there will be war, the guilt to have caused it by political measures is this time unequivocally on the side of England.\"[9]\n Prandtl worked at G\u00f6ttingen until he died on 15 August 1953. His work in fluid dynamics is still used today in many areas of aerodynamics and chemical engineering. He is often referred to as the father of modern aerodynamics.\n The crater Prandtl on the far side of the Moon is named in his honour.\n The Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring is awarded by Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt in his honour for outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering.\n In 1992, Prandtl was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.[10]\n ", "tags": ["1875 births", "1953 deaths", "Aerodynamicists", "Commanders Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "Fluid dynamicists", "German physicists", "People from Freising", "Recipients of the Knights Cross of the War Merit Cross", "Technical University of Munich alumni", "University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "CS1 maint: others", "Articles with hCards", "Commons link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Ludwig PrandtlLudwig PrandtlBorn(1875-02-04)4 February 1875Freising, Upper Bavaria, German EmpireDied15 August 1953(1953-08-15) (aged\u00a078)G\u00f6ttingen, West GermanyNationalityGermanAlma\u00a0materTechnical University of Munich, RWTH AachenKnown\u00a0forBoundary layer  Mixing length theoryLifting-line theoryMembrane analogyPrandtl conditionPrandtl number Prandtl\u2013Meyer expansion fanPrandtl\u2013Meyer functionPrandtl-Batchelor theorem Prandtl\u2013Glauert transformation Prandtl\u2013Glauert singularityPrandtl\u2013Tomlinson modelAwardsAckermann\u2013Teubner Memorial Award (1918)Daniel Guggenheim Medal (1930)Wilhelm Exner Medal 1951Scientific careerFieldsAerodynamicsInstitutionsUniversity of G\u00f6ttingen,  Technical University of HannoverThesisTilting Phenomena, A case of unstable elastic balance\u00a0(1899)Doctoral advisorAugust F\u00f6pplDoctoral studentsAckeret, Blasius, Busemann, Munk, Nikuradse, Pohlhausen, Schlichting, Tietjens, Tollmien, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, Timoshenko, V\u00e2lcovici, Vishnu Madav Ghatage and many others (85 in total).\n\nLudwig Prandtl (4 February 1875 \u2013 15 August 1953)[1] was a German fluid dynamicist, physicist and aerospace scientist.
