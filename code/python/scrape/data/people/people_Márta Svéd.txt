She was 75 years old when she completed her PhD in 1985. She wrote the textbook Journey into Geometries (1991), and won the BH Neumann Award in 1994 for her contributions to mathematics learning in Australia.\n M\u00e1rta Sv\u00e9d was in the same high school class in Budapest as Esther Klein.[1][2] She became interested in mathematics through K\u00f6z\u00e9piskolai Matematikai Lapok (K\u00f6MaL), a Hungarian magazine for high school mathematicians, and through its problem-solving column, where Paul Erd\u0151s was also a regular solver.[2][3]\n She took third place in her year's offering of the Hungarian national high school mathematics competition, ahead of P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n but behind her future husband, civil engineer George Sv\u00e9d.[2] Due to  the restrictions placed on Jews in Hungary in the late 1920s, only two students from their class could study science or mathematics at the university in Budapest; M\u00e1rta took the mathematics position, and Klein studied physics instead.[1]\n Sv\u00e9d and her husband moved to Australia in 1939 and had one son and one daughter. She became the head of the mathematics department at Wilderness School, a private Adelaide high school for girls, and in the same year helped found Australia's first high school mathematics magazine.[2]\n Her old friend Klein, meanwhile, had married mathematician George Szekeres and escaped Europe for Shanghai; after World War II, the Szekeres and Sv\u00e9d families shared a small apartment in Adelaide.[1]\n Sv\u00e9d died on 30 September 2005, two days after the death of her friends, George and Esther Szekeres, who died within an hour of each other.[4][5] She was interred at Centennial Park Cemetery, Pasadena, Mitcham City, South Australia.[6]\n In 1985, Sv\u00e9d completed a PhD at the University of Adelaide, at age 75.[2][7] Her dissertation, On finite linear and Baer structures, concerned finite geometry, and was supervised by Rey Casse.[2][7] Her 1991 book, Journey into Geometries (MAA Spectrum), has been described by reviewer David A. Thomas as an \"Alice-in-Wonderland-type journey into non-Euclidean geometry\", written in a conversational style.[8]\n Sv\u00e9d's posthumously-published book Two Lives and a Bonus (Peacock Publications, 2006) documents her early life in Budapest.[4]\n Sv\u00e9d won the BH Neumann Award of the Australian Mathematics Trust in 1994. The award citation credited her in particular for the flourishing of mathematics competitions in Australia and the success of Australia in international mathematics competitions.[2]\n The University of Adelaide offers a scholarship for women mathematicians named in memory of Sv\u00e9d.[9]\n ", "tags": ["2005 deaths", "Australian mathematicians", "Australian people of Hungarian-Jewish descent", "Hungarian Jews", "Hungarian mathematicians", "Women mathematicians", "University of Adelaide alumni", "University of Adelaide faculty", "Disease-related deaths in Australia", "CS1 maint: untitled periodical", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Year of birth uncertain", "Date of birth missing"], "raw": "Hungarian mathematician\nThe native form of this personal name is Sv\u00e9d M\u00e1rta.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nM\u00e1rta Sv\u00e9d (1909/1910 \u2013 30 September 2005) was a Hungarian mathematician who moved to Australia in the 1930s and became a teacher of mathematics at the University of Adelaide.
