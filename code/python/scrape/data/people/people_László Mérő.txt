He has Jewish ancestry.[1] He is a lecturer at the Experimental Psychology Department of E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University and at the business school K\u00fcrt Academy.[2] He is also a founder and leader of a software company producing computer games. One of his projects is a computer game he is developing with Ern\u0151 Rubik, the inventor of the Rubik's Cube. He is also the leader of the Hungarian team at the World Puzzle Championship. His son is Csaba M\u00e9r\u0151, 8 time Hungarian go champion.\n He represented Hungary in the Tenth International Mathematical Olympiad held in Moscow in 1968, and was awarded a Bronze Medal.[1][permanent dead link] He graduated from E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University with a degree in Mathematics in 1974. He spent the next ten years at the Computer and Automation Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, working on various pattern recognition and artificial intelligence projects. Recognizing the limitations of artificial intelligence, he began investigating human cognition. Since 1984 he has been at the Experimental Psychology Department of E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, studying cognitive psychology and psychophysics. \n He has written two books, Ways of Thinking (newer translation: Habits of Mind) and Moral Calculations, that aroused the interest of the wider, non-professional public. His books analyze the quasi-rational mechanisms of people and the nature of rationality in general, undermining some common beliefs about our minds' functioning.\n He has been publishing in Magyar Narancs a series titled Are you the dance instructor here? (The title refers to a joke: A client enters the dancing school and asks a well-dressed man: \"Are you the dance instructor here?\" \"Fuck no, I'm the etiquette instructor!\") Several of these essays were collected in a book in 2005 (see below).\n A lesser known book of his is Rubik's Puzzles\u00a0: The Ultimate Brain Teaser Book (March 2000, ISBN\u00a01-85868-790-X).\n His books (originally written in Hungarian) have been published in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Croatian. The Moral Calculations was awarded the second prize as the Scientific Book of the Year in Germany in 1999.\n ", "tags": ["Hungarian scientists", "1949 births", "Game theorists", "Living people", "International Mathematical Olympiad participants", "Hungarian people of Jewish descent", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Use mdy dates from April 2013", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2006", "All articles containing potentially dated statements", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThe native form of this personal name is M\u00e9r\u0151 L\u00e1szl\u00f3.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\n \nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 M\u00e9r\u0151 (born Budapest, December 11, 1949) is a Hungarian research psychologist and popular science author.
