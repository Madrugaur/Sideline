She has previously served in government as permanent secretary of the national policy of good governance.\n Born in December 1967, Ouedraogo was raised in Ouagadougou. She was drawn to the study of mathematics at a young age as she received good grades without putting forth much effort. She was educated at the University of Ouagadougou, where she wrote her first thesis (\u201cDoctorat de 3\u00e8me cycle) on Lie superalgebras in 1999.[1] Akry Koulibaly served as her doctoral adviser.[2] From 2005 to 2008 Ouedraogo served as the permanent secretary of the national policy of good governance. She was committed to ending forms of corruption, especially in the realm of public transport. According to her, good governance is a state of mind.[3] She then prepared a Ph.D. thesis at Blaise Pascal University of Clermont-Ferrand in France under the co-direction of Sylvie Paycha and Akry Koulibaly.[4] Her Ph.D. thesis was about pseudodifferential operators and was accepted in 2009.[1] Ouedraogo is the first Burkinab\u00e9 woman who defended a thesis in mathematics.\n Ouedraogo teaches in the Mathematics Department of the University of Ouagadougou.
