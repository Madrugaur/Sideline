He entered into a military academy at age 12 where he excelled as a young officer. In 1867, he entered the Alexandrovskoye Military High School in Moscow. Upon leaving Alexandrovskoye in 1870, he decided to go to the artillery branch and transferred to the Mikhailovskoye Artillery Academy. He graduated in 1875 and transferred to the Tula Arsenal where he became the head of the machining division.[1]\n It was at Tula where Mosin began his career as a weapons designer by first making improvements to the Berdan II and later collaborating with Nagant to design the Rifle of Three Lines of the Year 1891.[2] Some details in Mosin's rifle were borrowed from L\u00e9on Nagant's design. One such detail is the attachment of the magazine spring to the magazine base plate. In Mosin's original design the spring was not attached to the base plate and, according to the Commission, could be lost during cleaning. Another detail is the form of the clip that could hold five cartridges to be loaded simultaneously into the magazine. Another detail is the form of the \"interrupter\", a specially designed part within the receiver, which helps prevent double feeding. The initial rifle proposed by Mosin lacked an interrupter, leading to numerous failures to feed. This detail was introduced in the rifle borrowing from Nagant's rifle.\n Mosin eventually rose to the rank of Major General and was appointed as the director of the Sestroretsk arsenal.[3] He died on February 8, 1902 and was buried in Sestroretskoye Cemetery in St. Petersburg Sestroretsk.[4]\n ", "tags": ["1849 births", "1902 deaths", "People from Ramonsky District", "People from Voronezhsky Uyezd", "Russian military engineers", "Russian inventors", "Military personnel of the Russian Empire", "Weapon designers", "Firearm designers", "Pages using infobox military person with unknown parameters", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Sergei Ivanovich MosinNative name\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u0301\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041c\u043e\u0301\u0441\u0438\u043dBirth nameSergei Ivanovich MosinBorn(1849-04-14)April 14, 1849Ramon, Voronezh GovernorateDiedFebruary 8, 1902(1902-02-08) (aged\u00a052)Sestroretsk, RussiaAllegiance\u00a0Russian EmpireRankMajor GeneralSpouse(s)Varvara Nikolayevna Arsenyeva\nSergei Ivanovich Mosin (Russian: \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u0301\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041c\u043e\u0301\u0441\u0438\u043d, April 2 or 14, 1849 - February 8, 1902) was a Russian Major General, engineer, and the main contributor to the design of the 3-line rifle, Model 1891 (Russian: \"\u0442\u0440\u0451\u0445\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u0430 1891 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\"), colloquially known as Mosin\u2013Nagant. \n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Mosin\u2013Nagant\n3 See also\n4 References\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nMosin was born in Ramon, in the Voronezh Governorate of the Russian Empire in 1849.
