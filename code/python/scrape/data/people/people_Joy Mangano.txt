{"name": "Joy Mangano", "content": "\n Joy Mangano (/m\u00e6\u014b\u02c8\u0261\u00e6no\u028a/; born February 1, 1956)[1] is an American inventor and entrepreneur known for inventions such as the self-wringing Miracle Mop.[2][3] She was the president of Ingenious Designs, LLC, and appeared regularly on the U.S. television shopping channel HSN until her departure in late 2018.[4]\n Mangano released her autobiography, Inventing Joy, in 2017.  The 2015 film Joy was loosely based on her life.  Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Mangano.[5][6]\n Mangano was born in 1956, in East Meadow, New York, to Italian-American parents. Mangano began inventing at an early age when, as a teenager working at an animal hospital in Huntington, New York, on Long Island, she dreamed up a fluorescent flea collar to keep pets safe. A product with a similar design was released the next year by Hartz Mountain. After graduating from Pace University with a degree in business administration in 1978, she held a variety of jobs,[3] including waitress[2] and airline reservations manager while raising her three children as a divorced mother.[3]\n Mangano is a named inventor of 71 patent families and 126 distinct patent publications [7] for her inventions.[8] \"I think my products have been successful because they have mass appeal,\" she has said. \"I'm just like everybody else out there. I'm a mom, I work, I have a house to clean, things to organize. We all have similar needs, and I address them.\"\n In 1990 after growing frustrated with ordinary mops, Mangano developed her first invention, the Miracle Mop, a self-wringing plastic mop with a head made from a continuous loop of 300 feet (90 meters) of cotton that can be easily wrung out without getting the user's hands wet. With her own savings and investments from family and friends, she made a prototype and manufactured 1000 units.[9] Early assembly was done in her father's body shop in Peconic in 1991.\n After selling the mop at trade shows and in local stores on Long Island, she sold 1,000 units on consignment to QVC.[citation needed] It sold modestly at first, but once QVC allowed Mangano to go on-air to sell it herself, she sold 18,000 mops in less than a half hour.[1][10] Mangano incorporated her business as Arma Products, later renaming it Ingenious Designs. She sold Ingenious Designs to USA Networks, the parent company of the HSN, in 1999.[3]  By the year 2000, the company was selling $10 million worth of Miracle Mops per year.[3]\n Huggable Hangers \u2013 velvet-flocked, no-slip hangers whose thin profile conserves closet space.
