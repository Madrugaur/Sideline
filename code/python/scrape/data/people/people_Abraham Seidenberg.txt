{"name": "Abraham Seidenberg", "content": "Abraham Seidenberg (June 2, 1916 \u2013 May 3, 1988) was an American mathematician.\n Seidenberg was born on June 2, 1916 to Harry and Fannie Seidenberg in Washington D.C.. He graduated with a B.A. from the University of Maryland in 1937. He completed his Ph.D. in mathematics from Johns Hopkins University in 1943. His Ph.D. thesis, written under the direction of Oscar Zariski, was on Valuation Ideals in Rings of Polynomials in Two Variables.\n Seidenberg became an instructor in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley in 1945. He reached the rank of full professor in 1958. He retired from Berkeley in 1987.\n Seidenberg was known for his research in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, differential algebra, and the history of mathematics. He published Prime ideals and integral dependence written jointly with Irvin Cohen, which greatly simplified the existing proofs of the going-up and going-down theorems of ideal theory. He also made important contributions to algebraic geometry. In 1950, he published a paper called The hyperplane sections of normal varieties, which has proved fundamental in later advances. In 1968, he wrote Elements of the theory of algebraic curves, a book on algebraic geometry. He published several other important papers.\n Seidenberg married Ebe Cagli. She was a writer, and the sister of Yole Cagli, Zariski's wife. Ebe and her family immigrated to the United States from Italy. The couple frequently visited Italy and Seidenberg held a visiting professorship at the University of Milan.\n Seidenberg died on May 3, 1988, in Milan, Italy. At the time of his death, he was in the midst of series of lectures at the University of Milan.\n ", "tags": ["1916 births", "1988 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Historians of mathematics", "Johns Hopkins University alumni", "University of California, Berkeley faculty", "20th-century historians", "Mathematicians from Washington, D.C.", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nAbraham SeidenbergBorn(1916-06-02)June 2, 1916Washington D.C.DiedMay 3, 1988(1988-05-03) (aged\u00a071)Milan, ItalyNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materJohns Hopkins UniversityUniversity of MarylandKnown\u00a0forTarski\u2013Seidenberg theoremScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of California, BerkeleyThesisValuation Ideals in Rings of Polynomials in Two Variables\u00a0(1943)Doctoral advisorOscar Zariski\n\nAbraham Seidenberg (June 2, 1916 \u2013 May 3, 1988) was an American mathematician.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Academic career\n3 Contributions\n4 Personal life\n5 Death\n6 References\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nSeidenberg was born on June 2, 1916 to Harry and Fannie Seidenberg in Washington D.C..
