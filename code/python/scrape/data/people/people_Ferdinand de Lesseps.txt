{"name": "Ferdinand de Lesseps", "content": "Ferdinand Marie, vicomte de Lesseps GCSI (French:\u00a0[d\u0259 les\u025bps]; 19 November 1805 \u2013 7 December 1894) was a French diplomat and later developer of the Suez Canal, which in 1869 joined the Mediterranean and Red Seas, substantially reducing sailing distances and times between Europe and East Asia.\n He attempted to repeat this success with an effort to build a Panama Canal at sea level during the 1880s, but the project was devastated by epidemics of malaria and yellow fever in the area, as well as beset by financial problems, and the planned Lesseps Panama Canal was never completed. Eventually, the project was bought out by the United States, which solved the medical problems and changed the design to a non-sea level canal with locks. It was completed in 1914.[1]\n The origins of Lesseps' family are traceable back as far as the end of the 14th century. His ancestors, it is believed, came from Spain, and settled at Bayonne during the region's occupation by the English. One of his great-grandfathers, Pierre de Lesseps (Bayonne, 2 January 1690 \u2013 Bayonne, 20 August 1759), son of Bertrand Lesseps (1649\u20131708) and wife (m. 18 April 1675) Louise Fisson (1654\u20131690), was town clerk and at the same time secretary to Queen Maria Anna of Neuburg, widow of Charles II of Spain.\n From the middle of the 18th century the ancestors of Lesseps followed diplomatic careers, and he himself occupied several diplomatic posts from 1825 to 1849. His uncle was ennobled by King Louis XVI, and his father was made a count by Emperor Napoleon I. His father, Mathieu de Lesseps (Hamburg, 4 May 1774 \u2013 Tunis, 28 December 1832), was in the consular service; his mother, Catherine de Gr\u00e9vign\u00e9 (M\u00e1laga, 11 June 1774 \u2013 Paris, 27 January 1853), was Spanish on her mother's side, and aunt of the countess of Montijo, mother of the Empress Eug\u00e9nie. She was a daughter of Henri de Grevign\u00e9 (baptised Notre-Dame-aux-Fonts, Li\u00e8ge, 2 June 1744) and wife (m. M\u00e1laga, 1766) Francisca Antonia Gallegos (1751\u20131853).\n Ferdinand de Lesseps was born November 19, 1805 in Versailles, Yvelines. He had a sister, Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Lesseps (1803\u20131879), married to Jules Tallien de Cabarrus (19 April 1801 \u2013 1870), and two brothers, Th\u00e9odore de Lesseps (C\u00e1diz, 25 September 1802 \u2013 Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 20 May 1874), married in 1828 to Antonia Denois (Paris, 27 September 1802 \u2013 Paris, 29 December 1878), and Jules de Lesseps (Pisa, 16 February 1809 \u2013 Paris, 10 October 1887), married on 11 March 1874 to Hyacinthe Delarue.\n His first years were spent in Italy, where his father was occupied with his consular duties. He was educated at the College of Henry IV in Paris. From the age of 18 years to 20 he was employed in the commissary department of the army. From 1825 to 1827 he acted as assistant vice-consul at Lisbon, where his uncle, Barth\u00e9lemy de Lesseps, was the French charg\u00e9 d'affaires. This uncle was an old companion of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La P\u00e9rouse and the only survivor of the expedition in which La P\u00e9rouse perished. Barth\u00e9lemy de Lesseps had left the expedition in Kamchatka to travel to St Petersburg overland.\n In 1828 Lesseps was sent as an assistant vice-consul to Tunis, where his father was consul-general. He aided the escape of Youssouff, pursued by the soldiers of the Bey, of whom he was one of the officers, for violation of the seraglio law. Youssouff acknowledged this protection given by a Frenchman by distinguishing himself in the ranks of the French army at the time of the French conquest of Algeria. Lesseps was also entrusted by his father with missions to Marshal Count Bertrand Clausel, general-in-chief of the army of occupation in Algeria. The marshal wrote to Mathieu de Lesseps on 18 December 1830: \"I have had the pleasure of meeting your son, who gives promise of sustaining with great credit the name he bears.\"\n In 1832 Lesseps was appointed vice-consul at Alexandria. While the vessel, in which Lesseps sailed to Egypt, was in quarantine at the Alexandrian lazaretto, M. Mimaut, consul-general of France at Alexandria, sent him several books, among which was the memoir written upon the previously filled and abandoned Ancient Suez Canal, according to Napoleon Bonaparte's instructions, by the civil engineer Jacques-Marie Le P\u00e8re, one of the scientific members of the French expedition.\n This work struck Lesseps's imagination, and was one of the influences that gave him the idea of constructing a canal across the African isthmus. Fortunately for Lesseps, Muhammad Ali, the viceroy of Egypt, owed his position in part to the recommendations made on his behalf to the French government by Mathieu de Lesseps, who was consul-general in Egypt when Ali was a colonel. Because of this, Lesseps received a warm welcome from the viceroy and became good friends with his son, Said Pasha. Politically, the British were allied with the Ottoman capital in Istanbul\u2014to prevent the Russians from Black Sea access to the Mediterranean Sea\u2014and had also repelled Ali's attempt to invade the Ottoman capital in 1833. The French were able to manoeuvre in Egypt under Ali's graces by playing off the British aggression against Ali in Istanbul.[2]\n In 1833 Lesseps was sent as consul to Cairo, and soon afterwards given the management of the consulate general at Alexandria, a post that he held until 1837. While in Egypt he encountered and was influenced by Barth\u00e9lemy Prosper Enfantin, who was working on a dam north of Cairo for Ali while preaching for a union of the Mediterranean and Red Seas.[3] While he was there an epidemic of plague broke out and lasted for two years, resulting in the deaths of more than a third of the inhabitants of Cairo and Alexandria. During this time Lesseps went from one city to the other with zeal and energy. Towards the close of the year 1837 he returned to France, and on 21 December married Agathe Delamalle (1819\u20131853), daughter of the government prosecuting attorney at the court of Angers. By this marriage de Lesseps became the father of five sons: Charles Th\u00e9odore de Lesseps (1838\u20131838), Charles Aim\u00e9 de Lesseps (1840\u20131923), Ferdinand Marie de Lesseps (1842\u20131846), Ferdinand Victor de Lesseps (1847\u20131853) and Aim\u00e9 Victor de Lesseps (1848\u20131896).\n In 1839 Lesseps was appointed consul at Rotterdam, and in the following year transferred to M\u00e1laga, the ancestral home of his mother's family. In 1842 he was sent to Barcelona, and soon afterwards promoted to the grade of consul general. In the course of a bloody insurrection in Catalonia, which ended in the bombardment of Barcelona, de Lesseps offered protection to a number of men threatened by the fighting regardless of their factional sympathies or nationalities. From 1848 to 1849 he was minister of France at Madrid.\n In 1849 the government of the French Republic sent Lesseps to Rome to negotiate the return of Pope Pius IX to the Vatican. He tried to negotiate an agreement whereby Pope Pius could return peacefully to the Vatican but also ensuring the continued independence of Rome. But, during negotiations, the elections in France caused a change in the foreign policy of the government \u2013 Alexis de Tocqueville replaced the previous foreign minister. Lesseps course was disapproved; he was recalled and brought before the Council of State. Louis-Napoleon needed a scapegoat and Lesseps was an easy target. Lesseps was accused of causing dishonor to the French army and was censured although he was not told to leave the Foreign Ministry.[4]\n Lesseps was created on 30 August 1851 the 334th Commander and then the 200th Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword.\n Lesseps then retired from the diplomatic service, and never again occupied any public office. In 1853 he lost his wife and his son Ferdinand Victor at a few days' interval. In 1854, the accession to the viceroyalty of Egypt of Said Pasha gave Lesseps a new impulse to act upon the creation of a Suez Canal.\n Lesseps had corresponded at least once with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tudes du Canal de Suez during the reign of Abbas I in Egypt, but Abbas had closed off most of Egypt to foreign influence. Upon Abbas' assassination in 1854, Lesseps, made inquiries with a former, if short-term, acquaintance and successor in Egypt, Said Pasha. On 7 November 1854 he landed at Alexandria; on the 30th of the same month Said Pasha signed the concession authorizing him to build the Suez Canal.[5]\n A first scheme, initiated by Lesseps, was immediately drawn out by two French engineers who were in the Egyptian service, Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds called \"Linant Bey\" and Mougel Bey. This project, differing from others that were previously presented or that were in opposition to it, provided for a direct link between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. After being slightly modified, the plan was adopted in 1856 by the civil engineers constituting the International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez. Encouraged by the engineers' approval, Lesseps no longer allowed anything to stop him. He listened to no adverse criticism and receded before no obstacle. Neither the opposition of Lord Palmerston, who considered the projected disturbance as too radical and a danger to the commercial position of Great Britain. Lesseps was similarly not deterred by the opinions entertained, in France as well as in England, that the sea in front of Port Said was full of mud which would obstruct the entrance to the canal, and that the sands from the desert would fill the trenches.\n Lesseps succeeded in rousing the patriotism of the French and obtaining by their subscriptions more than half of the capital of two hundred million francs which he needed in order to form a company, but could not attract any substantial capital contribution from the public in England or other foreign countries. The Egyptian government thus subscribed for eighty million francs worth of shares.\n The Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez was organized at the end of 1858. On 25 April 1859 the first blow of the pickaxe was given by Lesseps at Port Said. During the following ten years, Lesseps had to overcome the continuing opposition of the British government preventing the Sultan from approving the construction of the canal, and at one stage he even had to seek the support of his cousin, Empress Eugenie, to persuade the Emperor Napoleon III to act as arbitrator in the disputes. Finally, on 17 November 1869, the canal was officially opened by the Khedive, Ismail Pasha.\n While in the interests of his canal Lesseps resisted the opposition of British diplomacy to an enterprise which threatened to give France control of the shortest route to India, he acted loyally towards Great Britain after Disraeli acquired the Suez shares belonging to the Khedive, by admitting to the board of directors of the company three representatives of the British government. The consolidation of interests which resulted, and which was strengthened by the addition in 1884 of seven more British directors, chosen from among shipping merchants and business men, increased, for the benefit of all concerned, the commercial character of the enterprise.\n Lesseps steadily endeavored to keep out of politics. If in 1869 he appeared to deviate from this principle by being a candidate at Marseille for the Corps L\u00e9gislatif, it was because he yielded to the entreaties of the Imperial government in order to strengthen its goodwill for the Suez Canal. Once this goodwill had been shown, he bore no malice towards those who rendered him his liberty by preferring L\u00e9on Gambetta. Afterward, Lesseps declined the other candidatures that were offered to him: for the Senate in 1876, and for the Chamber in 1877. In 1873 he became interested in a project for uniting Europe and Asia by a railway to Mumbai, with a branch to Beijing. The same year, he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He subsequently encouraged Major Roudaire, who wished to transform a stretch of the Sahara into an inland sea to increase rainfall in Algeria.[6]\n Lesseps accepted the presidency of the French committee of Leopold II of Belgium's International African Society.  From this position he facilitated Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza's explorations, and acquired stations that Brazza subsequently abandoned to the French government. These stations were the starting-point of French Congo. Lesseps was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1879.[7]\n From 17 November 1899 to 23 December 1956, a monumental statue of Ferdinand de Lesseps by Emmanuel Fr\u00e9miet stood at the entrance of the Suez Canal.[8][9]\n In May 1879 a congress of 136 delegates (including Lesseps) assembled in the rooms of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de g\u00e9ographie in Paris, under the presidency of Admiral de la Roncire le Noury, and voted in favor of the creation of a Panama Canal, which was to be without locks, like the Suez Canal. Lesseps was appointed President of the Panama Canal Company, despite the fact that he had reached the age of 74. It was on this occasion that Gambetta bestowed upon him the title of \"Le Grand Fran\u00e7ais\". However, the decision to dig a Panama Canal at sea level to avoid the use of locks, and the inability of contemporary medical science to deal with epidemics of malaria and yellow fever, doomed the project.\n In February 1880, Lesseps arrived in New York City to raise money for the project. When he stayed at the Windsor Hotel, its staff flew the French flag in his honor. He met the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Geographic Society while touring the area. Lesseps then went to Washington D.C., met with President Rutherford B. Hayes, and testified to the House Interoceanic Canal Committee. He later went to Boston, Chicago, and several other American cities to raise interest and capital for the project.[10]\n In June 1880, Lesseps gave a speech in Liverpool where he was able to find support from a Captain Peacock, who felt the canal project was worth supporting as it would provide routes to save time.[11]\n Lesseps went with his youngest child to Panama to see the planned pathway. He estimated in 1880 that the project would take 658 million francs and eight years to complete. After two years of surveys, work on the canal began in 1882. However, the technical difficulties of operating in the wet tropics dogged the project. Particularly disastrous were recurrent landslides into the excavations from the bordering water-saturated hills, and the death toll from malaria and yellow fever. In the end, insufficient financial capital and financial corruption ended the project. The Panama Canal Company declared itself bankrupt in December 1888 and entered liquidation in February 1889.\n The failure of the project is sometimes referred to as the Panama Canal Scandal, after rumors circulated that French politicians and journalists had received bribes. By 1892 it emerged that 150 French deputies had been bribed into voting for the allocation of financial aid to the Panama Canal Company, and in February 1893 Lesseps, his son Charles (born 1849), and a number of others faced trial and were found guilty. Lesseps was ordered to pay a fine and serve a prison sentence, but the latter was overturned by the Court of Cassation on the grounds that it had been more than three years since the crime was committed. Ultimately, in 1904 the United States bought out the assets of the Company and resumed work under a revised plan.\n In Paris on November 25, 1869\u2014a week after the opening of the Suez Canal\u2014Lesseps married his second wife, who was a third his age. Louise-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Autard de Bragard was born on the island of Mauritius in 1848 at Plaines Wilhems and died on 29 January 1909 at Ch\u00e2teau de La Chesnay in Guilly, Vatan, Indre. \nShe was the daughter of Gustave Adolphe Autard de Bragard, a former Magistrate of Mauritius, and wife Marie-Louise Carcenac (1817\u20131857), daughter of Pierre Carcenac (1771\u20131819) and wife Marie Fran\u00e7oise Dessachis.  Eleven of her twelve children (six boys and six girls) with Lesseps survived their father:\n On 11 June 1884, Levi P. Morton, the Minister of the United States to France, gave a banquet in honor of the Franco-American Union and in celebration of the completion of the Statue of Liberty. Ferdinand de Lesseps, as head of the Franco-American Union, formally presented the statue to the United States, saying:\n This is the result of the devoted enthusiasm, the intelligence and the noblest sentiments which can inspire man. It is great in its conception, great in its execution, great in its proportions; let us hope that it will add, by its moral value, to the memories and sympathies that it is intended to perpetuate. We now transfer to you, Mr. Minister, this great statue and trust that it may forever stand the pledge of friendship between France and the Great Republic of the United States. In October 1886, Lesseps traveled to the United States to speak at the dedication ceremony of the Statue of Liberty on the date of the 28th, and attended by President Grover Cleveland.\n Lesseps died at Ch\u00e2teau de La Chesnaye in Guilly, Vatan, Indre, on 7 December 1894. He was buried in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.[12] The grave stands at one of the junctions amongst other large family tombs.\n In 1956 Egyptian President Gamal Nasser used his name in a radio speech, as the codeword to his army to raid the Suez Canal Company's offices on 26 July 1956. This was the first step to the Suez Canal's nationalization. In the course of the raid and seizure of the canal by Egypt, the statue of Lesseps at the entrance of the Suez Canal was removed from its pedestal, to symbolize the end of European ownership of the waterway. The statue now stands in a small garden of the Port Fuad shipyard.\n Lesseps was portrayed by Tyrone Power in the 1938 film Suez, with Loretta Young, a film which provoked complaints and legal action from Lesseps' family and the Egyptian government.[13]\n In addition, Manuel Soto played the part in a 1944 Spanish feature film, Eugenia de Montijo.  On television, Guy Marchand played Lesseps in the 1983 French/German mini-series L'homme de Suez, and John Walters portrayed him in \"The Panama Canal\", an episode of the 2003 BBC docu-drama series Seven Wonders of the Industrial World.[14]\n Lesseps appears as a great engineer in the game Civilization V.\n Lesseps is also discussed extensively in the David McCullough book, The Path Between the Seas.\n ", "tags": ["1805 births", "1894 deaths", "People from Versailles", "Burials at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery", "De Lesseps family", "19th-century French diplomats", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "French businesspeople", "Grand Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur", "Honorary Knights Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise", "People of the Revolutions of 1848", "Suez Canal", "Panama Canal", "French canal engineers", "French expatriates in Egypt", "French expatriates in Italy", "French expatriates in Portugal", "French expatriates in Tunisia", "French expatriates in the Netherlands", "French expatriates in Spain", "Harv and Sfn no-target errors", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2019", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Pages with missing ISBNs", "Articles needing additional references from September 2017", "All articles needing additional references", "Biography with signature", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Open Library ID different from Wikidata", "Articles with Open Library links", "Articles with LibriVox links", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.

Lesseps course was disapproved; he was recalled and brought before the Council of State. Louis-Napoleon needed a scapegoat and Lesseps was an easy target. Lesseps was accused of causing dishonor to the French army and was censured although he was not told to leave the Foreign Ministry.[4]\nLesseps was created on 30 August 1851 the 334th Commander and then the 200th Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword.\nLesseps then retired from the diplomatic service, and never again occupied any public office. In 1853 he lost his wife and his son Ferdinand Victor at a few days' interval. In 1854, the accession to the viceroyalty of Egypt of Said Pasha gave Lesseps a new impulse to act upon the creation of a Suez Canal.\n\nSuez Canal[edit]\n Caricature of de Lesseps by Andr\u00e9 Gill, 1867.\n Lesseps' statue at the entrance of the Suez Canal, 1955; the outstretched hand indicated that the way was now open to the East.\n Lesseps' statue displayed today in front of the Suez Canal International Museum in Ismailia.\nLesseps had corresponded at least once with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tudes du Canal de Suez during the reign of Abbas I in Egypt, but Abbas had closed off most of Egypt to foreign influence. Upon Abbas' assassination in 1854, Lesseps, made inquiries with a former, if short-term, acquaintance and successor in Egypt, Said Pasha. On 7 November 1854 he landed at Alexandria; on the 30th of the same month Said Pasha signed the concession authorizing him to build the Suez Canal.[5]\nA first scheme, initiated by Lesseps, was immediately drawn out by two French engineers who were in the Egyptian service, Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds called \"Linant Bey\" and Mougel Bey. This project, differing from others that were previously presented or that were in opposition to it, provided for a direct link between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. After being slightly modified, the plan was adopted in 1856 by the civil engineers constituting the International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez. Encouraged by the engineers' approval, Lesseps no longer allowed anything to stop him. He listened to no adverse criticism and receded before no obstacle. Neither the opposition of Lord Palmerston, who considered the projected disturbance as too radical and a danger to the commercial position of Great Britain. Lesseps was similarly not deterred by the opinions entertained, in France as well as in England, that the sea in front of Port Said was full of mud which would obstruct the entrance to the canal, and that the sands from the desert would fill the trenches.\nLesseps succeeded in rousing the patriotism of the French and obtaining by their subscriptions more than half of the capital of two hundred million francs which he needed in order to form a company, but could not attract any substantial capital contribution from the public in England or other foreign countries. The Egyptian government thus subscribed for eighty million francs worth of shares.\nThe Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez was organized at the end of 1858. On 25 April 1859 the first blow of the pickaxe was given by Lesseps at Port Said. During the following ten years, Lesseps had to overcome the continuing opposition of the British government preventing the Sultan from approving the construction of the canal, and at one stage he even had to seek the support of his cousin, Empress Eugenie, to persuade the Emperor Napoleon III to act as arbitrator in the disputes. Finally, on 17 November 1869, the canal was officially opened by the Khedive, Ismail Pasha.\n\n Ferdinand de Lesseps' house and office in Ismailia, near the Suez Canal\nWhile in the interests of his canal Lesseps resisted the opposition of British diplomacy to an enterprise which threatened to give France control of the shortest route to India, he acted loyally towards Great Britain after Disraeli acquired the Suez shares belonging to the Khedive, by admitting to the board of directors of the company three representatives of the British government. The consolidation of interests which resulted, and which was strengthened by the addition in 1884 of seven more British directors, chosen from among shipping merchants and business men, increased, for the benefit of all concerned, the commercial character of the enterprise.\nLesseps steadily endeavored to keep out of politics. If in 1869 he appeared to deviate from this principle by being a candidate at Marseille for the Corps L\u00e9gislatif, it was because he yielded to the entreaties of the Imperial government in order to strengthen its goodwill for the Suez Canal. Once this goodwill had been shown, he bore no malice towards those who rendered him his liberty by preferring L\u00e9on Gambetta. Afterward, Lesseps declined the other candidatures that were offered to him: for the Senate in 1876, and for the Chamber in 1877. In 1873 he became interested in a project for uniting Europe and Asia by a railway to Mumbai, with a branch to Beijing. The same year, he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He subsequently encouraged Major Roudaire, who wished to transform a stretch of the Sahara into an inland sea to increase rainfall in Algeria.[6]\nLesseps accepted the presidency of the French committee of Leopold II of Belgium's International African Society.  From this position he facilitated Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza's explorations, and acquired stations that Brazza subsequently abandoned to the French government. These stations were the starting-point of French Congo. Lesseps was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1879.[7]\nFrom 17 November 1899 to 23 December 1956, a monumental statue of Ferdinand de Lesseps by Emmanuel Fr\u00e9miet stood at the entrance of the Suez Canal.[8][9]\n\nPanama Canal attempt[edit]\n \n Share of the Compagnie Universelle du Canal Interoc\u00e9anique de Panama, issued 29. November 1880 \u2013 signed by Ferdinand de Lesseps\nIn May 1879 a congress of 136 delegates (including Lesseps) assembled in the rooms of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de g\u00e9ographie in Paris, under the presidency of Admiral de la Roncire le Noury, and voted in favor of the creation of a Panama Canal, which was to be without locks, like the Suez Canal. Lesseps was appointed President of the Panama Canal Company, despite the fact that he had reached the age of 74. It was on this occasion that Gambetta bestowed upon him the title of \"Le Grand Fran\u00e7ais\". However, the decision to dig a Panama Canal at sea level to avoid the use of locks, and the inability of contemporary medical science to deal with epidemics of malaria and yellow fever, doomed the project.\n\n Piercing of the Isthmus of Panama, medal by Louis-Oscar Roty\nIn February 1880, Lesseps arrived in New York City to raise money for the project. When he stayed at the Windsor Hotel, its staff flew the French flag in his honor. He met the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Geographic Society while touring the area. Lesseps then went to Washington D.C., met with President Rutherford B. Hayes, and testified to the House Interoceanic Canal Committee. He later went to Boston, Chicago, and several other American cities to raise interest and capital for the project.[10]\nIn June 1880, Lesseps gave a speech in Liverpool where he was able to find support from a Captain Peacock, who felt the canal project was worth supporting as it would provide routes to save time.[11]\nLesseps went with his youngest child to Panama to see the planned pathway. He estimated in 1880 that the project would take 658 million francs and eight years to complete. After two years of surveys, work on the canal began in 1882. However, the technical difficulties of operating in the wet tropics dogged the project. Particularly disastrous were recurrent landslides into the excavations from the bordering water-saturated hills, and the death toll from malaria and yellow fever. In the end, insufficient financial capital and financial corruption ended the project. The Panama Canal Company declared itself bankrupt in December 1888 and entered liquidation in February 1889.\nThe failure of the project is sometimes referred to as the Panama Canal Scandal, after rumors circulated that French politicians and journalists had received bribes. By 1892 it emerged that 150 French deputies had been bribed into voting for the allocation of financial aid to the Panama Canal Company, and in February 1893 Lesseps, his son Charles (born 1849), and a number of others faced trial and were found guilty. Lesseps was ordered to pay a fine and serve a prison sentence, but the latter was overturned by the Court of Cassation on the grounds that it had been more than three years since the crime was committed. Ultimately, in 1904 the United States bought out the assets of the Company and resumed work under a revised plan.\n\nSecond marriage and issue[edit]\nIn Paris on November 25, 1869\u2014a week after the opening of the Suez Canal\u2014Lesseps married his second wife, who was a third his age. Louise-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Autard de Bragard was born on the island of Mauritius in 1848 at Plaines Wilhems and died on 29 January 1909 at Ch\u00e2teau de La Chesnay in Guilly, Vatan, Indre. \nShe was the daughter of Gustave Adolphe Autard de Bragard, a former Magistrate of Mauritius, and wife Marie-Louise Carcenac (1817\u20131857), daughter of Pierre Carcenac (1771\u20131819) and wife Marie Fran\u00e7oise Dessachis.

Morton, the Minister of the United States to France, gave a banquet in honor of the Franco-American Union and in celebration of the completion of the Statue of Liberty. Ferdinand de Lesseps, as head of the Franco-American Union, formally presented the statue to the United States, saying:\n\nThis is the result of the devoted enthusiasm, the intelligence and the noblest sentiments which can inspire man. It is great in its conception, great in its execution, great in its proportions; let us hope that it will add, by its moral value, to the memories and sympathies that it is intended to perpetuate. We now transfer to you, Mr. Minister, this great statue and trust that it may forever stand the pledge of friendship between France and the Great Republic of the United States.\nIn October 1886, Lesseps traveled to the United States to speak at the dedication ceremony of the Statue of Liberty on the date of the 28th, and attended by President Grover Cleveland.\n\nDeath[edit]\n The grave of Ferdinand de Lesseps, P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris\nLesseps died at Ch\u00e2teau de La Chesnaye in Guilly, Vatan, Indre, on 7 December 1894. He was buried in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.[12] The grave stands at one of the junctions amongst other large family tombs.\n\nLegacy[edit]\nIn 1956 Egyptian President Gamal Nasser used his name in a radio speech, as the codeword to his army to raid the Suez Canal Company's offices on 26 July 1956. This was the first step to the Suez Canal's nationalization. In the course of the raid and seizure of the canal by Egypt, the statue of Lesseps at the entrance of the Suez Canal was removed from its pedestal, to symbolize the end of European ownership of the waterway. The statue now stands in a small garden of the Port Fuad shipyard.\n\nIn popular culture[edit]\nLesseps was portrayed by Tyrone Power in the 1938 film Suez, with Loretta Young, a film which provoked complaints and legal action from Lesseps' family and the Egyptian government.[13]\nIn addition, Manuel Soto played the part in a 1944 Spanish feature film, Eugenia de Montijo.  On television, Guy Marchand played Lesseps in the 1983 French/German mini-series L'homme de Suez, and John Walters portrayed him in \"The Panama Canal\", an episode of the 2003 BBC docu-drama series Seven Wonders of the Industrial World.[14]\nLesseps appears as a great engineer in the game Civilization V.\nLesseps is also discussed extensively in the David McCullough book, The Path Between the Seas.\n\nSee also[edit]\nLesseps metro station in the Barcelona Metro\nFort De Lesseps, a U.S. military base in Panama was named in his honor\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ McCullough 1977. sfn error: no target: CITEREFMcCullough1977 (help)\n\n^ Karabell, Zachary (2003).
