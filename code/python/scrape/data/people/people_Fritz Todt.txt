{"name": "Fritz Todt", "content": "\n Fritz Todt (4 September 1891 \u2013 8 February 1942) was a German construction engineer and senior Nazi, who rose from the position of \"Inspector General for German Roadways\", where he directed the construction of the German Autobahns (Reichsautobahnen), to become the Reich Minister for Armaments and Ammunition. From that position he directed the entire German wartime military economy. At the beginning of World War II he initiated what Hitler named Organisation Todt, a military-engineering company, which supplied industry with forced labor and administered construction of the Nazi concentration camps in the late phase of Nazi Germany. Todt died in an aircraft crash in 1942.\n Todt was born in Pforzheim in the Grand Duchy of Baden, today's Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg to Emil Todt (1861\u20131909) and his wife Elise n\u00e9e Unterecker (1869\u20131935). His father owned a small ring factory. \nDuring 1910, he volunteered for one-year military service.\nFrom 1911 to 1914, Todt studied engineering at Technical University of Munich and at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, graduating with a Diplom degree in construction engineering from the latter.[1]\n During World War I, he served initially with the infantry and then as front line reconnaissance observer within the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte (the German Air Forces \u2013 DLSK), winning the Iron Cross. After the war he resumed his studies, graduating during 1920.[1]\n During 1921 he initially worked on waterpower stations for the Gr\u00fcn & Bilfinger AG, Mannheim company and, later during 1921, the civil engineering company Sager & Woerner\u00a0[de] and worked there until 1933.[1] On 5 January 1922, he joined the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), or \"Nazi Party\". In 1931, he became an Oberf\u00fchrer (senior Colonel) in the Sturmabteilung (SA), which was then commanded by Ernst R\u00f6hm. During 1932, Todt completed his thesis at Technical University of Munich \"Fehlerquellen beim Bau von Landstra\u00dfendecken aus Teer und Asphalt\" \u2013 \"Sources of defects in the construction of tarmac and asphalt road surfaces\" and became a Doctor of Engineering (Dr.-Ing.).[1]\n In July 1933, five months after Hitler became Reichskanzler, Todt was appointed \"Inspector General for German Roadways\" (Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen). This public authority (Oberste Reichsbeh\u00f6rde) was privileged to be outside the hierarchy of Reich Ministries; Todt was subordinated directly to Hitler.[1] Alan S. Milward characterized this phase as follows:\n\"His personal views on business questions and, what was more important, the success of the motorway project kept Todt in the inner circle of the F\u00fchrer. At the same time, his deliberate pose as a technical expert, as a man without interest in internal power struggles, saved him from the adversaries of the more important party leaders for a long time. \"[2]:44\nHe was given the task of organizing a new construction company for the motorways (Reichsautobahnen).[3] He edited the journal Die Strasse, which was a publication of his agency from 1934 to 1942.[4] \nFor his work on the autobahnen, Todt was recognized with the German National Prize for Art and Science by Hitler, next to Ernst Heinkel, Ferdinand Porsche and Willy Messerschmitt.[1] Hitler donated the award during 1937, devised as a replacement for the Nobel Prize, which Hitler forbade Germans from accepting starting during 1936.[citation needed]\n In 1938, he became Leiter des Hauptamts f\u00fcr Technik in der Reichsleitung der NSDAP (\"Director of the Head Office for Engineering in the National Directorate of the NSDAP\") and during December Generalbevollm\u00e4chtigter f\u00fcr die Regelung der Bauwirtschaft (\"General Commissioner for the Regulation of the Construction Industry\"). At the beginning of World War II in Europe, he was also appointed to the rank of Generalmajor of the Luftwaffe.[1] During May 1938, he initiated the Organisation Todt (OT), joining together government firms, private companies and the Reichsarbeitsdienst (Reich Labour Service).[1] OT used up to 800,000 forced laborers (Zwangsarbeiter) from countries Germany occupied during World War II.[1] Todt was responsible for the construction of the \"West Wall\" (commonly named the \"Siegfried Line\" in English-speaking countries) to defend the Reich territory.\n On 17 March 1940, Todt was appointed Reichsminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition (\"Minister for Armaments and Munitions\") which meant he managed the entire military economy.[1]\n After the invasion of the USSR during June 1941, Todt was appointed to manage the restoration of the infrastructure there. At the end of July 1941 he was named Inspector General for water and energy. During that year, he became increasingly distant from the commanders of the Wehrmacht and in particular, from Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring, the Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe (Commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe).[1] After an inspection tour of the Eastern Front, Todt complained to Hitler that without better equipment and supplies for the armed forces it would be better to end the war with the Soviet Union.[1] Hitler rejected such an assessment and continued the offensive against the Soviets.\n Todt was married and had three daughters and one son.\n On the occasion of his 50th birthday in 1941, he founded the  Dr. Fritz Todt Foundation. The goal of the organisation was to promote young talents of technicians, especially young people from poor families by a training subsidy.\n On 8 February 1942, soon after takeoff from the Wolfsschanze (\"Wolf's Lair\") airfield near Rastenburg in East Prussia, Todt's aircraft crashed.[1] He was buried in the Invalids' Cemetery in the Scharnhorst-Strasse in Berlin. Posthumously, he became the first recipient of the newly created Deutscher Orden (\"German Order\"),[1] the highest award the Nazi Party could bestow on a person for \"duties of the highest order to the state and party\".[citation needed]\n It has been suggested that Todt was the victim of an assassination orchestrated by Hitler, but that has never been confirmed.[5][6] Todt's successor as Reichsminister was Albert Speer, whom Hitler awarded an Org.Todt ring during May 1943. Speer mentioned the Reich Air Ministry enquiry into the airplane accident, which he said ended with the sentence: \"The possibility of sabotage is ruled out. Further measures are therefore neither requisite nor intended\". Speer, who was present and had declined to ride on the same flight, thought that the wording was \"curious\".[7]:279\n On 8 February 1944, the second anniversary of Todt's death, Hitler awarded the Dr.-Fritz-Todt-Preis as a Badge of Honor of the Nazi Party for \"Innovative accomplishments, which are of great importance for the Volk community because of the improvement of their weapons, ammunition and military equipment, and the saving of labor, raw materials and energy\". The Badge of Honor came with a material prize and a certificate, was awarded as a medal made of gold, silver, or steel. The Golden Award of Honor was presented by Hitler in person upon proposal by the responsible Gauleiter, upon the joint proposal of Robert Ley, the director of the corresponding Deutsche Arbeitsfront and NSDAP leaders, and the director of the \"Main office for Technology in the NSDAP\", Albert Speer.[8]\n ", "tags": ["1891 births", "1942 deaths", "People from Pforzheim", "People from the Grand Duchy of Baden", "20th-century German architects", "German civil engineers", "Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte personnel", "Sturmabteilung officers", "Holocaust perpetrators", "Architects in the Nazi Party", "Nazi Germany ministers", "Nazi Party officials", "Major generals of the Luftwaffe", "Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in Poland", "Werner von Siemens Ring laureates", "Burials at the Invalids' Cemetery", "Technical University of Munich alumni", "Prussian Army personnel", "Recipients of the Iron Cross (1914)", "Recipients of the German Order (decoration)", "Engineers from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from March 2013", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from July 2017", "Articles needing additional references from July 2020", "All articles needing additional references", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German engineer and senior Nazi figure\n\n\nFritz TodtReich Minister Todt March 1940Reich Minister for Armaments and AmmunitionIn office17 March 1940\u00a0\u2013 8 February 1942LeaderAdolf Hitler (F\u00fchrer)Preceded byPosition establishedSucceeded byAlbert Speer\nPersonal detailsBorn(1891-09-04)4 September 1891Pforzheim, Grand Duchy of Baden, German EmpireDied8 February 1942(1942-02-08) (aged\u00a050)near Rastenburg, Province of East PrussiaNazi GermanyResting placeInvalids' Cemetery, BerlinPolitical partyNazi PartyParentsEmil Todt (father)Elise Unterecker (mother)EducationConstruction engineeringAlma materTechnical University of Munich and Karlsruhe Institute of TechnologyProfessionCivil engineerKnown forChief of Organisation TodtCabinetHitler CabinetCivilian awardsGerman OrderMilitary serviceAllegiance\u00a0German EmpireBranch/serviceLuftstreitkr\u00e4fteYears\u00a0of service1914\u20131918RankLieutenant of the reserveBattles/warsWorld War IMilitary awardsIron Cross\nFritz Todt (4 September 1891 \u2013 8 February 1942) was a German construction engineer and senior Nazi, who rose from the position of \"Inspector General for German Roadways\", where he directed the construction of the German Autobahns (Reichsautobahnen), to become the Reich Minister for Armaments and Ammunition.
