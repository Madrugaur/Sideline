{"name": "Ricardo Bofill", "content": "Ricardo Bofill Lev\u00ed (Catalan:\u00a0[ri\u02c8ka\u027e\u00f0u bu\u02c8fi\u028e l\u0259\u02c8\u03b2i]; born 5 December 1939) is a Spanish architect. He founded Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura in 1963 and developed it into a leading international architectural and urban design practice. According to architectural historian Andrew Ayers, his creations rank \"among the most impressive buildings of the 20th century.\"[1]\n Born in late 1939 just after the end of the Spanish Civil War, Ricardo Bofill grew up in a well-to-do family with deep Catalan and Barcelonese roots. His grandfather Josep Maria Bofill i Pichot\u00a0[ca] (1860-1938) had been involved in prominent local institutions such as the Institute for Catalan Studies, the Catalan Institute of Natural History\u00a0[ca], and the Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Barcelona\u00a0[ca]. His father Emilio Bofill (1907-2000) was an architect, builder and developer who studied at Escola T\u00e8cnica Superior d'Arquitectura de Barcelona\u00a0[ca], Catalonia's oldest professional architecture school. Ricardo Bofill would later describe him as \"republican, liberal, progressive, austere and logical.\"[2] Ricardo's mother, Maria Levi (1909-1991), was an Italian of Jewish descent born in Venice, who became a prominent sponsor of Catalan literature and culture in postwar Barcelona.[3]\n Bofill studied at the Lyc\u00e9e fran\u00e7ais de Barcelone. He spent much of his youth traveling, first with his family and later on his own, and developed a passion for vernacular architecture.[4] His first project was a summer home in Ibiza, completed in 1960.[5] That year he enrolled at the Escola T\u00e8cnica Superior d'Arquitectura de Barcelona\u00a0[ca], where he engaged in student activism with the unauthorized Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia. In 1958 he was arrested in a demonstration and expelled from the university and from Spain.[citation needed] He moved to Switzerland and completed his formal architectural training at the Haute \u00c9cole d'art et de design Gen\u00e8ve\u00a0[fr].\n In 1963, Ricardo Bofill and a group of close friends created Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura (Ricardo Bofill Architecture Workshop), initially hosted in his father's construction business with offices on Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya in the center Barcelona. Building on Catalan traditions of craftsmanship, he enlisted architects and engineers but also writers and artists into a multidisciplinary effort, which later branched into urban design and urban planning. The team experimented on original methodologies based on three-dimensional modular geometries, such as those of the Gaudi District\u00a0[ca] in Reus (1964-1970), El Castillo de Kafka in Sant Pere de Ribes above Sitges (1965-1968), Xanadu (1966-1971) and La Muralla Roja (1968-1973) in Calp.[6] The same thinking was developed on a larger scale with the project La Ciudad en el Espacio (\"The City in Space\"), whose construction started in the Moratalaz area of Madrid in 1970 but was abruptly stopped by Francoist mayor Carlos Arias Navarro.[7] It was instead realized with the construction of Walden 7 in Sant Just Desvern near Barcelona (1970-1975). These projects were recognized as exemplars of critical regionalism and can be viewed as a reaction against both architectural modernism and the Francoist dictatorship in Spain.\n In a context of tense political situation in Spain, Bofill started exploring opportunities abroad in the 1970s. He started a second team in Paris, and gradually introduced symbolic elements into the Taller's designs that echoes French traditions of classical architecture. A seminal concept of the period was the 1971 project of La Petite Cath\u00e9drale (\"the small cathedral\"),[8] actually intended as a large-scale development in Cergy-Pontoise but which remained unbuilt. Another major development was a competition-winning concept for Les Halles in Paris in 1975, whose construction subsequently started but was reversed in 1978 by the newly elected mayor Jacques Chirac.[9] Other projects did come to fruition in the villes nouvelles\u00a0[fr] around Paris which offered a favorable environment for large-scale experimentation, including Les Espaces d'Abraxas in Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e and Les Arcades du Lac in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines. This phase culminated in the expansive Antigone new district of Montpellier in Southern France, for which Bofill presented the initial master plan in 1978.[10] It is associated with both large-scale industrialization in precast concrete and classical forms and geometries in contemporary architecture, which Bofill has called \"modern classicism\". As a consequence, Bofill is often cited as one of the most representative postmodern architects in Europe.[11][12]\n From the mid-1980s, he increasingly shifted to glass and steel for the materials used in his projects, while still using a classical vocabulary of columns and pediments. Representative projects of that period include the 77 West Wacker Drive office tower in Chicago, the extension of Barcelona Airport ahead of the 1992 Summer Olympics, and the National Theater of Catalonia, also in Barcelona. \n In 2000, Bofill re-centralized the activities of the Taller at its head office near Barcelona. His designs in more recent years have gradually shed his classical decorative vocabulary of the 1980s and 1990s, while retaining a highly formal sense of geometry. Representative buildings of this more recent period include the W Barcelona Hotel on the Barcelona seafront and the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University\u00a0[fr] in Ben Guerir, Morocco.\n Bofill has two sons, both of whom as of 2021 work with him at Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura: Ricardo Emilio, born in 1965; and Pablo, born in 1980.
