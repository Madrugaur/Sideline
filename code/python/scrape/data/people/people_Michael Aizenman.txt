{"name": "Michael Aizenman", "content": "Michael Aizenman (born 28 August 1945 in Nizhny Tagil, Russia) is an American-Israeli mathematician and a physicist at Princeton University, working in the fields of mathematical physics, statistical mechanics, functional analysis and probability theory.\n The highlights of his work include: the triviality of a class of scalar quantum field theories in more than four dimensions; a description of the phase transition in the Ising model in three and more dimensions; the sharpness of the phase transition in percolation theory; a method for the study of spectral and dynamical localization for random Schr\u00f6dinger operators; and insights concerning conformal invariance in two-dimensional percolation.[1]\n Aizenman is a Jewish[2] American - Israeli who was born in Russia. He was an undergraduate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was awarded his PhD in 1975 at Yeshiva University (Belfer Graduate School of Science), New York City, with advisor Joel Lebowitz. After postdoctoral appointments at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University (1974\u201375), and Princeton University (1975\u20131977), with Elliott H.
