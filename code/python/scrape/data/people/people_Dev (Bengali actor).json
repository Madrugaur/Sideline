In 2009, he made a cameo appearance in the item song \"Pante tali\" of Chirodini Tumi Je Amar directed by Raj Chakraborty and produced by Shree Venkatesh Films.[46] The song was one of the leading chartbuster songs of the year.\nIn the same year, he appeared in an additional item number \"Jibone ki Pabona\" in the film Jackpot, directed by Kaushik Ganguly. The song was a cover of a track originally performed by Bengali actor Soumitra Chatterjee.[47][48]\nIn 2010, he appeared as himself in Abhik Mukhopadhyay's Ekti Tarar Khonje.[49][50][51]\nIn 2012, Dev made a cameo appearance in Bawali Unlimited, directed by Sujit Mondal.[52]\nIn 2018, Dev made a cameo appearance as himself in Uma, directed by Srijit Mukherji.\n\nIn the media\nDev topped the list Calcutta Times Most Desirable Men in the year 2013.[53] In addition to his films, he also endorses several brands, such as Vivel-ITC Limited,[54] Royal Stag,[55] Shricon TMT Bars,[56][57][58][59] Bakefresh Biscuits,[60] and the television channel Jalsha Movies.[61] He is touted as one of the richest Bengali actors and politicians with assets over \u20b9 15,000,000.[62] Before the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections the Bengali tabloid Ebela asked him if he enjoyed being in the spotlight. He replied: \"...it's just like being raped, either you can enjoy or can shout.\" This comment sparked controversy as being inappropriate and insensitive and led to calls for him to withdraw his candidacy.[63] Thereafter, he apolozised for his comments on his official Twitter account.[64][65]\n\nFilmography\nMain article: Dev filmography\nDiscography\nFilm soundtracks\n\n\nFilm\n\nSong\n\nMusic by\n\nYear\nBanner\n\nRef\n\n\nKhokababu\n\n\"Khoka Chalu Cheez\"\n\nSavvy Gupta\n\n2012\nEskay Movies\n\n[66]\n\n\nChaamp\n\n\"Dekho Dekho Chaamp\"\n\nRaftaar\n\n2017\n\nDev Entertainment Ventures\n\n[67]\n\nAwards and nominations\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Dev (Bengali actor)\nReferences\n\n\n^ a b \"DEV\".
