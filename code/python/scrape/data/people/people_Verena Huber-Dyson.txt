{"name": "Verena Huber-Dyson", "content": "Verena Esther Huber-Dyson (May 6, 1923\u00a0\u2013 March 12, 2016) was a Swiss-American mathematician, known for work in group theory and formal logic.[1][2]  She has been described as a \"brilliant mathematician\",[2] and did research on the interface between algebra and logic, focusing on undecidability in group theory. At the time of her death, she was emeritus faculty in the philosophy department of the University of Calgary, Alberta.\n Huber-Dyson was born Verena Esther Huber in Naples, Italy, on May 6, 1923. Her parents, Karl (Charles) Huber (1893\u20131946) and Berthy Ryffel (1899\u20131945), were Swiss nationals[3] who raised Verena and her sister Adelheid (\"Heidi\", 1925\u20131987) in Athens, Greece, where the girls attended the German-speaking Deutsche Schule, or German School of Athens, until forced to return to Switzerland in 1940 by the war.\n Charles Huber, who had managed the Middle Eastern operations of B\u00fchler AG, a Swiss food-process engineering firm, began working for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), monitoring the treatment of prisoners of war in internment camps. As the ICRC delegate to India and Ceylon, he was responsible for Italian prisoners held in British camps, but also visited German and Allied camps in Europe, and in 1945-46 served as an ICRC delegate to the United States, which he described to Verena as a place she \"definitely ought to experience at length and in depth but just as definitely ought not to settle in.\"[1]\n She studied mathematics, with minors in physics and philosophy, at the University of Zurich, where she obtained her Ph.D. in mathematics in 1947 with a thesis in finite group theory.[4][5][6] under the supervision of Andreas Speiser.\n Verena married Hans-Georg Haefeli, a fellow mathematician, in 1942, and was divorced in 1948. Her first daughter, Katarina Haefeli (now Halm), was born in 1945.[3][8]\n She subsequently married Freeman Dyson in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on August 11, 1950.[5]  They had two children together, Esther Dyson (born July 14, 1951, in Zurich) and George Dyson (born 1953, Ithaca, New York),[2][5] and divorced in 1958.[8]\n Huber-Dyson accepted a postdoctoral fellow appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1948,[9] where she worked on group theory and formal logic.[10][8] She also began teaching at Goucher College near Baltimore during this time.[10]\n She moved to California with her daughter Katarina, began teaching at San Jose State University in 1959, and then joined Alfred Tarski's Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science at the University of California, Berkeley.[8][11]\n Huber-Dyson taught at San Jose State University, the University of Z\u00fcrich, Monash University, as well as at University of California, Berkeley, Adelphi University, University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Illinois at Chicago, in mathematics and in philosophy departments.  She accepted a position in the philosophy department of the University of Calgary in 1973, becoming emerita in 1988.[12]\n After retiring from Calgary, Verena Huber-Dyson moved back to South Pender Island in British Columbia, where she lived for 14 years.[15][16] She died on March 12, 2016 in Bellingham, Washington, at the age of 92.[1][7]\n \"There is more to truth than can be caught by proof\".  \n ", "tags": ["1923 births", "2016 deaths", "Expatriates in Canada", "Expatriates in Switzerland", "Goucher College faculty and staff", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Mathematical logicians", "University of Calgary faculty", "University of California, Berkeley faculty", "University of Zurich alumni", "Women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "CS1 maint: date and year", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Swiss-American mathematician (1923-2016)\nVerena Huber-DysonBornVerena Esther Huber(1923-05-06)May 6, 1923Naples, ItalyDiedMarch 12, 2016(2016-03-12) (aged\u00a092)[1]Bellingham, WashingtonOther\u00a0namesVerena Huber, Verena HaefeliCitizenshipSwitzerlandUnited StatesEducationUniversity of Z\u00fcrichSpouse(s)Hans-Georg Haefeli (1942-1948)Freeman Dyson (1950\u20131958)ChildrenKatarina HalmEsther DysonGeorge DysonScientific careerFieldsLogic, algebraInstitutionsUniversity of California, BerkeleyAdelphi UniversityUniversity of California, Los AngelesUniversity of Illinois at Urbana\u2013ChampaignUniversity of CalgaryThesisEin Dualismus als Klassifikationsprinzip in der abstrakten Gruppentheorie\u00a0(1947)Doctoral advisorAndreas Speiser\n\nVerena Esther Huber-Dyson (May 6, 1923\u00a0\u2013 March 12, 2016) was a Swiss-American mathematician, known for work in group theory and formal logic.[1][2]  She has been described as a \"brilliant mathematician\",[2] and did research on the interface between algebra and logic, focusing on undecidability in group theory.
