She was the first Bulgarian woman to graduate in mathematics. \n Danova's father had been a Russian feldsher in the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878) who settled in Bulgaria when he met his future wife. Sofia had a sister Olya.[1] She graduated from the Metropolitan Clement Girls' High School in Veliko Tarnovo. She then went to Russia to attend the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology from where she obtained a degree in mathematics. Between 1904 and 1907, she taught mathematics at the Plovdiv Girls' Gymnasium. She married Gruyo Danov, a son of Hristo G. Danov, a publisher, in 1907.[1] She also was active in the family publishing house after her father-in-law's death in 1911, along with her husband and brother-in-law.
