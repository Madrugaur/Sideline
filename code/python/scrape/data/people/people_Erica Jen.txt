{"name": "Erica Jen", "content": "Erica Jen (Chinese: \u4efb\u5cfb\u745e; R\u00e9n J\u00f9nr\u00f9i, born circa 1952) is an American applied mathematician.[1][2][3] She was a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, a faculty member at the University of Southern California, and a scientific director and faculty member at the Santa Fe Institute.[4][5]\n Jen's research is based on the mathematical analysis of chaotic and complex behavior.[6] Research areas have included the singular integral equations for crack propagation, the mathematics of cellular automata - a class of dynamical systems that evolve according to simple local interaction rules - and mechanisms of robustness in natural and social systems.[7]\n Jen was born in 1952 to Chih-Kung Jen, a Chinese-born physicist who played a leading role in the 1970s in reestablishing scientific exchanges between the U.S. and China. After her junior year at Yale University, Jen went to Beijing University for further education. She became the first American national to be allowed to study in China since 1949 and the first foreigner since the Cultural Revolution\n After returning to the U.S., Jen obtained a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from SUNY at Stony Brook and was the first postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory.[8]\n Jen served for the period 1983-86 as a University Scholar and assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Southern California. In 1986, Jen became a staff member in the Theoretical Division and Acting Deputy Director of the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n In 1995, Jen joined the Santa Fe Institute, a leading interdisciplinary research center for the study of complex adaptive systems.[9] She first served as Vice President for Academic Affairs and then as a Research Professor. Jen was the Principal Investigator for innovative programs in evolutionary dynamics, social networks, and distributed learning.[10] During her tenure at the Santa Fe Institute, Jen developed the groundbreaking SFI program on the robustness of physical, biological, ecological, and social systems. After 2003, Jen served as External Faculty, Science Board member, and now Science Board Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute. Jen was an editor of Physica D: Nonlinearity, and is also the developer of the Nonlinear Sciences nlin arXive.\n ", "tags": ["20th-century American mathematicians", "Peking University alumni", "University of Southern California faculty", "Los Alamos National Laboratory", "Santa Fe Institute people", "Yale University alumni", "Complex systems scientists", "State University of New York", "Women mathematicians", "1950s births", "Living people", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "American applied mathematician\nErica JenBorn1952CitizenshipUnited StatesAlma\u00a0materYale UniversityBeijing UniversityOccupationApplied MathematicianYears\u00a0active1983 - present\nErica Jen (Chinese: \u4efb\u5cfb\u745e; R\u00e9n J\u00f9nr\u00f9i, born circa 1952) is an American applied mathematician.[1][2][3] She was a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, a faculty member at the University of Southern California, and a scientific director and faculty member at the Santa Fe Institute.[4][5]\nJen's research is based on the mathematical analysis of chaotic and complex behavior.[6] Research areas have included the singular integral equations for crack propagation, the mathematics of cellular automata - a class of dynamical systems that evolve according to simple local interaction rules - and mechanisms of robustness in natural and social systems.[7]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Selected bibliography\n4 References\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nJen was born in 1952 to Chih-Kung Jen, a Chinese-born physicist who played a leading role in the 1970s in reestablishing scientific exchanges between the U.S. and China.
