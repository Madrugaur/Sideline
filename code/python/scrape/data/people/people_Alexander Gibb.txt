He was the great-grandson of John Gibb, an early member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and a colleague of its first President, Thomas Telford.[1] He was educated at the High School of Dundee, the Abbey School in Beckenham, Rugby School and University College London, although he left the latter after a year to become articled to the prominent civil engineers John Wolfe Barry and Henry Marc Brunel.[2][3] Having completed his training, he became resident engineer on the Metropolitan District Railway's Whitechapel and Bow Railway extension. He joined his father's company, Easton, Gibb & Son, in 1900 when they were building the King Edward VII Bridge at Kew.[1][3] In the same year Gibb married Norah Isobel Monteith (1879-1940),[4] daughter of Fleet Surgeon John Lowry Monteith RN, and they had three sons,[5] including Lieutenant Colonel Alistair Monteith Gibb.[6]\n Gibb later worked on the construction of the Rosyth naval dockyard where he is credited with accelerating the programme so that it was brought into use during the First World War.[1][3] In 1916, Gibb was appointed Chief Engineer of Ports Construction to the British Armies in France and Belgium, becoming Deputy-Director of Docks, British Expeditionary Force in France in 1917.[3] During this time he prepared plans for the repairs of Belgian harbours, was responsible for the water supply for Belgium, and prepared special landing facilities for cross-channel ferries at Dieppe, Calais and Dunkirk.[3] Gibb was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 New Year Honours in recognition of his military service.[7][8] Later that year he was appointed Civil Engineer-in-Chief to the Admiralty with responsibility for all naval civil engineering works, with projects including the Admiralty M-N Scheme - an anti-submarine boom across the English Channel.[1]\n He joined the Ministry of Transport in 1919 as Director-General of Civil Engineering, and in the following years served on a number of committees including the Technical Committee on London Traffic (as chair), the Electrification of Railways Advisory Committee and the Light Railways Investigation Committee (as chair).
