He spent his fourth year at Harvard,[1] training in Boston, USA,[2] before returning to the UK to qualify in 1932.[1]\n At the age of 29,[3] Gibson was appointed as Coventry\u2019s first City Architect and Planning Officer.\n The re-planning of Coventry City Centre began before the Blitz in 1940-1941; indeed, Gibson produced the initial plan to rebuild part of the city in early 1940, in order to resolve the problems of overcrowding and congestion of the medieval town centre.[4]  It was, however, the extensive wartime damage that enabled the Gibson plan to be turned into reality.[5]\n The Gibson plan involved a re-thinking of the city centre, introducing what was then a brand new town planning concept, with the main premise being a separation of motor traffic and pedestrians.  Such traffic-free shopping precinct was the first in Europe, and was seen as a \"truly pioneering design\" in its day.[6] In addition, Gibson was responsible for the first rooftop parking plus the development of a civic theatre (the Belgrade Theatre) and the circular market.\n The Gibson plan saw extensive consultation with local people, with the \"proposals and suggestions for the physical reconstruction and planning of the City of Coventry\" set out in a book entitled The Future Coventry, published by the Corporation of Coventry.[7]  It was also supported by the Government, where the then Minister of Works, Lord Reith commented, \"Coventry would be a test case, not for me and my authority, but for the Government and for England\".[8]\n Gibson was succeeded by Arthur Ling who was City Architect from 1955 until 1964.\n The redevelopment of the city was featured in a special edition of Architectural Design published in December 1958.[4]\n Gibson left Coventry in 1955, and became County Architect in Nottinghamshire.
