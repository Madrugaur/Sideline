It\u00f4 calculus is a method used in the mathematical study of random events and is applied in various fields, and is perhaps best known for its use in mathematical finance. It\u00f4 also made contributions to the study of diffusion processes on manifolds, known as stochastic differential geometry.[3]\n Although the standard Hepburn romanization of his name is Kiyoshi It\u014d, he used the spelling Kiyosi It\u00f4 (Kunrei-shiki romanization).

Between 1938 and 1945, It\u00f4 worked for the Japanese National Statistical Bureau, where he published two of his seminal works on probability and stochastic processes, including a series of articles in which he defined the stochastic integral and laid he foundations of the It\u014d calculus.
