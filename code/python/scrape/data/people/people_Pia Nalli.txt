{"name": "Pia Nalli", "content": "Pia Maria Nalli (February 10, 1886 \u2013 September 27, 1964) was an Italian mathematician known for her work on the summability of Fourier series, on Morera's theorem for analytic functions of several variables and for finding the solution to the Fredholm integral equation of the third kind for the first time.[3] Her research interests ranged from algebraic geometry to functional analysis and tensor analysis; she was a speaker at the 1928 International Congress of Mathematicians.\n She is also remembered for her struggles against discrimination against women in the Italian university hiring system.[4] A street in Rome is named after her.\n Nalli was born on February 10, 1886, in Palermo, to a middle-class family with seven children.[5] She studied at the University of Palermo, where she obtained a laurea in 1910 under the supervision of Giuseppe Bagnera,[6] with a thesis concerning algebraic geometry, and in the same year joined the Circolo Matematico di Palermo.[5]\n After finishing her studies, Nalli assisted Bagnera in Palermo in 1911, and then began working as a school teacher. She completed a habilitation thesis in 1914 on the theory of integrals, and continued to work on Fourier analysis and Dirichlet series for the next several years.[5]\n Nalli served as assistant to Giuseppe Bagnera at the University of Palermo from 1 April 1911 to 16 November 1911. She then taught at a number of secondary schools, first in the girls' school at Avellino, then in Trapani, and from 16 November 1912 in the girls' technical school in Palermo. During this time Nalli continued her research, completing her thesis \"Esposizione e confronto critico delle diverse definizioni proposte per l'integrale definito di una funzione limitata o no\",[2] a study of the theory of the integral based on recent work on the subject by \u00c9mile Borel, Henri Lebesgue Charles de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin, Giuseppe Vitali and Arnaud Denjoy.[5]\n In 1921, Nalli became extraordinary professor at the University of Cagliari. She had been ranked second to Mauro Picone in the competition for the position, possibly in part because she was female, but Picone chose to stay at the University of Catania and become head of mathematics there, so the Cagliari position fell to Nalli. In 1923, she was listed first in a search for a position at the University of Pavia, but not offered the position. Finally, after similar mistreatment from several other universities, she moved to the University of Catania as a full professor in 1927. At around this time, perhaps encouraged by Tullio Levi-Civita, she switched her research focus from functional analysis to tensor calculus.[5]\n She was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1928.[7]\n Nalli died on September 27, 1964, in Catania. A street in Rome, the Via Pia Nalli,[8] is named after her.[5]\n Pia Nalli published 61 mathematical works, including the monograph (Nalli 1914) and a textbook.[9] Her \"Selected works\" (Nalli 1976) include this monograph plus eleven articles on topics mainly belonging to functional and mathematical analysis: the following list includes also her doctoral thesis (Nalli 1911) and other works on tensor calculus\n ", "tags": ["1886 births", "1964 deaths", "20th-century mathematicians", "Italian mathematicians", "Mathematical analysts", "Functional analysts", "University of Palermo alumni", "University of Cagliari faculty", "University of Catania faculty", "20th-century women scientists", "Scientists from Palermo", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 Italian-language sources (it)", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Italian mathematician\nPia NalliPia NalliBorn(1886-02-10)10 February 1886PalermoDiedSeptember 27, 1964(1964-09-27) (aged\u00a078)CataniaAlma\u00a0materUniversity of PalermoScientific careerFields\nFunctional analysis\nTheory of the integral\nTensor calculus\nInstitutions\nUniversity of Cagliari\nUniversity of Catania\nTheses\nRiduzione di un fascio di curve piane di genere uno, corrispondente a s\u00e9 stesso in una trasformazione birazionale involutoria del piano[1]\u00a0(1911)\nEsposizione e confronto critico delle diverse definizioni proposte per l'integrale definito[2]\u00a0(1914)\nDoctoral advisorGiuseppe BagneraNotable studentsGaetano Fichera\n\nPia Maria Nalli (February 10, 1886 \u2013 September 27, 1964) was an Italian mathematician known for her work on the summability of Fourier series, on Morera's theorem for analytic functions of several variables and for finding the solution to the Fredholm integral equation of the third kind for the first time.[3] Her research interests ranged from algebraic geometry to functional analysis and tensor analysis; she was a speaker at the 1928 International Congress of Mathematicians.\nShe is also remembered for her struggles against discrimination against women in the Italian university hiring system.[4] A street in Rome is named after her.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and academic career\n\n1.1 Early life and education\n1.2 Academic career\n1.3 Death and legacy\n\n\n2 Selected works\n3 Notes\n4 References\n\n4.1 Biographical and general references\n4.2 Scientific references\n\n\n5 External links\n\n\nLife and academic career[edit]\nEarly life and education[edit]\nNalli was born on February 10, 1886, in Palermo, to a middle-class family with seven children.[5] She studied at the University of Palermo, where she obtained a laurea in 1910 under the supervision of Giuseppe Bagnera,[6] with a thesis concerning algebraic geometry, and in the same year joined the Circolo Matematico di Palermo.[5]\nAfter finishing her studies, Nalli assisted Bagnera in Palermo in 1911, and then began working as a school teacher.
