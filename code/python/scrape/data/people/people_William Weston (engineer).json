Possible connections of William Weston to William Weston Young and Lewis Weston Dillwyn - financial backers of the potter and ceramic artist William Billingsley - were then investigated.\nThe bulleted  information is sourced from the book Billingsley, Brampton and Beyond ... in search of The Weston Connection by Pamela (Theophilus) Gardner, pub Matador/Troubador Publishing Ltd., 2010\n\nContents\n\n1 Career\n2 Summary of works\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nCareer[edit]\nWilliam Weston is first noticed with his work on Trent Bridge, Gainsborough between 1787 and 1791.\nIn 1792 he sailed from Falmouth to the United States of America to start a five-year engagement as Engineer to the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company in Pennsylvania.\nAmong others, Weston trained (in 1794) Benjamin Wright later chief engineer of the Erie Canal and Loammi Baldwin chief engineer of the Middlesex Canal.\nHe returned to England in 1801, but retained his connection with the United States and was a consultant to the Erie Canal Commissioners.\n\nSummary of works[edit]\n The bridge at Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, Weston's only known work in England\n1791 Trent Bridge, Gainsborough\n1795 Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company\n1798 Delaware and Schuylkill Canal\n1793 Conewago Canal, Pennsylvania\n1796 Middlesex Canal, Massachusetts\n1796 Potomac River Locks\n1798 Western Inland Lock Navigation, New York\n1796 James River Canal\n1801 Schuylkill River Bridge\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ A biographical dictionary of civil engineers in Great Britain and Ireland.
