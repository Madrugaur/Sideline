{"name": "Achyutha Pisharadi", "content": "\nAchyutha Pisharodi  (c. 1550 at thrikkandiyur (aka Kundapura), Tirur, Kerala, India \u2013 7 July 1621 in Kerala) was a Sanskrit grammarian, astrologer, astronomer and mathematician who studied under Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva and was a member of Madhava of Sangamagrama's Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. He is remembered mainly for his part in the composition of his student Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri's devotional poem, Narayaneeyam.\n He discovered the techniques of 'the reduction of the ecliptic'. He authored Sphuta-nirnaya, Raasi-gola-sphuta-neeti (raasi meaning zodiac, gola meaning sphere and neeti roughly meaning rule), Karanottama (1593) and a four- chapter treatise Uparagakriyakrama on lunar and solar eclipses.\n Pisharati is known to have scolded and provoked an errant Narayana to take up the Brahmin's duties of prayer and religious practices. He accepted Narayana as his student. Later when Pisharati was struck with paralysis (or rheumatism by another account), Narayana, unable to bear the pain of his dear guru, by way of Gurudakshina took the disease upon himself. As a result, Pisharati is said to have been cured, but no medicine could cure Narayana. As a last resort, Narayana went to Guruvayur and requested Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan, a great devotee of Guruvayoorappan, to suggest a remedy for his disease. Ramajunan Ezhuthachan advised him to compose a poetical work on the Avatars (incarnations) of Lord Vishnu beginning with that of Matsya (Fish). Narayana composed beautiful slokas in praise of Lord Guruvayurappan and recited them before the deity. He was soon cured of his disease.\n The book of slokas written by Narayana were named Narayaneeyam. The day on which Narayana dedicated his Narayaneeyam to Sri Guruvayurappan is celebrated as \"Narayaneeyam Dinam\" every year at Guruvayur.\n ", "tags": ["1550 births", "1621 deaths", "Scholars from Kerala", "Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics", "16th-century Indian astronomers", "17th-century Indian astronomers", "16th-century Indian mathematicians", "17th-century Indian mathematicians", "Scientists from Kerala", "People from Malappuram district", "16th-century Indian linguists", "Writers from Kerala", "Sanskrit writers", "17th-century Indian linguists", "People from Guruvayur", "Articles lacking in-text citations from January 2019", "All articles lacking in-text citations", "Use dmy dates from January 2019", "Use Indian English from January 2019", "All Wikipedia articles written in Indian English", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article includes a list of references, related reading or external links, but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations.
