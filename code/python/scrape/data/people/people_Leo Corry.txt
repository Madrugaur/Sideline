{"name": "Leo Corry", "content": "Leo Corry (\u05dc\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9, born 1956 in Santiago de Chile[1]) is an Israeli historian of mathematics.\n Corry migrated with his Jewish family to Venezuela when he was two years old. He attended primary and secondary school at Colegio Moral y Luces of Caracas and then at the Universidad Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar studied mathematics with licentiate's degree in 1977. He attended graduate school at the University of Tel Aviv. There he received in 1983 his master's degree in mathematics with master's thesis Splitting data in cohomology classes, supervised by Shmuel Rosset, and in 1990 his Ph.D. in the history of science with Ph.D. thesis The origins of category theory as a mathematical discipline, supervised by Sabetai Unguru and Shmuel Rosset.[2] At the University of Tel Aviv, Corry became in 1985 an instructor, in 1996 a lecturer, in 2004 an associate professor and from 2007 a full professor in the Cohn Institute for the History of Science. He was the Director of the Cohn Institute from 2003 to 2009, Director of the Yavetz School of HIsotircal Studies from 2013 to 2015, and Dean of HUmanities at TAU between 2015 and 2020. In the academic year 1994\u20131995, he was fellow at the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology at MIT, for the academic year 1995\u20131996 at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin and in 2006 at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin.\n Corry has done research on the development of modern algebra and number theory (including computational number theory done by Harry Vandiver, D. H. Lehmer, and Emma Lehmer) and the philosophy of mathematics (including the Bourbaki School). His research has also dealt with Albert Einstein, Hermann Minkowski, David Hilbert and his school, the history of Latin American science, and Jorge Luis Borges.[3] With John Stachel and J\u00fcrgen Renn, Corry discovered new documents concerning the priority dispute between Hilbert and Einstein, and these new documents support Einstein against Hilbert.[4][5]\n In 2006, Corry was an invited speaker at the ICM in Madrid with a talk On the origin of Hilbert's sixth problem: physics and the empiricist approach to axiomatization.[6]\n From 1999 to 2009 and from 2011 to 2013, he was editor of Science in Context.[citation needed]\n ", "tags": ["1956 births", "Living people", "People from Santiago", "Tel Aviv University alumni", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty", "Tel Aviv University faculty", "Israeli mathematicians", "Historians of science", "Historians of mathematics", "Venezuelan Jews", "Israeli historians", "Articles with short description", "Articles with short description added by PearBOT 5", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from September 2017", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Israeli historian of mathematics\n Leo Corry\nLeo Corry (\u05dc\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9, born 1956 in Santiago de Chile[1]) is an Israeli historian of mathematics.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Selected publications\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nCorry migrated with his Jewish family to Venezuela when he was two years old.
