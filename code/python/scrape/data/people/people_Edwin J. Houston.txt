{"name": "Edwin J. Houston", "content": "Edwin James Houston (July 9, 1847 \u2013 March 1, 1914) was an American electrical engineer, academic, businessman, inventor and writer.\n Houston was born July 9, 1847, to John Mason and Mary (Lamour) Houston in Alexandria, Virginia. He graduated from Central High School of Philadelphia  (a degree-granting institution rather than an ordinary high school) in 1864.[1]  He received both his Bachelor of Arts and master's degree from the same Central High School, where he then became professor of civil engineering for a short period before holding its chair of Natural Philosophy and Physical Geography. Princeton University awarded him an honorary doctoral degree. He also served as emeritus professor of physics at the Franklin Institute and professor of physics at the Medico-Chirurgical College.[2]\n While teaching physics at Central High School in Philadelphia, he helped design an arc light generator with his former student colleague Elihu Thomson. Together, they created the Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1882 which soon after moved to Lynn, Massachusetts.[3] He served as chief electrician of Philadelphia's International Electrical Exhibition in 1884.\n In 1892, Thomson-Houston merged with the Edison General Electric Company to form General Electric, with management from Thomson-Houston largely running the new company. In 1894, Houston formed a consulting firm in electrical engineering with Arthur Kennelly. He and Kennelly had also jointly published a series called \"Primers of Electricity\" in 1884.\n Houston was twice president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (1893\u20131895).[4] He was a member of the United States Electrical Commission, the American Institute of Mining Engineers, the American Philosophical Society and many others.[5] He also authored books for a series called \"The Wonder Books of Science\" to include The Wonder Book of Volcanoes and Earthquakes, The Wonder Book of the Atmosphere,  The Wonder Book of Light, and the Wonder Book of Magnetism.[6]  He died from heart failure in 1914.[7]\n (Edited list, drawn from Jan 21, 1911 Electrical Review and Western Electrician p.125)\n ", "tags": ["1847 births", "1914 deaths", "American academics", "American business writers", "American chief executives", "American civil engineers", "American electrical engineers", "American engineering writers", "American inventors", "Businesspeople from Alexandria, Virginia", "Businesspeople from Pennsylvania", "Engineers from Virginia", "General Electric people", "19th-century American businesspeople", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Edwin J.
