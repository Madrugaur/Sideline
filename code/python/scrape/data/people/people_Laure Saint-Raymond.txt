{"name": "Laure Saint-Raymond", "content": "Laure Saint-Raymond (born 1975) is a French mathematician, and a professor of mathematics at \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon. She is known for her work in partial differential equations, and in particular for her contributions to the mathematically rigorous study of the connections between interacting particle systems, the Boltzmann equation, and fluid mechanics. In 2008 she was awarded the European Mathematical Society Prize, with her citation reading:\n Saint-Raymond is well known for her outstanding results on nonlinear partial differential equations in the dynamics of gases and plasmas and also in fluid dynamics.
