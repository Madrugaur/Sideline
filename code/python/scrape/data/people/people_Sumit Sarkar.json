He was Professor of History at the University of Delhi.[1]\n He was one of the founding members of the Subaltern Studies Collective, but later distanced himself from the project. He noted that arguments made by the later issues of the journal as well as books by Partha Chatterjee in that they blanketly criticized the Enlightenment, the nation-state and secularism lined up with indigenist critiques that were at home with the Hindu right. In his view this error was traceable to a basic confusion in the early project that posed an absolute separation between the elite and subaltern domains.[2]\n He was awarded the Rabindra Puraskar literary award for his book Writing Social History by the West Bengal government in 2004. He returned the award in 2007 in protest against the expulsion of farmers from their land.[3]\n He contributed a volume to the Towards Freedom project of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), publication of which was blocked in 2000 by the ICHR under the influence of then Indian government administered by the Bharatiya Janata Party as alleged by Sarkar.[4] The publication of the volume was eventually allowed by the Government of India once the Congress party came to power after the general election of 2004.[5]\n ", "tags": ["1939 births", "Presidency University, Kolkata alumni", "University of Calcutta alumni", "University of Calcutta faculty", "University of Burdwan faculty", "University of Delhi faculty", "Jawaharlal Nehru University faculty", "Bengali historians", "Brahmos", "Fellows of Wolfson College, Oxford", "Historians of South Asia", "Historians of colonialism", "20th-century Indian historians", "Living people", "Indian Marxist historians", "Indian political writers", "Writers about Hindu nationalism", "CS1 maint: unfit URL", "Articles lacking in-text citations from February 2019", "All articles lacking in-text citations", "BLP articles lacking sources from February 2019", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with multiple maintenance issues", "Use dmy dates from May 2020", "Use Indian English from May 2018", "All Wikipedia articles written in Indian English", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article has multiple issues.
