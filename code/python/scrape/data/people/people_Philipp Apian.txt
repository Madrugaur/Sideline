{"name": "Philipp Apian", "content": "Philipp Apian (14 September 1531 \u2013 14 November 1589) was a German mathematician and medic. The son of Petrus Apianus (1495\u20131552), he is also known as the cartographer of Bavaria.\n He was born in Ingolstadt as Philipp Bienewitz (or Bennewitz). At age eleven, the son of mathematician, astronomer and cartographer Peter Apian started to study mathematics at the University of Ingolstadt. Later, aged 18, he studied in Burgundy, Paris and Bourges.\n Returning in 1552 he became a professor. As a Protestant he had to leave in 1569 due to Jesuits and the counter reformation.
