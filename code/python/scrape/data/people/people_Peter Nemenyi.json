{"name": "Peter Nemenyi", "content": "Peter Bj\u00f6rn Nemenyi (April 14, 1927\u00a0\u2013 May 20, 2002) was an American mathematician, who worked in statistics and probability theory. He taught mathematics at a number of American colleges and universities, including Hunter College, Tougaloo College, Oberlin College, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Virginia State College and the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.[1]  Several statistical tests, for example the Nemenyi test, bear his name. He was also a prominent civil-rights activist. He was the son of Paul Nemenyi an eminent fluid and engineering mechanics expert of the twentieth century. His mother was Aranka Heller, poet and scholar, daughter of Bernat Heller, a renowned 'Aggadist, Islamic scholar and folklorist.[2]\n Peter Nemenyi was born in Berlin, to which his parents had fled after anti-Jewish laws had been enacted in Hungary. His parents separated, and he was brought up in a socialist boarding school operated by the ISK, a German socialist party founded by Leonard Nelson.\nAfter the rise of Nazism, the party was banned in Germany and its property was seized. The school frequently relocated to different European countries, as Nazi strength grew.  During the Second World War the adults in the party were interned on the Isle of Man and Nemenyi lived in a number of foster homes and youth homes.\n After the war, Peter moved to the United States to live with his father in Hanford, Washington.[3][4]\n He was drafted almost immediately and served near Trieste.\nAfter military service, he attended Black Mountain College under the G.I. Bill.\nHe received his Ph.D. from Princeton University with a thesis on Distribution-Free Multiple Comparisons advised by John Wilder Tukey. Several statistical tests, most notably the Nemenyi test bear his name.\n Peter Nemenyi is also known as a civil-rights activist in the Deep South.  He also worked for the revolutionary government in Nicaragua, which affected his health.[5]\nHe was an active member of the Congress of Racial Equality in New York, working in Mississippi in 1962, in Jackson, and 1964-5 in Laurel.\n Nemenyi's father, Paul Nemenyi, was probably the father of 1972 World Chess Champion Bobby Fischer. Peter Nemenyi was aware of this, and made efforts to care for the young Fischer after Paul Nemenyi died in 1952.[6]\n ", "tags": ["1927 births", "2002 deaths", "People from Berlin", "Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United States", "American statisticians", "American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent", "Black Mountain College alumni", "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison faculty", "20th-century chess players", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Peter Bj\u00f6rn Nemenyi (April 14, 1927\u00a0\u2013 May 20, 2002) was an American mathematician, who worked in statistics and probability theory.
