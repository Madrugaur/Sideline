{"name": "Walter Feit", "content": "Walter Feit (October 26, 1930 \u2013 July 29, 2004) was an Austrian-born American mathematician who worked in finite group theory and representation theory. His contributions provided elementary infrastructure used in algebra, geometry, topology, number theory, and logic. His work helped the development and utilization of sectors like cryptography, chemistry, and physics.\n He was born to a Jewish family in Vienna and escaped for England in 1939 via the Kindertransport.[1] He moved to the United States in 1946 where he became an undergraduate at the University of Chicago. He did his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, and became a professor at Cornell University in 1952, and at Yale University in 1964.\n His most famous result is his joint, with John G. Thompson, proof of the Feit\u2013Thompson theorem that all finite groups of odd order are solvable. At the time it was written, it was probably the most complicated and difficult mathematical proof ever completed.[according to whom?] He wrote almost a hundred other papers, mostly on finite group theory, character theory (in particular introducing the concept of a coherent set of characters), and modular representation theory. Another regular theme in his research was the study of linear groups of small degree, that is, finite groups of matrices in low dimensions. It was often the case that, while the conclusions concerned groups of complex matrices, the techniques employed were from modular representation theory.\n He also wrote the books:\nThe representation theory of finite groups[2] and \nCharacters of finite groups,[3] which are now standard references on character theory, including treatments of modular representations\nand modular characters.\n Feit was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Nice in 1970. \nHe was awarded the Cole Prize by the American Mathematical Society in 1965, and was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
