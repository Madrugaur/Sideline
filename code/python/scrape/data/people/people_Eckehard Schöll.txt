He is an expert in the field of nonlinear dynamics and head of the group Nonlinear dynamics and control.[1] His work pertains to research in the fields of mathematics and physics, particularly semiconductor physics, neurodynamics and bifurcation theory. His latest research is also related to topics in biology and the social sciences, e.g.  simulation of the dynamics in  socioeconomic or neuronal networks.[2] \nHe is one of the forerunners into the research of chimera states.\n Eckehard Sch\u00f6ll is the author of over 500 publications in scientific journals,[3] \nthree books (Nonequilibrium Phase Transitions in Semiconductors (Springer 1987), The Physics of Instabilities in Solid State Electron \nDevices (Plenum Press, New York, 1992), and Nonlinear Spatio-Temporal Dynamics and Chaos in Semiconductors (Cambridge University Press 2001)) as well as editor of several books.[4] His Hirsch index is 59 (as of May 2017) and his Einstein number is 5.[5]\n Since 1989  Eckehard Sch\u00f6ll is Hochschulprofessor at the Technical University of Berlin where to date he has supervised 100 Diplom-, Master- und Bachelor thesis, 30 PhD thesis und 2 habilitations.
