{"name": "Willard Boyle", "content": "Willard Sterling Boyle, CC (August 19, 1924\u00a0\u2013 May 7, 2011) was a Canadian physicist.[4] He was a pioneer in the field of laser technology and co-inventor of the charge-coupled device.[5] As director of Space Science and Exploratory Studies at Bellcomm he helped select lunar landing sites and provided support for the Apollo space program.[6]\n On October 6, 2009, it was announced that he would share the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics for \"the invention of an imaging semiconductor circuit\u2014the CCD sensor, which has become an electronic eye in almost all areas of photography\".[2]\n He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada \u2014 the award's highest level \u2014 on June 30, 2010.[7]\n Born in Amherst, Nova Scotia, on August 19, 1924, Boyle was the son of a medical doctor and moved to Quebec with his father and mother Bernice when he was less than two.[8] He was home schooled by his mother until age fourteen, when he attended Montreal's Lower Canada College to complete his secondary education.[8]\n Boyle attended McGill University, but his education was interrupted in 1943, when he joined the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II.[8] He was loaned to the Royal Navy, where he was learning how to land Spitfires on aircraft carriers as the war ended.[8] He gained a BSc in 1947, an MSc in 1948, and a PhD degree in 1950, all from McGill University.[9]\n After receiving his doctorate, Boyle spent one year at Canada's Radiation Lab and two years teaching physics at the Royal Military College of Canada.[8]\n In 1953 Boyle joined Bell Labs where he invented the first continuously operating ruby laser with Don Nelson in 1962,[6] \nand was named on the first patent for a semiconductor injection laser.[6] He was made director of Space Science and Exploratory Studies at the Bell Labs subsidiary Bellcomm in 1962, providing support for the Apollo space program and helping to select lunar landing sites.[6] He returned to Bell Labs in 1964, working on the development of integrated circuits.[6]\n In 1969, Boyle and George E. Smith invented the charge-coupled device (CCD), for which they have jointly received the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1973, the 1974 IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award, the 2006 Charles Stark Draper Prize, and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.[9][6] The CCD allowed NASA to send clear pictures to Earth back from space.[10] It is also the technology that powers many digital cameras today. Smith said of their invention: \"After making the first couple of imaging devices, we knew for certain that chemistry photography was dead.\" [11] Eugene Gordon and Mike Tompsett, two now-retired colleagues from Bell labs, claim that its application to photography was not invented by Boyle.[12] Boyle was Executive Director of Research for Bell Labs from 1975 until his retirement in 1979.[10]\n In retirement he split his time between Halifax and Wallace, Nova Scotia.[13] In Wallace, he helped launch an art gallery with his wife, Betty, a landscape artist.[8] He was married to Betty since 1946 and had four children, 10 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.[5]\n In his later years, Boyle suffered from kidney disease, and due to complications from this disease, died in a hospital in  Nova Scotia on May 7, 2011.[10]\n ", "tags": ["1924 births", "2011 deaths", "Canadian expatriates in the United States", "Canadian inventors", "Canadian Nobel laureates", "Canadian physicists", "Companions of the Order of Canada", "Deaths from kidney disease", "Disease-related deaths in Nova Scotia", "McGill University alumni", "Nobel laureates in Physics", "Draper Prize winners", "People from Amherst, Nova Scotia", "People from Cumberland County, Nova Scotia", "Royal Military College of Canada faculty", "Scientists at Bell Labs", "Nobelprize template using Wikidata property P8024", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Willard S.
