{"name": "Charles Algernon Parsons", "content": "\n The Honourable Sir Charles Algernon Parsons, OM, KCB, FRS (13 June 1854 \u2013 11 February 1931) was an Anglo-Irish engineer, best known for his invention of the compound steam turbine,[1] and as the namesake of C.\u00a0A.\u00a0Parsons and Company.  He worked as an engineer on dynamo and turbine design, and power generation, with great influence on the naval and electrical engineering fields. He also developed optical equipment for searchlights and telescopes.\n Parsons was born into an Anglo-Irish family[2][3][4] in London as the youngest son of the famous astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse. (The family seat is Birr Castle, County Offaly, Ireland, and the town of Birr was called Parsonstown, after the family, from 1620 to 1901.)[5]\n With his three brothers, Parsons was educated at home in Ireland by private tutors[6] (including John Purser), all of whom were well versed in the sciences and also acted as practical assistants to the Earl in his astronomical work. (One of them later became, as Sir Robert Ball, Astronomer Royal for Ireland.) Parsons then read mathematics at Trinity College, Dublin and at St. John's College, Cambridge, graduating from the latter in 1877 with a first-class honours degree.[7] He joined the  Newcastle-based engineering firm of W.G. Armstrong as an apprentice, an unusual step for the son of an earl. Later he moved to  Kitsons in Leeds, where he worked on rocket-powered torpedoes.[citation needed]\n In 1884 Parsons moved to Clarke, Chapman and Co., ship-engine manufacturers operating near Newcastle, where he became head of their electrical-equipment development. He developed a turbine engine there in 1884 and immediately utilized the new engine to drive an electrical generator, which he also designed. Parsons' steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionised marine transport and naval warfare.[8]\n Another type of steam turbine at the time, invented by Gustaf de Laval (1845-1913) in the 1880s, was an  impulse design that subjected the mechanism to huge centrifugal forces and so had limited output due to the weakness of the materials available. Parsons explained in his 1911 Rede Lecture that his appreciation of the scaling issue led to his 1884 breakthrough on the compound steam-turbine:\n It seemed to me that moderate surface velocities and speeds of rotation were essential if the turbine motor was to receive general acceptance as a prime mover. I therefore decided to split up the fall in pressure of the steam into small fractional expansions over a large number of turbines in series, so that the velocity of the steam nowhere should be great...I was also anxious to avoid the well-known cutting action on metal of steam at high velocity.\"[9] In 1889 he founded  C.\u00a0A.\u00a0Parsons and Company in Newcastle to produce turbo generators to his design.[10] In the same year he set up the Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company (DisCO). In 1890, DisCo opened Forth Banks Power Station, the first power-station in the world to generate electricity using turbo generators.[11]\nIn 1894 he regained certain patent rights from Clarke Chapman. Although his first turbine was only 1.6% efficient and generated a mere 7.5 kilowatts, rapid incremental improvements in a few years led to his first megawatt turbine, built in 1899 for a generating plant at  Elberfeld in the German Empire.[9]\n Also interested in marine applications, Parsons founded the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company in Newcastle.  Famously, in June 1897, his turbine-powered yacht, Turbinia, was exhibited[by whom?] moving at speed at Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Fleet Review off Portsmouth, to demonstrate the great potential of the new technology. The Turbinia moved at 34\u00a0kn (63\u00a0km/h; 39\u00a0mph); the fastest Royal Navy ships using other technologies reached 27\u00a0kn (50\u00a0km/h; 31\u00a0mph). Part of the speed improvement came from the slender hull of the Turbinia.[12]\n Within two years the destroyers HMS Viper and Cobra were launched with Parsons' turbines, soon followed by the first turbine-powered passenger ship, Clyde steamer TS King Edward in 1901; the first turbine transatlantic liners RMS Victorian and Virginian in 1905; and the first turbine-powered battleship, HMS\u00a0Dreadnought in 1906, all of them driven by Parsons' turbine engines.[10] (As of 2012[update] Turbinia is housed in a purpose-built gallery at the Discovery Museum, Newcastle.[13])\n Parsons was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1898, and received their Rumford Medal in 1902, their Copley Medal in 1928, and delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1918.[14] He served as the president of the British Association from 1916 to 1919.[15] He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1924 at Toronto.[16] Knighted in 1911, he became  a member of the Order of Merit in 1927.[17] In 1929 the Iron and Steel Institute awarded him the Bessemer Gold Medal.[18]\n The Parsons turbine company survives in the Heaton area of Newcastle as part of Siemens, a German  conglomerate. Sometimes referred to as Siemens Parsons, the company recently[when?] completed a major redevelopment programme, reducing the size of its site by around three-quarters and installing the latest manufacturing technology.[citation needed] In 1925 Charles Parsons acquired the Grubb Telescope Company and renamed it Grubb Parsons. That company survived in the Newcastle area until 1985.[citation needed]\n Parsons also designed the Auxetophone, an early compressed-air gramophone.[19]\n In 1883, Parsons married Katharine Bethell, the daughter of William F. Bethell. They had two children: the engineer and campaigner Rachel Mary Parsons (b. 1885), and Algernon George \"Tommy\" Parsons (b. 1886), who was killed in action during World War I in 1918, aged 31.[20]\n They had a London home at 1 Upper Brook Street, Mayfair, from 1918 to 1931. [21]\n Sir Charles Algernon Parsons died on 11 February 1931, on board the steamship Duchess of Richmond while on a cruise with his wife. The cause of death was given as neuritis.[22] A memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey on 3 March 1931.[23] Parsons was buried in the parish church of St Bartholomew's in Kirkwhelpington in Northumberland.[24][25]\n His widow, Katharine, died at her home in Ray Demesne, Kirkwhelpington, Northumberland in 1933.[26] Rachel Parsons died in 1956; stableman Denis James Pratt was convicted of her manslaughter.[27]\n In 1919, Katharine and her daughter Rachel co-founded the Women's Engineering Society with Eleanor Shelley-Rolls, Margaret, Lady Moir, Laura Annie Willson, Margaret Rowbotham and Janetta Mary Ornsby, which is still in existence today. Sir Charles was initially a supportive member of the organisation until his wife's resignation.[28][20]\n Parsons' ancestral home at Birr Castle in Ireland houses a museum detailing the contribution the Parsons family have made to the fields of science and engineering, with part of the museum given over to the engineering work of Charles Parsons.[29]\n Sir Charles Parsons is depicted on the reverse of an Irish silver 15 Euros silver Proof coin that was struck in 2017.[30]\n The Irish Academy of Engineering awards The Parsons Medal, named after Charles Parson, every year to an engineer that has made an exceptional contribution to the practice of engineering. Previous winners include Prof. Tony Fagan (2016), Dr. Edmond Harty (2017), Prof. Sir John McCanny (2018) and Michael McLaughlin (2019).[31]\n ", "tags": ["1854 births", "1931 deaths", "19th-century Anglo-Irish people", "20th-century Anglo-Irish people", "Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge", "Alumni of Trinity College Dublin", "Bessemer Gold Medal", "English engineers", "English knights", "English inventors", "British steam engine engineers", "British inventors", "Corresponding Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Irish engineers", "Irish knights", "Irish inventors", "Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath", "Marine engine manufacturers", "Members of the Order of Merit", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "People associated with electricity", "People from County Offaly", "Engineers from Tyne and Wear", "Presidents of the British Science Association", "Presidents of the Institute of Physics", "Recipients of the Copley Medal", "Steam turbines", "Turbines", "Younger sons of earls", "Women's Engineering Society", "CS1 maint: bot: original URL status unknown", "CS1: long volume value", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from June 2020", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from June 2020", "Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from February 2021", "Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2012", "All articles containing potentially dated statements", "All articles with vague or ambiguous time", "Vague or ambiguous time from February 2021", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2021", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the ODNB", "Pages using cite ODNB with id parameter", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with DIB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Inventor of the steam turbine\n\n\nThe Honourable Sir Charles Algernon ParsonsBorn13 June 1854London, England, United Kingdom of Great Britain and IrelandDied11 February 1931\u00a0(1931-02-12) (aged\u00a076)Kingston Harbour, Colony of Jamaica,NationalityAnglo-IrishCitizenshipBritish subjectAlma\u00a0materTrinity College, Dublin St. John's College, CambridgeKnown\u00a0forSteam turbineSpouse(s)Katharine Bethell (m. 1883) (d. 1933)ChildrenRachel Mary Parsons (1885\u20131956)Algernon George Parsons (b. 1886\u20131918)AwardsRumford Medal (1902)Albert Medal (1911)Franklin Medal (1920) Faraday Medal (1923) Copley Medal (1928) Bessemer Gold Medal (1929)Scientific careerFieldsEngineeringInstitutionsHeaton, Newcastle\n\nThe Honourable Sir Charles Algernon Parsons, OM, KCB, FRS (13 June 1854 \u2013 11 February 1931) was an Anglo-Irish engineer, best known for his invention of the compound steam turbine,[1] and as the namesake of C.\u00a0A.\u00a0Parsons and Company.
