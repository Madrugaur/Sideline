From 1881-83, he studied abroad on a scholarship from the academy.[2]\n From 1883-93, Nyrop worked as an assistant for professor Hans J\u00f8rgen Holm but was at the same time able to work on his personal commissions. Mist of his early independent works were single-family detached homes.\n He experienced a breakthrough when he won the competition for the design of the buildings at the Nordic Exhibition of 1888. He constructed all his exhibition pavilions of wood at a time when iron and glass was favored for temporary structures. He justified the decision by claiming the result would be prettier for the same cost. His background as a carpenter may have been an influence and it gave him the opportunity to showcase his ideals of quality materials and visible construction principles.\n Nyrop was awarded the Grand Prix for design at the Exposition Universelle at Paris in 1900. In 1906, he became a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts School of Architecture and served as director of the  Academy of Fine Arts for periods between 1908-18.[3]\n Nyrop designed the Copenhagen City Hall (1905) in National Romantic style and the majority of the buildings for the Nordic Industrial, Agricultural and Art Exhibition in Copenhagen (1888).\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n Nyrop married Louise Frederikke Laub (b. 1851), daughter of parish priest  Hans J\u00f8rgen Trojel Laub (1817\u20131863) and Ernestine Laub n\u00e9e Linnemann (1827\u201385), on 15 August 1885 in Trinitatis Church in Copenhagen.
