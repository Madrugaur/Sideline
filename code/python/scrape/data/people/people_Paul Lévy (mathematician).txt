{"name": "Paul L\u00e9vy (mathematician)", "content": "Local time\nCentral limit theoremL\u00e9vy's arcsine law\n Paul Pierre L\u00e9vy (15 September 1886 \u2013 15 December 1971)[2] was a  French mathematician who was active especially in probability theory, introducing fundamental concepts  such as local time, stable distributions and characteristic functions.   L\u00e9vy processes, L\u00e9vy flights, L\u00e9vy measures, L\u00e9vy's constant, the L\u00e9vy distribution, the L\u00e9vy area, the L\u00e9vy arcsine law, and the fractal L\u00e9vy C curve are  named after him.\n L\u00e9vy was born in Paris to a Jewish family which already included several mathematicians.[3] His father Lucien L\u00e9vy was an examiner at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. L\u00e9vy  attended the \u00c9cole Polytechnique and published his first paper in 1905, at the age of nineteen, while still an undergraduate, in which he introduced the L\u00e9vy\u2013Steinitz theorem.  His teacher and advisor was Jacques Hadamard.  After graduation, he spent a year in military service and then studied for three years at the \u00c9cole des Mines, where he became a professor in 1913.[2]\n During World War I L\u00e9vy conducted mathematical analysis work for the French Artillery. In 1920 he was appointed Professor of Analysis at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, where his students included Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot and Georges Matheron. He remained at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique until his retirement in 1959, with a gap during World War II after his 1940 firing because of the Vichy Statute on Jews.[2]\n L\u00e9vy made many fundamental contributions to probability theory and the nascent theory of stochastic processes. \nHe introduced the notion of 'stable distribution' which share the property of stability under addition of independent variables and proved a general version of the Central Limit theorem, recorded in his 1937 book Th\u00e9orie de l'addition des variables al\u00e9atoires, using the notion of characteristic function. He also introduced, independently from Ya. Khinchine, the notion of infinitely divisible law and derived their characterization through the L\u00e9vy\u2013Khintchine representation.\n His 1948 monograph on Brownian motion, Processus stochastiques et mouvement brownien, contains a wealth of new concepts and results, including the L\u00e9vy area, the L\u00e9vy arcsine law\nthe  local time of a Brownian path and many other results.\n L\u00e9vy received a number of honours, including membership at the French Academy of Sciences and honorary membership at the London Mathematical Society.\n His daughter Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Schwartz and son-in-law Laurent Schwartz were also notable mathematicians.[4]\n ", "tags": ["Paul L\u00e9vy (mathematician)", "Jewish French scientists", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni", "Mines ParisTech alumni", "Corps des mines", "1886 births", "1971 deaths", "20th-century French mathematicians", "French Jews", "Probability theorists", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with L\u00e9onore identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French mathematician\nFor other uses, see Paul L\u00e9vy (disambiguation).\nPaul L\u00e9vyPaul Pierre L\u00e9vyBorn(1886-09-15)15 September 1886Paris, FranceDied15 December 1971(1971-12-15) (aged\u00a085)Paris, FranceNationalityFrenchAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ParisKnown\u00a0forStudy of fine properties of Brownian motion\nLocal time\nCentral limit theoremL\u00e9vy's arcsine law\n\nL\u00e9vy processL\u00e9vy flightL\u00e9vy measureL\u00e9vy's constant L\u00e9vy distributionL\u00e9vy C curveAwardsEmile Picard Medal of the French Academy of Sciences (1953)[1]Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutions\u00c9cole Polytechnique\u00c9cole des MinesDoctoral advisorJacques HadamardVito VolterraDoctoral studentsWolfgang DoeblinMichel Lo\u00e8veBeno\u00eet MandelbrotGeorges MatheronInfluencedKiyosi Ito Benoit Mandelbrot Marc Yor\n\nPaul Pierre L\u00e9vy (15 September 1886 \u2013 15 December 1971)[2] was a  French mathematician who was active especially in probability theory, introducing fundamental concepts  such as local time, stable distributions and characteristic functions.
