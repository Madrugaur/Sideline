He designs and supervises over construction of 15 multiple-arch and concrete bridges in the Ukrainian SSR, including regions of the Dnipropetrovsk oblast, works in special board on locking the Dnieper river. Under his projects and supervision there were built the arch and concrete bridge in the Hloba park, buildings of the sewing and shoe factories in Dnipropetrovsk. He contributed to the creation of the industrial base of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station and organization of industrial construction of the Dneprostal enterprise.\n He worked as a teacher in the Katerynoslavska Building Technical Evening School, since 1930 - in Dnipropetrovsk Building Institute on positions of the deputy director on educational and research work, chief of the chairs of organization of construction works, and construction operations. From 1932 \u2013 he is a member of editorial board of the editorial-publishing house \u00abState Building Technical Publishing\u00bb. He works as research supervisor of the scientific and research sector of the Institute. In 1937-1938 he acted as director of the Institute,[1] later \u2013 worked as deputy director of the Institute.\n Prof. O.A. Harmash worked in the field of production line methods in construction. His research was focused, among other things, on liquidation of seasonality in construction activities: in 1931 he publishes his book \u00abConstruction activities in winter\u00bb, in 1933 he begins his experimental work on electric heating of concrete.
