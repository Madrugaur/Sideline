Baker Professor of Administration. He is also a former non-executive director of Tata Sons.\n Nitin Nohria was born in Nohar Rajasthan in baniya (traders) family, India. His father, Kewal Nohria, was the former chairman of Crompton Greaves in India, and was an influence upon Nohria's decision to embark upon a career in business.[1]\n Nohria attended high school at St. Columba's School in New Delhi, India. He earned a B.Tech in Chemical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, graduating in 1984, and then received an MBA from Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies at the University of Mumbai. He earned a PhD in Management from the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1988.[2]\n Nohria served as co-chair of the HBS Leadership Initiative and sat on the executive committee of the University's interfaculty initiative on advanced leadership. Nohria is working with fellow HBS professor Rakesh Khurana, the World Economic Forum and the Aspen Institute to create a business oath, like the MBA Oath, [1] that might be used globally.[3]  In a Harvard Business Review piece published in October 2008, Khurana and Nohria linked the connection between professionalism of a profession and the profession's ability to deliver value to society:[4]\n On May 4, 2010, Drew Gilpin Faust, President of Harvard University, appointed him Dean of Harvard Business School, effective July 1, 2010.[5] He is the second HBS Dean, after John H. McArthur, born outside the United States and the first Dean since Dean Fouraker in the 1970s to live in the Dean's House on the HBS campus.[6] In January 2014, he tendered an apology on behalf of Harvard Business School for the perceived sexism at the school.[7]\n In August 2017, Nohria argued that President Donald Trump's support for \"isolationism\" was detrimental to American economic prosperity, as it discouraged successful foreigners from immigrating to the United States.[8]\n In November 2019, Nohria announced that he would step down as dean in June 2020 but, in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, Nohria decided to stay on as dean through the end of 2020.
