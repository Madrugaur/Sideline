Pogorelov:  (19919) Pogorelov\u00a0[fr].\n By the beginning of the 20th century, the methods for solving of local problems related to regular surfaces were developed. By the thirties, there were developed the methods for solving the problems in geometry \"in the large\". These methods were related mainly to the theory of partial differential equations. Mathematicians were helpless when surfaces were non-smooth (for example, with conical points, ribbed points, etc.) and when the intrinsic geometry was given not by a smooth positive definite quadratic form, but simply by a metric space of a fairly general form. A breakthrough in the study of non-smooth metrics and non-smooth surfaces was made by an outstanding geometer A.D. Aleksandrov. He developed the theory of metric spaces of non-negative curvature, so-called Aleksandrov metric spaces. As a special case, the theory covered the intrinsic geometry of general convex surfaces, that is boundaries of convex bodies. Aleksandrov studied connections between the intrinsic and extrinsic geometries of general convex surfaces. He proved that every metric of non-negative curvature given on a two-dimensional sphere (including non-smooth metrics, so-called inner metrics) can be isometrically immersed into the three-dimensional Euclidean space in a form of a closed convex surface, but the answers to the following fundamental questions were unknown:\n After solving these problems, the theory created by Aleksandrov would have received \u201cfull citizenship\u201d in mathematics and could be applied also in the classical regular case. Each of these 3 questions was answered positively by A.V. Pogorelov. Using synthetic geometric methods, he developed geometric methods to obtain priori estimates for solutions of Monge-Amp\u00e8re equations. On the one hand, he used these equations to solve geometric problems; on the other hand, based on geometric reasons, he constructed a generalized solution of a Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation and then proved its regularity for a regular right-hand side of the equation. In fact, in these pioneering works A.V. Pogorelov laid the foundation of the field of geometric analysis. He proved the following fundamental results:\n For domains on convex surfaces assertions 1) and 2) are false. The local and global properties of surfaces are significantly different. By proving assertion 1)  A.V.  Pogorelov completed the solution of the problem open for more than a century. The first result in this direction was obtained by Cauchy for closed convex polyhedra in 1813.\n The theorems proved by Pogorelov formed the basis for his nonlinear theory of thin shells. This theory is concerned with those elastic states of the shell which differ significantly comparing to the original form. Under such deformations, the middle surface of a thin shell undergoes bending with preservation of the metric. This makes it possible, by using theorems proved by Pogorelov for convex surfaces, to investigate loss of stability and the over critical elastic state of convex shells under a given strain. Such shells are the most common elements of modern designs.\n Results 1) and 2) were generalized for regular surfaces in a Riemannian space. In addition, the Weyl problem for Riemannian space was solved: it was proved that a regular metric of Gaussian curvature greater than some constant c on a two-dimensional sphere can be isometrically immersed into a complete three-dimensional Riemannian space of curvature <c  in a form of a regular surface. Studying the methods developed in the proof of this result, the Abel Prize laureate M. Gromov introduced the concept of pseudoholomorphic curves, which are the main tool in modern symplectic geometry.\n A closed convex hypersurface is uniquely defined not only by the metric but also by the Gaussian curvature as a function of unit normals. Moreover, the hypersurface is uniquely determined up to a parallel transport. This was proved by G. Minkowski. But is the hypersurface  regular under the condition that the Gaussian curvature K(n) is a regular function of a unit normal?  Pogorelov proved that if positive function K(n) belongs to the class \u0421k, k\u22653, then the support function will be of regularity class \u0421k+1,v, 0<v<1.\n The hardest part of the proof of the theorem was to obtain a priori estimates for the derivatives of the support function of a hypersurface up to third order inclusively. Pogorelov's method of a priori estimates was used by S.-T. Yau to obtain a priori estimates for solutions of complex Monge-Ampere equations. This was the main step in the proof of the existence of Calabi-Yao manifolds, which play an important role in theoretical physics. A Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation has the form\n A priori estimates in the Minkowski problem are a priori for the solution of the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation with the function\n At that time there was no approach to studying this completely nonlinear equation. A. V. Pogorelov has created the theory of the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation by using the geometric methods. First, going from polyhedra, he proved the existence of generalized solutions under natural conditions on the right-hand side. After that he has found the a priori estimates for the derivatives up to the third order inclusively for the regular solutions. Using the a priori estimates, he has proved the regularity of strictly convex solutions, the existence of solutions of the Dirichlet problem and their regularity. The Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation is an essential component of the Monge-Kantorovich transport problem; it is used in conformal, affine, K\u00e4hler geometries, in meteorology and in financial mathematics. A.V. Pogorelov once said about the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation: this is a great equation with which I had the honor to work.\n One of the most conceptual works of A. V. Pogorelov refers to the cycle of works about smooth surfaces of bounded external curvature.  A.D. Aleksandrov created a theory of general metric manifolds that naturally generalize Riemannian manifolds. In particular, he introduced the class of two-dimensional manifolds of bounded curvature. They exhaust the class of all metrized two-dimensional manifolds that admit, in a neighborhood of each point, a uniform approximation by Riemannian metrics with absolute integral curvature (i.e., the integral of the module of Gaussian curvature) bounded in aggregate.\n Naturally, the question arose about the class of surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space carrying such a metric with preservation of connections between the metric and the extrinsic geometry of the surface. Partially answering this question, A.V. Pogorelov introduced the class of \u04211-smooth surfaces with the requirement on the area of a spherical image to be bounded, taking into account the multiplicity of the covering in some neighborhood of each point of the surface. Such surfaces are called surfaces of bounded extrinsic curvature.\n For such surfaces there is also a very close connection between the intrinsic geometry of the surface and its extrinsic shape: a complete surface with a bounded extrinsic curvature and a nonnegative intrinsic curvature (not equal to zero) is either a closed convex surface or an unbounded convex surface; a complete surface with zero intrinsic curvature and bounded extrinsic curvature is a cylinder.\n The first work of A. V. Pogorelov on surfaces of bounded extrinsic curvature was published in 1953. In 1954, J. Nash published the paper on \u04211-isometric immersions, which was improved by N. Kuiper in 1955. It follows from these studies that a Riemannian metric defined on a two-dimensional manifold, under very general assumptions, admits a realization on a \u04211-smooth surface in a three-dimensional Euclidean space. Moreover, this realization is carried out as freely as a topological immersion into the space of the manifold on which the metric is given.  Hence it is clear that for \u04211-surfaces, even with a good intrinsic metric, it is impossible to preserve the connections between the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures. Even in case if a \u04211-surface carries a regular metric of positive Gaussian curvature, then this does not imply the local convexity of the surface. This emphasizes the naturalness of the class of surfaces of bounded external curvature introduced by A. V. Pogorelov.\n A. V. Pogorelov solved Hilbert's fourth problem, set by D. Hilbert at the II International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. He found all, up to isomorphism, realizations of the systems of axioms of classical geometries (Euclid, Lobachevsky and elliptic) if one omits the congruence axioms containing the concept of angle and supplement these systems with the axiom of \"triangle inequality\".\n A. V. Pogorelov was one of the first who has proposed (in 1970) a new idea in the construction of a cryoturbogenerator with superconducting field winding and took an active part in technical calculations and creation of corresponding industrial samples.\n ", "tags": ["1919 births", "2002 deaths", "People from Korochansky District", "20th-century mathematicians", "Ukrainian people of Russian descent", "Ukrainian mathematicians", "Ukrainian physicists", "Soviet mathematicians", "Soviet physicists", "20th-century physicists", "Differential geometers", "National University of Kharkiv alumni", "Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences", "Full Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences", "Stalin Prize winners", "Textbook writers", "Articles needing cleanup from June 2019", "All pages needing cleanup", "Cleanup tagged articles with a reason field from June 2019", "Wikipedia pages needing cleanup from June 2019", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Articles containing Ukrainian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.
