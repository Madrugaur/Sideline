{"name": "Max Bielschowsky", "content": "\n Max Israel Bielschowsky (20 February 1869 \u2013 15 August 1940) was a German neuropathologist born in Breslau.[1]\n After receiving his medical doctorate from the University of Munich in 1893, he worked with Ludwig Edinger (1855\u20131918) at the Senckenberg Pathology Institute in Frankfurt-am-Main. At Senckenberg he learned histological staining techniques from Carl Weigert (1845\u20131904). From 1896 to 1904 he worked in Emanuel Mendel's (1839\u20131907) psychiatric laboratory in Berlin. In 1904 he joined Oskar Vogt (1870\u20131959) at the neurobiological laboratory at the University of Berlin, where he remained until 1933. Later in his career he worked at the psychiatric clinic at the University of Utrecht, and at the Cajal Institute in Madrid.[2] He emigrated to the UK, where he died on 15 August 1940 in the Greater London area at 71 years of age.[3] His oldest son, Franz David Bielschowsky, also emigrated to Sheffield, UK and subsequently to Dunedin, New Zealand where he pursued an eminent career in cancer research.[4] A cousin of Max Bielschowsky, Albert Bielschowsky (1847\u20131902), was a biographer of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.[4]\n Bielschowsky made important contributions in his research of tuberous sclerosis, amaurotic idiocy, paralysis agitans, Huntington\u2019s chorea and myotonia congenita. He is remembered for his histopathological work with disseminated sclerosis, the use of an histological silver stain for impregnation of nerve fibers, and with Stanley Cobb, the development of intravital[5] silver staining. The eponymous \"Bielschowsky silver stain\" technique was an improvement on the method developed by Ramon y Cajal (1852\u20131934).[2]\n ", "tags": ["1869 births", "1940 deaths", "German pathologists", "Polish pathologists", "German histologists", "Physicians from Wroc\u0142aw", "Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United Kingdom", "People from the Province of Silesia", "Use dmy dates from February 2021", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\n Max Bielschowsky (1869\u20131940)\nMax Israel Bielschowsky (20 February 1869 \u2013 15 August 1940) was a German neuropathologist born in Breslau.[1]\nAfter receiving his medical doctorate from the University of Munich in 1893, he worked with Ludwig Edinger (1855\u20131918) at the Senckenberg Pathology Institute in Frankfurt-am-Main.
