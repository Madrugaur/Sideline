{"name": "Roger Ap\u00e9ry", "content": "Roger Ap\u00e9ry (French:\u00a0[ape\u0281i]; 14 November 1916, Rouen \u2013 18 December 1994, Caen) was a Greek-French mathematician most remembered for Ap\u00e9ry's theorem, which states that \u03b6(3) is an irrational number. Here, \u03b6(s) denotes the Riemann zeta function.\n Ap\u00e9ry was born in Rouen in 1916 to a French mother and Greek father. His childhood was spent in Lille until 1926, when the family moved to Paris, where he studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Ledru-Rollin and the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand.  He was admitted  at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in 1935.  His studies were interrupted at the start of World War II; he was mobilized in September 1939, taken prisoner of war in June 1940, repatriated with pleurisy in June 1941, and hospitalized until August 1941. He wrote his doctoral thesis in algebraic geometry under the direction of Paul Dubreil and Ren\u00e9 Garnier in 1947.\n In 1947 Ap\u00e9ry was appointed Ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences (lecturer) at the University of Rennes. In 1949 he was appointed Professor at the University of Caen, where he remained until his retirement.\n In 1979 he published an unexpected proof of the irrationality of \u03b6(3), which is the sum of the inverses of the cubes of the positive integers. An indication of the difficulty is that the corresponding problem for other odd powers remains unsolved. Nevertheless, many mathematicians have since worked on the so-called Ap\u00e9ry sequences to seek alternative proofs that might apply to other odd powers (Frits Beukers, Alfred van der Poorten, Marc Pr\u00e9vost, Keith Ball, Tanguy Rivoal, Wadim Zudilin, and others).\n Ap\u00e9ry was active in politics and for a few years in the 1960s was president of the Calvados Radical Party of the Left. He abandoned politics after the reforms instituted by Edgar Faure after the 1968 revolt, when he realised that university life was running against the tradition he had always upheld.\n Ap\u00e9ry married in 1947 and had three sons, including mathematician Fran\u00e7ois Ap\u00e9ry. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1971. He then remarried in 1972 and divorced in 1977.\n In 1994, Ap\u00e9ry died from Parkinson's disease after a long illness in Caen. He was buried next to his parents at the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. His tombstone has a mathematical inscription stating his theorem.\n ", "tags": ["1916 births", "1994 deaths", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni", "Greek mathematicians", "University of Caen faculty", "Number theorists", "French people of Greek descent", "20th-century French mathematicians", "French prisoners of war in World War II", "University of Rennes faculty", "Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand alumni", "Deaths from Parkinson's disease", "Burials at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery", "People from Rouen", "French military personnel of World War II", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French mathematician\nRoger Ap\u00e9ryBorn(1916-11-14)14 November 1916Rouen, FranceDied18 December 1994(1994-12-18) (aged\u00a078)Caen, FranceNationalityFrenchEducationLyc\u00e9e Louis-le-GrandAlma\u00a0mater\u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieureOccupationMathematician\nRoger Ap\u00e9ry (French:\u00a0[ape\u0281i]; 14 November 1916, Rouen \u2013 18 December 1994, Caen) was a Greek-French mathematician most remembered for Ap\u00e9ry's theorem, which states that \u03b6(3) is an irrational number.
