He is a winner of the Sz\u00e9chenyi Prize.\nPaul Erd\u0151s's favorite \"child\", he discovered theorems at the age of 16. Since 2002, he has worked at the R\u00e9nyi Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; earlier he was at the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, at the Departments of Mathematical Analysis, Computer Science.\n He was born in Budapest, Hungary on December 9, 1947. His father was a chemist, his mother a mathematics teacher. He was a child prodigy. While still in elementary school, the educator R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter, friend of his mother introduced him to Paul Erd\u0151s, who invited him\nfor lunch in a restaurant, and bombarded him with mathematical questions. P\u00f3sa finished the problems sooner than his soup, which impressed Erd\u0151s, who himself had been a child prodigy, and who supported young talents with much care and competence. That is how P\u00f3sa\u2019s first paper was born, co-authored with Erd\u0151s (hence his Erd\u0151s number is 1).\n He went to the first special mathematics class of the country at Fazekas Mih\u00e1ly Secondary School from 1962 to 1966, where his classmates included Mikl\u00f3s Laczkovich, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz, J\u00f3zsef Pelik\u00e1n, Zsolt Baranyai, Istv\u00e1n Berkes, Katalin Vesztergombi, P\u00e9ter Major. He won the first prize on the International Mathematical Olympiad in 1966 (Bulgaria) and second prize in 1965 (Germany).[1]\n He started his Mathematics studies at ELTE University in 1966, and graduated in 1971. From 1971 to 1982 he worked at the Department of Mathematical Analysis at ELTE University, and he obtained a doctorate in 1983 with his dissertation about Hamiltonian circuits of random graphs. From 1984 to 2002 he worked at the Department of Computer Science at ELTE University, and since 2002 he has been a member of the R\u00e9nyi Mathematical Institute.\n Despite his significant results in mathematical research, he stopped research and devoted himself fully to Mathematics Education. Erd\u0151s, who preferred him among all his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, expressed his regret that P\u00f3sa had stopped research with the typical Erd\u0151s style phrase \"P\u00f3sa is dead.\"\n He started teaching mathematics very early. He tutored his secondary school classmates, and during his first year at university he started teaching extracurricular courses at his former secondary school. His students at that time included: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai, Gy\u00f6rgy Elekes, P\u00e9ter Komj\u00e1th, Imre Z. Ruzsa.\n At the beginning of the 1970s he got involved with the school reform movement called complex teaching of mathematics led by Tam\u00e1s Varga. P\u00f3sa worked on the reform of secondary mathematics teaching, while he taught at Radn\u00f3ti Mikl\u00f3s Secondary School from 1976 to 1980. From 1982 to 1989 he was a member of the Research Group on Mathematics Education led by J\u00e1nos Sur\u00e1nyi. From 1982 to 1991 he had two experimental\nclasses at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s J\u00f3zsef Secondary School. His teaching materials written at that time were tested in several classes, and based on these he and colleagues have written a textbook series for the four years of secondary school.\n Nevertheless, P\u00f3sa is best known for finding and teaching gifted students. Since 1988 he has been organizing his own week-end maths camps. There are several groups of 20-35 students, and each group has two or three camps a year. In a camp, students mostly work in groups of\n2-4, but there are also plenary sessions where they discuss solutions, and sum up important thoughts. Students work on problems carefully built on each other. There are several topics running parallelly, and one topic spans several camps. The emphasis is on thinking, proving, and the connection between seemingly distant ideas. The camps are also an important scene of teacher training, as prospective teachers observe and help in the camps.\n ", "tags": ["Hungarian mathematicians", "Combinatorialists", "1947 births", "Living people", "Officer's Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary (civil)", "International Mathematical Olympiad participants", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian mathematician\nThe native form of this personal name is P\u00f3sa Lajos.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nLajos P\u00f3sa (born December 9, 1947 in Budapest) is a Hungarian mathematician working in the topic of combinatorics, and one of the most prominent mathematics educators of Hungary, best known for his mathematics camps for gifted students.

D. Korshunov). The result  was later improved by Koml\u00f3s and Szemer\u00e9di.[3]\nWith Erd\u0151s he proved the Erd\u0151s\u2013P\u00f3sa theorem.\nPrizes, awards[edit]\nPrize for Children Support (\u201eGyermekek\u00e9rt\u201d d\u00edj), 1989\nBeke Man\u00f3 Prize I. degree by Bolyai J\u00e1nos Mathematical Society, 1994\nOfficer\u2019s Cross Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, 1998\nCharles Simonyi Scholarship, 2000\nMOL prize for Gifted Education (\u201cTehets\u00e9ggondoz\u00e1s\u00e9rt\u201d d\u00edj), 2008\nSz\u00e9chenyi Prize, 2011\nPublications[edit]\nP\u00f3sa Lajos: A pr\u00edmsz\u00e1mok egy tulajdons\u00e1g\u00e1r\u00f3l, Matematikai Lapok, 11 (1960), 124-128.\nP.
