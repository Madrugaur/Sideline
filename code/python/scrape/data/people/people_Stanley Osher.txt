These methods have been widely used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and related fields.\nTotal variation (TV)-based image restoration (with Rudin and Fatemi) and shock filters (with Rudin). These are pioneering -  and widely used - methods for PDE based image processing and have also been used for inverse problems.\nLevel-set method (with Sethian) for capturing moving interfaces, which has been phenomenally successful as a key tool in PDE based image processing and computer vision, as well as applications in differential geometry, image segmentation, inverse problems, optimal design, Two-phase flow, crystal growth, deposition and etching.\nBregman iteration and augmented Lagrangian type methods for L1 and L1-related optimization problems which are fundamental to the fields of compressed sensing, matrix completion, robust principal component analysis, etc.\nOvercoming the curse of dimensionality for Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equations arising in control theory and differential games.\nOsher has founded (or co-founded) three successful companies:\n\nCognitech (with Rudin)\nLevel Set Systems\nLuminescent Technologies (with Yablonovitch)\nOsher has been a thesis advisor for at least 53 PhD students, with 188 descendants, as well as postdoctoral adviser and collaborator for many applied mathematicians.
