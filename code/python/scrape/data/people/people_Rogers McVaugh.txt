He specialised in the Compositae, Myrtaceae, Campanulaceae, woody Rosaceae, and the flora of Mexico, as well as botanical history and nomenclature.[2]\n McVaugh was an expert in the field, especially of neotropical families and collected extensively in western Mexico particularly in the 1930s and 1940s.[3] These are held in several herbaria in the USA, particularly over 23,000 specimens in the Herbarium of the University of Michigan.  Other herbaria with smaller collections include those in University of North Carolina, University of Georgia and University of California.[1]\n McVaugh published about 12 books and 200 shorter articles in history of botany, floristics and systematic botany. These included: \n McVaugh's last, partially completed work was the Flora Novo-Galiciana, a multi-volume work focusing on the diverse flora of this region in western Mexico.\n McVaugh and Ruth Beall were married in 1937.
