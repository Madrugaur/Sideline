{"name": "Adele Racheli", "content": "Adele Racheli was an Italian engineer and co-founder of a successful patent protection office in Milan in 1925 to protect the intellectual property of Italian professionals. The firm still thrives. \n Born around 1894 in Piacenza, Italy, Racheli had seven younger brothers. As a way to improve her understanding of the lessons she learned in school, she copied her class notes by hand at night and then sold them to her classmates.[1][2] In Piacenza, she attended high school and two years of university, but after her family moved to Milan, she was one of the first women to enroll at  the Polytechnic University of Milan, graduating in industrial mechanical engineering in 1920.[2]\n When she was interviewed in 1985, she admitted that her early fascination with mechanics came from a passion to fix bicycles, which in those days, always broke down. Even so, she commented on her life's achievements saying it mattered little if her family \"thought she was crazy.\"[2]\n One of Racheli's first jobs was working in a Milan patent office, which became a transformative experience, teaching her the importance of protecting intellectual property. In 1925, she opened her own patent protection office in Milan called the Racheli & Bossi Patent Office, in partnership with a colleague Rosita Bossi.[1][3] The name of the company has since been shortened to Racheli and now operates two other offices in Italy in addition to the main location in Milan. As of 2020, the company describes itself as a \"consultancy firm in industrial and intellectual property, which operates in Italy and abroad also through a selected network of consultants and correspondents.\"[3][4]\n Racheli married an engineer named Domenighetti who had attended the same university. This led her to change her name to Adele Racheli Domenighetti. In her 1985 interview, \"she boasts of having always managed to earn more than him, who was also a mechanical engineer and had his own company to run.\"[2]\n On 26 January 1957, Racheli was a founder of a new organization to support female professionals. To do so, she worked with engineers Emma Strada, Anna E. Armour, Ines Del Tetto Noto, Laura Lange, Alessandra Bonfanti Vietti and the architect Vittoria Ilardi, to establish the Italian Association of Women Engineers and Architects (Associazione Italiana Donne Architetto e Ingegnere \u2013 AIDIA).
