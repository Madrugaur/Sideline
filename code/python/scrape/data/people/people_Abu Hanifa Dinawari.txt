His ancestry came from the region of Dinawar, in Kermanshah in modern-day western Iran. He was instructed in the two main traditions of the Abbasid-era grammarians of al-Ba\u1e63rah and of al-K\u016bfah. His principal teachers were Ibn al-Sikk\u012bt and his own father.[n 1]  He studied grammar, philology, geometry, arithmetic, and astronomy and was known to be a reliable traditionist.[1]\nHis most renowned contribution is Book of Plants, for which he is considered the founder of Arabic botany.[2]\nDinawari was said to have been of Persian origin.[3][4][5][6][7] Although he was also said to have been Kurdish,[8] or Arab of Persian ancestry.[9][10] He may have studied astronomy in Isfahan.[citation needed].\n The tenth century biographical encyclopedia, \"al-Fihrist\" of Al-Nadim, lists sixteen book titles by Dinawari:[1]\n His General History (Al-Akhbar al-Tiwal) has been edited and published numerous times (Vladimir Guirgass, 1888; Muhammad Sa'id Rafi'i, 1911; Ignace Krachkovsky, 1912;[13] 'Abd al-Munim 'Amir & Jamal al-din Shayyal, 1960; Isam Muhammad al-Hajj 'Ali, 2001), but has not been translated in its entirety into a European language. Jackson Bonner has recently prepared an English translation of the pre-Islamic passages of al-Akhbar al-Tiwal.[14]\n Al-Dinawari is considered the founder of Arabic botany for his Kitab al-Nabat (Book of Plants), which consisted of six volumes. Only the third and fifth volumes have survived, though the sixth volume has partly been reconstructed based on citations from later works. In the surviving portions of his works, 637 plants are described from the letters sin to ya. He describes the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit.[2]\n The first part of the Book of Plants describes astronomical and meteorological concepts as they relate to plants, including the planets and constellations, the sun and moon, the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain, anwa, and atmospheric phenomena such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, and floods. The book also describes different types of ground, indicating which types are more convenient for plants and the qualities and properties of good ground.[2]\n Al-Dinawari quoted from other early Muslim botanical works that are now lost, such as those of al-Shaybani, Ibn al-Arabi, al-Bahili, and Ibn as-Sikkit.\n ", "tags": ["815 births", "896 deaths", "9th-century Iranian people", "9th-century astronomers", "9th-century geographers", "9th-century historians", "9th-century Persian mathematicians", "9th-century philologists", "9th-century Arabic writers", "9th-century biologists", "9th-century botanists", "9th-century linguists", "9th-century scholars", "9th-century scientists", "9th-century writers", "9th-century zoologists", "Poets of the Abbasid Caliphate", "Scholars of the Abbasid Caliphate", "Iranian Arabists", "Astronomers of medieval Islam", "Botanists of medieval Islam", "Geographers of medieval Islam", "Grammarians of Arabic", "Grammarians of Kufa", "Kurdish scholars", "Kurdish scientists", "Linguists from Iran", "Mathematicians of medieval Islam", "Medieval grammarians of Arabic", "Medieval Kurdish philosophers", "Medieval Persian philosophers", "Medieval Persian astronomers", "Medieval Persian geographers", "People from Dinawar", "Persian Muslim historians of Islam", "Pre-Linnaean botanists", "Iranian grammarians", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "CS1 Arabic-language sources (ar)", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia introduction cleanup from February 2015", "All pages needing cleanup", "Articles covered by WikiProject Wikify from February 2015", "All articles covered by WikiProject Wikify", "Articles containing Persian-language text", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from May 2019", "Articles containing Arabic-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with TDV\u0130A identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Islamic polymath\n\"Dinawari\" redirects here.
