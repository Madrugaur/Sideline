{"name": "Hovannes Adamian", "content": "Hovhannes (Ivan) Abgari Adamian (5 February 1879 \u2013 12 September 1932) was an Armenian engineer, an author of more than 20 inventions. The first experimental color television was shown in London in 1928 based on Adamian's tricolor principle,[1] and he is recognized as one of the founders of color television.[2]\n Adamian was born in a  family of an Armenian merchant and petrol businessman.[3] In 1897, he finished his schooling in Baku and moved to Switzerland. He studied at the universities of Zurich and Berlin. He designed systems of black and white, as well as color televisions. Developing theoretical works by other co-founders of color television like M. Le Blanc and P. Nipkov, Adamian was the first in the world to achieve practical results in color television and to carry out color television transfers.[citation needed] The first color television project is claimed by him,[4] and was patented in Germany on 31 March 1908, patent \u2116 197183, then in Britain, on 1 April 1908, patent \u2116 7219,[5] in France (patent \u2116 390326) and in Russia in 1910 (patent \u2116 17912).[2]\n In 1925 in Yerevan, Adamian demonstrated \"Eristavi\", a device for broadcasting color images.

He had several long-term trips to Armenia before dying in 1932 in Leningrad. He was buried in the local Armenian cemetery and, in 1970, his remains were brought to Yerevan, to the Pantheon of famous Armenians.\n ", "tags": ["1879 births", "1932 deaths", "Armenian engineers", "Armenian inventors", "Armenian scientists", "Soviet engineers", "20th-century Russian engineers", "Soviet Armenians", "Soviet academics", "Soviet scientists", "Soviet inventors", "Engineers from Baku", "People from Baku Governorate", "Armenian people of the Russian Empire", "Engineers of the Russian Empire", "Television pioneers", "CS1 Russian-language sources (ru)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from October 2013", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": " Hovannes Adamian\nHovhannes (Ivan) Abgari Adamian (5 February 1879 \u2013 12 September 1932) was an Armenian engineer, an author of more than 20 inventions.
