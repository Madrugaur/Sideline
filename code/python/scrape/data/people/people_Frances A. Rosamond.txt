At the University of Newcastle, Australia, Rosamond developed a new program of computer games, and a guest-visitor seminar series. Since 1998, Rosamond and her husband Michael Fellows have provided workshops on the mathematical foundations of computer science to children and adults in many countries. Rosamond orchestrated Sonia Kovalevskia Mathematics Days for girls and their teachers when she was professor of mathematics at National University in San Diego (1986-2000), and was a promoter of the San Diego Science Alliance. She received a University of Newcastle HEEP Equity Award for her investigation into increasing the number of women in computer science.\n Rosamond has served on the Mathematics Association of America Committee on Mathematics and the Environment, Committee on Under-represented Minorities and Committee on the Teaching of Undergraduate Mathematics and, chaired the Task Force on Data Collection and Policy Issues. She was the representative to the JOINT-AMS-AWM-ASA-IMS-MAA-NCTM-SIAM Committee on Women in the Mathematical Sciences. Together with Sue Geller and Patricia Kenschaft, Frances developed and acted in the MAA Skit Program, a humorous presentation of recent discrimination events with disguised identities. Rosamond helped arrange for the Mathematical Association of America to be an official non-governmental organization of The United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women and to present workshops at the conference. Rosamond has served the mathematics education community as one of the original members of the Association for Women in Mathematics. She was an invited delegate to the first Women and Mathematics delegation to the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1991. She has served on the Board of Directors of the Women in Mathematics Education Association, and as a member of the \tNominations and Elections committee. She has been active in the American Educational Research Association, Greater San Diego Mathematics Council, and California Mathematics Council.\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "Australian women computer scientists", "Australian women mathematicians", "Cornell University alumni", "1943 births", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles lacking reliable references from September 2012", "All articles lacking reliable references", "BLP articles lacking sources from September 2012", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Publons identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Australian computer scientist\nThis biography of a living person relies too much on references to primary sources.
