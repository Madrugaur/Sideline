She grew up in South Central Los Angeles, moving to a better neighborhood in Los Angeles as a teenager. She went to Westchester High School[1] and attended summer enrichment programs for underrepresented students there that included courses at the University of California, Los Angeles and a field trip to see the Space Shuttle at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center on Edwards Air Force Base.[1][2] She graduated in 1991.[3]\n As an undergraduate at California State University, Long Beach, Cotwright-Williams started in engineering.  Then, as a math major, she struggled initially and earning low enough grades to be academically disqualified from the university, but worked hard to return as a student in good standing eventually earning a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 2000. She then earned a master's degree in mathematics from Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 2002.[1][4]\nInitially intending to follow a science & math Ph.D. track, she was persuaded to shift to pure mathematics under the mentorship of an African-American professor, Dr. Stella R.
