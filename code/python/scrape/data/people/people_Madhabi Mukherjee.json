{"name": "Madhabi Mukherjee", "content": "\n Madhabi Mukherjee, n\u00e9e Chakraborty, (born 10 February 1942) is an Indian actress. She won the National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in the Bengali film Dibratrir Kabya.[1] She has acted in some of the most critically acclaimed films in Bengali cinema and is considered one of the greatest actresses of Bengali cinema.[2][3]\n Madhabi Mukherjee was born on 10 February 1942 and was raised with her sister, Manjari, by their mother in Kolkata, in what was then Bengal, India. As a young girl, she became involved in the theater. One of the biggest stars to work with the best 5 films directors of West Bengal i.e. Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha and Rituparno Ghosh.\n She worked on stage with doyens such as Sisir Bhaduri, Ahindra Choudhury, Nirmalendu Lahiri and Chhabi Biswas. Some of the plays she acted in included Naa and Kalarah. She made her film debut as a child artist in Premendra Mitra's Dui beaee\"[citation needed].\n Mukherjee first made a major impact with Mrinal Sen's Baishey Shravan (Wedding Day) in 1960. The film is set in a Bengal village just before and during the horrific famine of 1943 in Bengal that saw over 5 million die. Mukherjee plays a 16-year-old girl who marries a middle-aged man. Initially, she brightens up his life but then World War II and the Bengal Famine hits them. The couple's marriage disintegrates.\n Her next major film was Ritwik Ghatak's Subarnarekha (The Golden Thread ) made in 1962, but released in 1965 \u2013 the last in a trilogy examining the socio-economic implications of partition, the other two being Meghe Dhaka Tara (The Cloud-Capped Star) (1960) and Komal Gandhar (E-Flat) (1961). It is also perhaps Ritwik Ghatak's most complex film[citation needed]. In the film, Ghatak depicts the economic and socio-political crisis of Bengal from 1948 to 1962; how the crisis has first and foremost left one bereft of one's conscience, one's moral sense. Mukherjee  plays Sita, the younger sister of Ishwar (Abhi Bhattacharya), who kills herself when\u2014as a prostitute waiting for her first customer\u2014she finds out the customer is none other than her estranged brother.\n In the early 1960s, she was recruited by Satyajit Ray to portray the role of Arati in the 1963 film Mahanagar (The Big City).\n Recalling her meeting with Ray, Mukherjee wrote:\n He read me the entire story, Mahanagar. I was stunned. This was the first woman-centered screenplay I had encountered. I was not going to play second fiddle to the main male character as in all plays and films I had acted in or was familiar with. (p.20) In Mahanagar, Mukherjee plays Arati, who takes a job as a saleswoman due to financial constraints in the family. The large joint family is horrified at the thought of a working woman. For Arati, going door to door selling knitting machines opens up a whole new world and new friends and acquaintances, including an Anglo-Indian friend, Edith. Earning money also raises Arati's status in the family especially when her husband (Anil Chatterjee) loses his job. When Edith is sacked unfairly, Arati resigns in protest...Mukherjee's towering performance as Arati dominates the film. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote: \"It might be useful to see the performance of Madhabi Mukherjee in this film. She is a beautiful deep, wonderful actress who simply surpasses all ordinary standards of judgment.\"\n This film was soon followed by her portrayals of Charu in Charulata (The Lonely Wife), the 1964 film based on Rabindranath Tagore's novella Nashtanir (The Broken Nest, 1901). Mukherjee's stunning portrayal of Charulata, a bored and neglected housewife of Calcutta in the 19th century, is a towering performance in the history of Indian cinema.\n Mukherjee reached the peak of her career with this film, possibly Ray's greatest film as well[citation needed], the Apu trilogy notwithstanding. As the bored and neglected housewife in Victorian Calcutta of the 1870s who gets attracted to her husband's cousin Amal (Soumitra Chatterjee), Mukherjee makes the central role of Charu her own. To date, Mukherjee in Charulata remains the benchmark for what an ideal Tagore heroine should be; it is said that when Ray returned to Tagore with Ghare Baire (1984) (The Home and the World), he stylised Swatilekha Chatterjee in a manner similar to Madhabi in Charulata[citation needed].\n Mukherjee's third and last film with Ray was Kapurush (The Coward) in 1965. The film looks at Amitabha Roy (Soumitra Chatterjee), a screenwriter whose car breaks down in a small town. He lodges with a local resident, Bimal Gupta (Haradhan Bannerjee). Bimal is married to Karuna (Mukherjee), who was a former girlfriend of Amitabha, a fact of which Bimal is unaware.\n Though she remained a big star in the Bengali commercial film industry, after Kapurush, Mukherjee failed to reach such critical heights as her films with Ritwik Ghatak and Satyajit Ray again.\n Her major films after Kapurush include Calcutta 71 in 1972 by Mrinal Sen, Biraj Bou in 1972 by Manu Sen, Strir Patra in 1972 by Purnendu Patri, Ganadevata  in 1978 by Tarun Majumdar, Bancharamer Bagan in 1980 by Tapan Sinha, Chokh in 1982, Chhandaneer in 1989 by Utpalendu Chakrabarty and Utsab in 2000 by Rituparno Ghosh.\n Mukherjee is married to Bengali film actor Nirmal Kumar.[4] They have two daughters, but are currently separated.\n She wrote her autobiography Ami Madhabi in 1995.[4][5]\n ", "tags": ["1943 births", "Living people", "Actresses from Kolkata", "Indian film actresses", "Actresses in Bengali cinema", "Kalakar Awards winners", "Best Actress National Film Award winners", "20th-century Indian actresses", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "EngvarB from August 2014", "Use dmy dates from June 2019", "BLP articles lacking sources from February 2013", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from June 2019", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Indian actress\n\n\nThis biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.
