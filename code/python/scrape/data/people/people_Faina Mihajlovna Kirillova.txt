SKirillova received her master's degree from the Ural State University in 1954 and her PhD from Moscow State University in 1961.[2] She was the first woman mathematician in Belarus to receive the Doctor of Science degree from the Saint Petersburg State University in 1968. From 1954 to 1962 she was an assistant senior researcher, and from 1962 to 1967 a senior researcher at the Ural State Technical University. From 1968 to 1969 she held the position of senior researcher, from 1970 to 2008 she was the head of the laboratory (later Department) of the theory of control processes of the Institute of Mathematics, National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. At the same time since 1996, she was chair of the working group of IFAC on optimal control. Since 1994, Kirillova was the founder and leader of the Belarusian Administration and Management Association.[3][1]\n She became Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in 1967, Professor in 1972.

Awarded Honoured Worker of Education of Vietnam (SRV) in 2001, and Honoured Scientist of the Republic of Belarus in 2002.[1]\n Kirillova has made extensive technical contributions in optimal control theory and optimization. She was an early proponent of using functional analysis to solve linear optimal problems. She developed important conditions for the controllability and observability of linear control systems with delay.[2] She provided a justification for the universal form of necessary optimality conditions for complex control systems based on variational derivatives. She discovered and justified (together with R. Gabasov) the quasi-maximum principle for discrete-time control systems and pioneered its application. She also developed a new numerical approach to solving linear programming problems, and she created numerical methods for the solution of linear, quadratic, nonlinear programming, and optimal control problems.[2] She developed a constructive theory of extreme problems, which provide effective access to the procedures for constructing computing solutions for a wide range of management and optimization problems; since the early 1980s it has been used in the solution applied control and optimization problems.[1]\n Kirillova has authored over 350 scientific papers, and 14 monographs. \nHer major works include:\n ", "tags": ["1931 births", "Women systems scientists", "Living people", "Control theorists", "Systems scientists", "Belarusian scientists", "Moscow State University alumni", "Belarusian State University faculty", "Belarusian mathematicians", "Women mathematicians", "Ural State University alumni", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Soviet mathematician\nFaina Mihajlovna Kirillova\u0424\u0430\u0456\u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0456\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u0430\u045e\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0456\u0440\u044b\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430Born (1931-09-29) 29 September 1931 (age\u00a089)Zuyevka, Kirov OblastAlma\u00a0materUral State UniversityMoscow State UniversitySaint Petersburg State UniversityAwardsUSSR Commission of the Council of Ministers Prize (1981)USSR Council of Ministers Prize (1986)Member, National Academy of Sciences of Belarus (1996)Ministry of Vietnam Award of Education (2001)Merited Scientist of Belarus (2002)Scientific careerFieldsOptimal controlInstitutionsBelarusian State UniversityNational Academy of Sciences of BelarusDoctoral advisorN.N.
