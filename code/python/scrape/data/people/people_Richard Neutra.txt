{"name": "Richard Neutra", "content": "Richard Joseph Neutra (April 8, 1892 \u2013 April 16, 1970) was a Jewish Austrian-American architect. Living and building for the majority of his career in Southern California, he came to be considered among the most prominent and important modernist architects.\n Neutra was born in Leopoldstadt, the 2nd district of Vienna, Austria Hungary, on April 8, 1892, into a wealthy Jewish family. His Jewish-Hungarian father Samuel Neutra (1844\u20131920)[1][2] was a proprietor of a metal foundry, and his mother, Elizabeth \"Betty\" Glaser[3] Neutra (1851\u20131905) was a member of the IKG Wien. Richard had two brothers who also emigrated to the United States, and a sister, Josephine Theresia \"Pepi\" Weixlg\u00e4rtner, an artist who was married to the Austrian art historian Arpad Weixlg\u00e4rtner and who emigrated later to Sweden, where her work can be seen at The Museum of Modern Art.\n Neutra attended the Sophiengymnasium in Vienna until 1910. He studied under Max Fabiani and Karl Mayreder at the Vienna University of Technology (1910\u201318), and also attended the private architecture school of Adolf Loos. In 1912 he undertook a study trip to Italy and the Balkans with Ernst Ludwig Freud (son of Sigmund Freud).[citation needed]\n In June 1914, Neutra's studies were interrupted when he was ordered to Trebinje; he served as a lieutenant in the artillery in Trebinje until the end of the war. Dione Neutra recalled her husband Richard\u2019s hatred of the retribution against the Serbs in an interview conducted in 1978 after his death: \u201cHe talked about the people he met [i.e. in Trebinje] \u2026 how his commander was a sadist, who was able to play out his sadistic tendencies \u2026 . He was just a small town clerk in Vienna, but then he became his commander.\u201d[4]\n Neutra took a leave in 1917 to return to the Technische Hochschule to take his final examinations.[5]\n After World War I, Neutra went to Switzerland where he worked with the landscape architect Gustav Ammann. In 1921 he served briefly as city architect in the German town of Luckenwalde, and later in the same year he joined the office of Erich Mendelsohn in Berlin. Neutra contributed to the firm's competition entry for a new commercial centre for Haifa, Palestine (1922), and to the Zehlendorf housing project in Berlin (1923).[6] He married Dione Niedermann, the daughter of an architect, in 1922. They had three sons, Frank L (1924\u20132008), Dion (1926\u20132019) an architect and his father's partner, and Raymond Richard (1939\u2013) a physician and environmental epidemiologist.\n Neutra moved to the United States by 1923 and became a naturalized citizen in 1929. Neutra worked briefly for Frank Lloyd Wright before accepting an invitation from his close friend and university companion Rudolf Schindler to work and live communally in Schindler's Kings Road House in California. Neutra\u2019s first work in Los Angeles was in landscape architecture, where he provided the design for the garden of Schindler\u2019s beach house (1922\u201325), designed for Philip Lovell, Newport Beach, and for a pergola and wading pool for Wright and Schindler\u2019s complex for Aline Barnsdall on Olive Hill (1925), Hollywood. Schindler and Neutra collaborated on an entry for the League of Nations Competition of 1926\u201327; in the same year they formed a firm with the planner Carol Aronovici (1881\u20131957) called the Architectural Group for Industry and Commerce (AGIC). He subsequently developed his own practice and went on to design numerous buildings embodying the International Style, twelve of which are designated as Historic Cultural Monuments (HCM), including the Lovell Health House (HCM #123; 1929) and the Richard and\nDion Neutra VDL Research House (HCM #640; 1966).[6] In California, he became celebrated for rigorously geometric but airy structures that symbolized a West Coast variation on the mid-century modern residence. Clients included Edgar J. Kaufmann, Galka Scheyer, and Walter Conrad Arensberg. In the early 1930s, Neutra's Los Angeles practice trained several young architects who went on to independent success, including Gregory Ain, Harwell Hamilton Harris, and Raphael Soriano. In 1932, he tried to move to the Soviet Union, to help design workers' housing that could be easily constructed, as a means of helping with the housing shortage.[7]\n In 1932, Neutra was included in the seminal MoMA exhibition on modern architecture, curated by Philip Johnson and Henry-Russell Hitchcock. In 1949 Neutra formed a partnership with Robert E. Alexander that lasted until 1958, which finally gave him the opportunity to design larger commercial and institutional buildings. In 1955, the United States Department of State commissioned Neutra to design a new embassy in Karachi. Neutra's appointment was part of an ambitious program of architectural commissions to renowned architects, which included embassies by Walter Gropius in Athens, Edward Durrell Stone in New Delhi, Marcel Breuer in The Hague, Josep Lluis Sert in Baghdad, and Eero Saarinen in London. In 1965 Neutra formed a partnership with his son Dion Neutra.[6] Between 1960 and 1970, Neutra created eight villas in Europe, four in Switzerland, three in Germany, and one in France. Prominent clients in this period included Gerd Bucerius, publisher of Die Zeit, as well as figures from commerce and science. His work was also part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.[8]\n Richard Joseph Neutra died on April 16, 1970, at the age of 78.[9]\n He was known for the attention he gave to defining the real needs of his clients, regardless of the size of the project, in contrast to other architects eager to impose their artistic vision on a client. Neutra sometimes used detailed questionnaires to discover his client's needs, much to their surprise. His domestic architecture was a blend of art, landscape, and practical comfort.[citation needed]\n In a 1947 article for the Los Angeles Times, \"The Changing House,\" Neutra emphasizes the \"ready-for-anything\" plan \u2013 stressing an open, multifunctional plan for living spaces that are flexible, adaptable and easily modified for any type of life or event. [10]\n Neutra had a sharp sense of irony. In his autobiography, Life and Shape, he included a playful anecdote about an anonymous movie producer-client who electrified the moat around the house that Neutra designed for him and had his Persian butler fish out the bodies in the morning and dispose of them in a specially designed incinerator. This was a much-embellished account of an actual client, Josef von Sternberg, who indeed had a moated house but not an electrified one.[citation needed]\n The novelist/philosopher Ayn Rand was the second owner of the Von Sternberg House in the San Fernando Valley (now destroyed). A photo of Neutra and Rand at the home was taken by Julius Shulman.[citation needed]\n Neutra's early watercolors and drawings, most of them of places he traveled (particularly his trips to the Balkans in WWI) and portrait sketches, showed influence from artists such as Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele etc. Neutra's sister Josefine, who could draw, is cited as developing Neutra's inclination towards drawing.[citation needed]\n Neutra's son Dion has kept the Silver Lake offices designed and built by his father open as \"Richard and Dion Neutra Architecture\" in Los Angeles. The Neutra Office Building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[11]\n In 1980, Neutra's widow donated the Van der Leeuw House (VDL Research House), then valued at $207,500, to California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona) to be used by the university's College of Environmental Design faculty and students.[12][13] In 2011, the Neutra-designed Kronish House (1954) at 9439 Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills sold for $12.8 million.[14]\n In 2009, the exhibition \"Richard Neutra, Architect: Sketches and Drawings\" at the Los Angeles Central Library featured a selection of Neutra's travel sketches, figure drawings and building renderings. An exhibition on the architect's work in Europe between 1960 and 1979 was mounted by the MARTa Herford, Germany.[citation needed]\n The Kaufmann Desert House was restored by Marmol Radziner + Associates in the mid-1990s.[15]\n The typeface family Neutraface, designed by Christian Schwartz for House Industries, was based on Richard Neutra's architecture and design principles.[citation needed]\n In 1977, he was posthumously awarded the AIA Gold Medal, and in 2015 he was honored with a Golden Palm Star on the Walk of Stars in Palm Springs, California.[16]\n Neutra's 1960 Fine Arts Building at California State University, Northridge was demolished in 1997, three years after suffering severe damage in the 1994 Northridge earthquake.[17] [18]\n The 1962 Maslon House in Rancho Mirage, California, was demolished in 2002.[19]\n Neutra's Cyclorama Building at Gettysburg was demolished by the National Park Service between March 8\u20139, 2013.[20]\n Cyclorama Building, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania\n Jardinette Apartments, Hollywood\n Kaufmann Desert House, Palm Springs, California.\n Garden Grove Community Church, Garden Grove, CA\n The former US embassy (later consulate) in Karachi, Pakistan\n \n Publications on Richard Neutra:\n Harriet Roth; Richard Neutra in Berlin, Die Geschichte der Zehlendorfer H\u00e4user, Berlin 2016.
