{"name": "Henri Cartan", "content": "Henri Paul Cartan (French:\u00a0[ka\u0281t\u0251\u0303]; 8 July 1904 \u2013 13 August 2008)[1] was a French mathematician who made substantial contributions to algebraic topology. He was the son of the French mathematician \u00c9lie Cartan[2] and the brother of composer Jean Cartan.\n Cartan studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Hoche in Versailles, then at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, receiving his doctorate in mathematics. He taught at the University of Strasbourg from November 1931 until the outbreak of the Second World War, after which he held academic positions at a number of other French universities, spending the bulk of his working life in Paris.\n Cartan is known for work in algebraic topology, in particular on cohomology operations, the method of \"killing homotopy groups\", and group cohomology. His seminar in Paris in the years after 1945 covered ground on several complex variables, sheaf theory, spectral sequences and homological algebra, in a way that deeply influenced Jean-Pierre Serre, Armand Borel, Alexander Grothendieck and Frank Adams, amongst others of the leading lights of the younger generation. The number of his official students was small, but includes Jos\u00e9phine Guidy Wandja (the first African woman to gain a PhD in mathematics), Adrien Douady, Roger Godement, Max Karoubi, Jean-Louis Koszul, Jean-Pierre Serre and Ren\u00e9 Thom.[3]\n Cartan also was a founding member of the Bourbaki group and one of its most active participants. His book with Samuel Eilenberg Homological Algebra [4] was an important text, treating the subject with a moderate level of abstraction with the help of category theory.\n Cartan used his influence to help obtain the release of some dissident mathematicians, including Leonid Plyushch and Jose Luis Massera. For his humanitarian efforts, he received the Pagels Award from the New York Academy of Sciences.[5]\n The Cartan model in algebra is named after Cartan.\n Cartan died on 13 August 2008 at the age of 104. His funeral took place the following Wednesday on 20 August in Die, Drome.[2]\n Cartan received numerous honours and awards including the Wolf Prize in 1980. He was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in 1932 in Z\u00fcrich and a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts[6] and in 1958 in Edinburgh.[7] From 1974 until his death he had been a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He was a foreign member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters,  Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, Royal Society of London, Russian Academy of Sciences, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, United States National Academy of Sciences, Polish Academy of Sciences and other academies and societies.\n ", "tags": ["Complex analysts", "Mathematical analysts", "Nicolas Bourbaki", "University of Strasbourg faculty", "Wolf Prize in Mathematics laureates", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Lille University of Science and Technology faculty", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Foreign Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences", "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni", "French centenarians", "1904 births", "2008 deaths", "Members of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters", "Members of the Polish Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters", "20th-century French mathematicians", "21st-century French mathematicians", "Lyc\u00e9e Hoche alumni", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with French-language sources (fr)", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "French mathematician\nHenri CartanHenri Cartan in 1968BornHenri Paul Cartan(1904-07-08)8 July 1904Nancy, FranceDied13 August 2008(2008-08-13) (aged\u00a0104)Paris, FranceNationalityFrenchAlma\u00a0mater\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieureKnown\u00a0forCartan's theorems A and BAlgebraic topologySeveral complex variablesHomological algebraAwardsWolf Prize (1980)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of ParisDoctoral advisorPaul MontelDoctoral studentsJean-Paul Benz\u00e9criPierre CartierJean CerfJacques DenyAdrien DouadyPierre DolbeaultRoger GodementMax KaroubiJean-Louis KoszulJean-Pierre SerreRen\u00e9 Thom\n\nHenri Paul Cartan (French:\u00a0[ka\u0281t\u0251\u0303]; 8 July 1904 \u2013 13 August 2008)[1] was a French mathematician who made substantial contributions to algebraic topology.
