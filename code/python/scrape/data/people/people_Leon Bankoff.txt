{"name": "Leon Bankoff", "content": "Leon Bankoff (December 13, 1908 \u2013 February 16, 1997), born in New York City, New York, was an American dentist. As an amateur mathematician he constructed the Bankoff circle. He was also an Esperantist.\n After a visit to the City College of New York, Bankoff studied dentistry at New York University. Later, he moved to Los Angeles, California, where he taught at the University of Southern California; while there, he completed his studies. He practiced over 60 years as a dentist in Beverly Hills. Many of his patients were celebrities.[1]\n Along with Bankoff's interest in dentistry were the piano and the guitar. He was fluent in Esperanto, created artistic sculptures, and was interested in the progressive development of computer technology. Above all, he was a specialist in the mathematical world and highly respected as an expert in the field of flat geometry. Since the 1940s, he lectured and published many articles as a co-author. Bankoff collaborated with Paul Erd\u0151s in a mathematics paper and therefore has an Erd\u0151s number 1.[2][3]\n From 1968 to 1981, Bankoff was the editor of the Problem Department of Pi Mu Epsilon Journals, where he was responsible for the publication of some 300 top problems in the area of plane geometry, particularly Morley's trisector theorem, and the arbelos of Archimedes.[1] Among his discoveries with the arbelos was the Bankoff circle, which is equal in area to Archimedes' twin circles.[4]\n ", "tags": ["20th-century American mathematicians", "Geometers", "American Esperantists", "1908 births", "1997 deaths", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "American mathematician\nLeon Bankoff (December 13, 1908 \u2013 February 16, 1997), born in New York City, New York, was an American dentist.
