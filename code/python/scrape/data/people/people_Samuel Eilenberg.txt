{"name": "Samuel Eilenberg", "content": "Samuel Eilenberg (September 30, 1913 \u2013 January 30, 1998) was a Polish-American mathematician who co-founded category theory (with Saunders Mac Lane) and Homological Algebra.\n He was born in Warsaw, Kingdom of Poland to a Jewish family. He spent much of his career as a professor at Columbia University.\n He earned his Ph.D. from University of Warsaw in 1936, where his thesis advisor was Karol Borsuk. He died in New York City in January 1998.\n Eilenberg's main body of work was in algebraic topology. He worked on the axiomatic treatment of homology theory with Norman Steenrod (whose names the Eilenberg\u2013Steenrod axioms bear), and on homological algebra with Saunders Mac Lane. In the process, Eilenberg and Mac Lane created category theory.\n Eilenberg was a member of Bourbaki and, with Henri Cartan, wrote the 1956 book Homological Algebra.[1]\n Later in life he worked mainly in pure category theory, being one of the founders of the field. The Eilenberg swindle (or telescope) is a construction applying the telescoping cancellation idea to projective modules.\n Eilenberg contributed to automata theory and algebraic automata theory. In particular, he introduced a model of computation called X-machine and a new prime decomposition algorithm for finite state machines in the vein of Krohn\u2013Rhodes theory.\n Eilenberg was also a prominent collector of Asian art. His collection mainly consisted of small sculptures and other artifacts from India, Indonesia, Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Central Asia. In 1991\u20131992, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York staged an exhibition from more than 400 items that Eilenberg had donated to the museum, entitled The Lotus Transcendent: Indian and Southeast Asian Art From the Samuel Eilenberg Collection.[2] In reciprocity, the Metropolitan Museum of Art donated substantially to the endowment of the Samuel Eilenberg Visiting Professorship in Mathematics at Columbia University.[3]\n ", "tags": ["1913 births", "1998 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Category theorists", "Columbia University faculty", "Nicolas Bourbaki", "Scientists from New York City", "Scientists from Warsaw", "People from Warsaw Governorate", "Polish emigrants to the United States", "Polish Jews", "Polish mathematicians", "Topologists", "University of Warsaw alumni", "Wolf Prize in Mathematics laureates", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Mathematicians from New York (state)", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Samuel EilenbergSamuel Eilenberg (1970)Born(1913-09-30)September 30, 1913Warsaw, Congress Poland, Russian EmpireDiedJanuary 30, 1998(1998-01-30) (aged\u00a084)New York City, United StatesCitizenshipRussian, Polish, AmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of WarsawKnown\u00a0forEilenberg\u2013Steenrod axiomsEilenberg swindleAwardsWolf Prize (1986)Leroy P.
