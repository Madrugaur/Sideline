{"name": "Paul Lorenzen", "content": "Paul Lorenzen (March 24, 1915 \u2013 October 1, 1994) was a German philosopher and mathematician, founder of the Erlangen School (with Wilhelm Kamlah) and inventor of game semantics (with Kuno Lorenz).\n Lorenzen studied at the University of G\u00f6ttingen until he earned his PhD there in 1938 under Helmut Hasse with a thesis titled Zur Abstrakten Begr\u00fcndung der multiplikativen Idealtheorie. In 1939, he became an assistant to Wolfgang Krull at the University of Bonn. His main work was on the foundations of mathematics\u2014proof theory. He created and modified constructive mathematics. Lorenzen taught at Stanford, the University of Texas, and Boston University in the USA. He was John Locke Lecturer\n in 1967/1968.\n Lorenzen came in 1962 to University of Erlangen (South Germany) and founded the Erlangen School of epistemological constructivism there.\n He wrote with Wilhelm Kamlah the famous book Logical Propaedeutic (\"Logische Prop\u00e4deutik\") and worked on game semantics (Dialogische Logik) with Kuno Lorenz. With Peter Janich he invented protophysics of time and space. He developed constructive logic, constructive type theory and constructive analysis.\n Lorenzen's work on calculus Differential and Integral was dedicated to Hermann Weyl. Lorenzen used Weyl's technique to develop a predicative analysis, which can reconstruct classical analysis, without the principle of excluded middle or the Axiom of Choice. He worked also on Gerhard Gentzen's cut elimination to find a way to continue Hilbert's program after the results of G\u00f6del.\n In the theory of geometry and physics, Lorenzen was influenced by Hugo Dingler. He followed Dingler in building up geometry and physics out of primitive operations. Lorenzen took an early interpretation of Steven Weinberg (Gravitation and Cosmology, 1972) for his doubts about geometrical elements of general relativity, believing that Maxwell's equations are to be modified by general relativity instate.\n Lorenzen was also influenced by Wilhelm Dilthey's hermeneutics, and liked to quote Dilthey's saying that knowledge cannot go behind life. Dilthey's Lebensphilosophie was the description of the setting in ordinary experience in which we construct the abstractions of mathematics and physics.\n As John Locke Lecturer he invented normative Logic as a base on ethics and political argumentation.\n ", "tags": ["1915 births", "1994 deaths", "20th-century German mathematicians", "20th-century German philosophers", "Continental philosophers", "German logicians", "Proof theorists", "Philosophers of language", "University of Bonn alumni", "German male writers", "Relativity critics", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician and philosopher\nPaul LorenzenBornMarch 24, 1915Kiel, German EmpireDiedOctober 1, 1994\u00a0(1994-11) (aged\u00a079)G\u00f6ttingen, GermanyScientific careerFieldsPhilosophy, mathematicsDoctoral advisorHelmut HasseInfluencesAristotle \u00b7 KantInfluencedHoppe\n\nPaul Lorenzen (March 24, 1915 \u2013 October 1, 1994) was a German philosopher and mathematician, founder of the Erlangen School (with Wilhelm Kamlah) and inventor of game semantics (with Kuno Lorenz).\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Theory\n3 Major works\n4 Bibliography\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nLorenzen studied at the University of G\u00f6ttingen until he earned his PhD there in 1938 under Helmut Hasse with a thesis titled Zur Abstrakten Begr\u00fcndung der multiplikativen Idealtheorie.
