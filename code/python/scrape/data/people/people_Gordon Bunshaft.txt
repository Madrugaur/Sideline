{"name": "Gordon Bunshaft", "content": "Gordon Bunshaft, FAIA (May 9, 1909 \u2013 August 6, 1990), was an American architect, a leading proponent of modern design in the mid-twentieth century. A partner in the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), Bunshaft joined in 1937 and remained for more than 40 years. The long list of his notable buildings includes Lever House in New York, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., the National Commercial Bank in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 140 Broadway (Marine Midland Grace Trust Co.) and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Branch Bank in New York; the last was the first post-war \"transparent\" bank on the East Coast.[1]\n Bunshaft was born in Buffalo, New York, to Russian Jewish immigrant parents,[2] and attended Lafayette High School.  He received both his undergraduate (1933) and his master's (1935) degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studied in Europe on a Rotch Traveling Scholarship from 1935 to 1937.\n After his traveling scholarship, Bunshaft worked briefly for Edward Durell Stone and industrial designer Raymond Loewy before joining SOM.  Bunshaft's early influences included Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier.[3]\n In the 1950s, Bunshaft was hired by the State Department's Office of Foreign Building Operations as a collaborator on the design for several U.S. consulates in Germany.[4][5]\n Bunshaft's only single-family residence was the 2300 square foot (210 m\u00b2) Travertine House, built for his own family. On his death he left the house to MoMA, which sold it to Martha Stewart in 1995.[6]  Her extensive remodelling stalled amid an acrimonious planning dispute with a neighbour. In 2005, she sold the house to textile magnate Donald Maharam, who described the house as \"decrepit and largely beyond repair\" and demolished it.[7][8][9]\n Bunshaft was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters and was the recipient of numerous other honors and awards.  He received the Brunner Prize of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1955, and its gold medal in 1984.  He also received the American Institute of Architects Twenty-five Year Award for Lever House, in 1980, and the Pritzker Architecture Prize, in 1988. In 1958, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1959.  From 1963 to 1972, he was a member of the Commission of Fine Arts in Washington.[1]\n Upon receiving the Pritzker Prize in 1988,[10] for which he nominated himself,[11] he gave the shortest speech of any winner in the award's history, stating:\n In 1928, I entered the MIT School of Architecture and started my architectural trip. Today, 60 years later, I've been given the Pritzker Architecture Prize for which I thank the Pritzker family and the distinguished members of the selection committee for honoring me with this prestigious award.
