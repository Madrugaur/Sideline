{"name": "Gustaf Dal\u00e9n", "content": "Nils Gustaf Dal\u00e9n (Swedish pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8\u0261\u0275\u0302s\u02d0tav da\u02c8le\u02d0n] (listen); 30 November 1869 \u2013 9 December 1937) was a Swedish Nobel Laureate and industrialist, engineer, inventor and long-term CEO of the AGA company and inventor of the AGA cooker and the Dal\u00e9n light. In 1912 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his \"invention of automatic regulators for use in conjunction with gas accumulators for illuminating lighthouses and buoys\".\n Dal\u00e9n was born in Stenstorp, a small village in Falk\u00f6ping Municipality, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County.[1] He managed the family farm, which he expanded to include a market garden, a seed merchants and a dairy. In 1892 he invented a milk-fat tester to check milk quality of the milk delivered and went to Stockholm to show his new invention for Gustaf de Laval. de Laval was impressed by the self-taught Dal\u00e9n and the invention and encouraged him to get a basic technical education. He was admitted to the Chalmers University of Technology where he earned his Master's degree and a Doctorate on leaving in 1896. Dal\u00e9n was much the same type of inventor as Gustaf de Laval, not afraid of testing \"impossible\" ideas, but Dal\u00e9n was much more careful with the company economy. The products should have a solid market place before he introduced a new product.\n In 1906 Dal\u00e9n became chief engineer at the Gas Accumulator Company (manufacturer and distributor of acetylene) and in 1909 when AGA was founded, he was appointed the managing director for the company. During his life, AGA was one of the most innovative companies in Sweden and produced a large variety of products that grew every year. Finally in the early 1970s AGA was forced to reduce the number of markets it was involved in and concentrate on the production of gases for industrial use.\n In 1909 he ascended to the position of Managing Director of the renamed company Svenska Aktiebolaget Gasaccumulator (AGA). AGA developed lighthouses using Dal\u00e9n's products. In 1910 the company bought a large real estate in Liding\u00f6 and built a production plant that was completed around 1912, when they moved out from the facilities in Stockholm.\n Initially Dal\u00e9n worked with acetylene (IUPAC: ethyne), a flammable and sometimes  explosive hydrocarbon gas. Dal\u00e9n invented Agamassan (Aga), a substrate used to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation.\n Acetylene produced an ultra-bright white light which superseded the less bright LPG as the fuel of choice for lighthouse illumination.\n Dal\u00e9n exploited the new fuel, developing the Dal\u00e9n light which incorporated another invention, the sun valve. This device allowed the light to operate only at night, conserving fuel, and extending their service life to over a year.\n The 'Dalen Flasher' was a device that, except for a small pilot light, only consumed gas during the flash stage. This reduced gas consumption by more than 90%. The AGA lighthouse equipment worked without any type of electric supply and was thus extremely reliable.\n To a rugged coastal area like Scandinavia, his mass-produced, robust, minimal maintenance buoys were a significant boon to safety and livelihood. AGA Lighthouses covered the entire Panama Canal.\n In 1922 he patented his invention of the AGA cooker. Most of the testing for the cooker was made in his private kitchen in his Villa Ekbacken that was built when AGA moved to Liding\u00f6 in 1912 but that he never actually had a chance to see with his own eyes. His family helped him with the development work, checking temperatures, airflow etc., as the development work proceeded.\n His parents were Anders and Lovisa Dal\u00e9n. He married Elma Persson in 1901. They had four children, two daughters and two sons:\n Early in 1912, Dal\u00e9n was blinded in an acetylene explosion during a test of maximum pressure for the accumulators. Later the same year he was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics for his work on lighthouse technology. Too ill to attend the presentation, Dal\u00e9n had his brother, ophthalmologist Professor Albin Dal\u00e9n of the Caroline Institute, stand in his place.\n The presentation speech praised the quality of sacrificing personal safety in scientific experimentation, a compliment that compared Dal\u00e9n with Nobel himself. Despite his blindness, Dal\u00e9n controlled AGA until his death in 1937. He received over 100 patents during his lifetime.\n The AGA production and development center around 1920.\n Some of the remaining AGA-buildings, today working as a center for small companies.

When the lighthouse was electrified in 1980 it was determined that the sun valve had been working continuously since 1912 without the need for an overhaul.\nInitially Dal\u00e9n worked with acetylene (IUPAC: ethyne), a flammable and sometimes  explosive hydrocarbon gas. Dal\u00e9n invented Agamassan (Aga), a substrate used to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation.\nAcetylene produced an ultra-bright white light which superseded the less bright LPG as the fuel of choice for lighthouse illumination.\nDal\u00e9n exploited the new fuel, developing the Dal\u00e9n light which incorporated another invention, the sun valve.
