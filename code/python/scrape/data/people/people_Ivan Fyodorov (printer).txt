{"name": "Ivan Fyodorov (printer)", "content": "Ivan Fyodorov (Russian: \u0418\u0432\u0430\u0301\u043d \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, sometimes transliterated as Fedorov[1] or Fiodorov; c. 1525 in Grand Duchy of Moscow \u2013 December 16, 1583 in Lw\u00f3w, Ruthenian Voivodeship, Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth) was one of the fathers of Eastern Slavonic printing (along with Schweipolt Fiol and Francysk Skaryna), he was the first known Russian printer in Moscow and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, he was also a skilled cannon maker and the inventor of a multibarreled mortar.\n In those times Russians still did not have hereditary surnames, but used patronymics or nicknames, which were also not stable. In his first book \"Apostolos\" (printed in Moscow in 1564) he called himself in typical Russian style Ivan Fedorov that is \"Ivan, son of Fedor\".[2] In his other famous book \"Ostrog Bible\" (1581) he called himself in both Church Slavonic and Greek as \"Ivan, son of Fe\u043edor (\u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u044b\u043d, \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03ce\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c5\u1f31\u03cc\u03c2), a printer from Moscow\". In the Greek version there was \"from Great Russia\" instead of \"from Moscow\". But when he was living for a long time in Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, he adopted a local Ruthenian style patronymic in Polish-language spelling \"Fedorowicz\" and also added a nickname indicating his origin. In his Latin documents he signed Johannes Theodori Moscus (that is \"a Muscovite\"[3]), or Ioannes Fedorowicz Moschus, typographus Gr\u00e6cus et Sclavonicus. As a result of the dialectical replacement of consonant /f/ with /x~xw/ in early East Slavic the first letter F was sometimes changed, so the patronymic became Chwedorowicz or Chodorowicz. In his later Slavonic books (printed in PLC) he signed \"Ioann (Ivan) Fe(o)dorovich\" (with some orthographic differences), and added a nickname \"a Muscovite printer\" or just simply \"a Muscovite\".[1]\n Neither his place nor his date of birth are known. It is assumed that he was born circa 1510, most likely, in Moscow: he called himself a Muscovite even after his move to Lithuania, and in his afterword to the Lviv Apostle he named Moscow \"our home, our fatherland and our kin\".[4] In 1935 a Russian historian of heraldry, Lukomsky, advanced the hypothesis that his printer's mark resembled the Szreniawa coat of arms of the Rahoza szlachta family, and that Fyodorov had a connection with that family either by descent or by adoption.[5] No subsequent researchers have accepted that theory other than Nemirovsky (2002), who agreed only with the possibility of adoption but not with the theory of Fyodorov's descent from the szlachta.[6]\n Fyodorov graduated from Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, Poland in 1532 with a bachelor's degree.\n In 1564\u20135 Fedorov accepted an appointment as a deacon in the church of Saint Nicolas (Gostunsky) in the Moscow Kremlin.  Together with Pyotr Timofeev from Mstislavl, i.e. Mstislavets he established the Moscow Print Yard and published a number of liturgical works in Church Slavonic using moveable type. This technical innovation created competition for the Muscovite scribes, who began to persecute Fyodorov and Mstislavets, finally forcing them to flee to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania after their printing workshop had been burned down (an alleged arson, as related by Giles Fletcher in 1591).[7]\n The printers were received by the Great Lithuanian Hetman Hrehory Chodkiewicz at his estate in Zab\u0142ud\u00f3w (northern Podlaskie), where they published Yevangeliye uchitel\u2019noye (Didactic Gospel, 1569) (see Zab\u0142ud\u00f3w Gospel) and Psaltir\u2019 (Psalter, 1570).\n He moved to Lviv in 1572 and resumed his work as a printer the following year at the Saint Onuphrius Monastery. (Fyodorov's tombstone in Lviv is inscribed with \"renewed neglected printing\".) In 1574 Fyodorov, with the help of his son and Hryn Ivanovych of Zab\u0142ud\u00f3w published the second edition of the Apostolos (previously published by him in Moscow), with an autobiographical epilogue, and an Azbuka (Alphabet book).\n In 1575 Fyodorov, now in the service of Prince Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski, was placed in charge of the Derman Monastery near Dubno; in 1577\u20139 he established the Ostrog Press, where, in 1581, he published the Ostrog Bible in Church Slavonic - the first full version of the Bible printed in moveable type, as well as a number of other books. Fyodorov returned to Lviv after a quarrel with Prince Konstantyn Ostrogski, but his attempt to reopen his printing shop was unsuccessful. His printing facilities became the property of the Lviv Dormition Brotherhood (later the Stauropegion Institute). The brotherhood used Fyodorov's original designs until the early 19th century.\n In 1583 he visited Vienna and Krak\u00f3w, where he showed the Emperor his latest inventions.\nHe then returned to Lviv, where he died on December 16, 1583; he was buried there on the grounds of the Saint Onuphrius Monastery.\n 1.
