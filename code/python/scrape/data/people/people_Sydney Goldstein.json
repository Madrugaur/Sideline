{"name": "Sydney Goldstein", "content": "Sydney Goldstein FRS[1] (3 December 1903, Kingston upon Hull \u2013 22 January 1989, Cambridge, MA) was a British mathematician noted for his contribution to fluid dynamics.[2][3] He is described as: \"... one of those who most influenced progress in fluid dynamics during the 20th century.\"[1]\n He was especially known for his work on steady-flow laminar boundary-layer equations and  on the turbulent resistance to rotation of a disk in a fluid. Goldstein was extremely knowledgeable on aerodynamics and his work had a significant impact in that area.[2]\n Goldstein went to school at Bede Collegiate School in Sunderland[4] and went on to the University of Leeds in 1921 where he studied mathematics but was to move to St John's College, Cambridge, graduating from the Mathematical Tripos in 1925 and gaining the Smith's Prize in 1927. He was awarded an Isaac Newton Studentship to continue research in applied mathematics under Harold Jeffreys. His 1928 PhD thesis was entitled The Theory And Application Of Mathieu Functions.[3]\n He was appointed Rockefeller Research Fellow and spent a year working in University of G\u00f6ttingen.[2] In 1929 he became a  fellow of St John's College but later the same year was appointed to a lectureship in Mathematics at the University of Manchester. At Manchester the influence of Osborne Reynolds and Horace Lamb in fluid dynamics was still felt there and had a strong effect on Goldstein.[2] Moving to Cambridge in 1931 he took over the editorship of Modern Developments in Fluid Dynamics on Lamb's death.\n During World War II Goldstein worked on boundary layer theory at the National Physical Laboratory and at the end of the war he was appointed to the Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics in Manchester.\n Goldstein strongly supported the State of Israel and in 1950 he accepted the chairmanship of the department of mathematics at Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology. having made a major contribution to the establishment of the Technion he found the administrative load too heavy[2] and moved again, accepting the chair of  Gordon McKay Professor of Applied Mathematics at Harvard University in 1954.[4] He retired in 1968 but continued as an emeritus professor at Harvard.\n ", "tags": ["1903 births", "1989 deaths", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Mathematicians from Kingston upon Hull", "English Jews", "Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge", "Academics of the Victoria University of Manchester", "Harvard University faculty", "Fluid dynamicists", "People educated at Bede Grammar School for Boys", "20th-century mathematicians", "Scientists of the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)", "British expatriate academics", "CS1: long volume value", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Sydney GoldsteinBorn(1903-12-03)3 December 1903Kingston upon Hull, United KingdomDied22 January 1989(1989-01-22) (aged\u00a085)Alma\u00a0materUniversity of LeedsCambridge UniversityKnown\u00a0forTaylor-Goldstein equationScientific careerFieldsFluid dynamicsInstitutionsUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenUniversity of ManchesterCambridge UniversityThesisThe Theory And Application Of Mathieu Functions\u00a0(1928)Doctoral advisorHarold JeffreysDoctoral studentsLeslie Howarth\n\nSydney Goldstein FRS[1] (3 December 1903, Kingston upon Hull \u2013 22 January 1989, Cambridge, MA) was a British mathematician noted for his contribution to fluid dynamics.[2][3] He is described as: \"... one of those who most influenced progress in fluid dynamics during the 20th century.\"[1]\nHe was especially known for his work on steady-flow laminar boundary-layer equations and  on the turbulent resistance to rotation of a disk in a fluid.
