{"name": "Hans Hendrik van Paesschen", "content": "\n Hans Hendrik van Paesschen (c. 1510-1582) was a Flemish architect, based in Antwerp, who designed high-style classical buildings in many countries of northern Europe.[1]\n While Italy was blessed with the architecture of Andrea Palladio and France with that of Philibert Delorme, a contemporary of theirs, Hans Hendrik van Paesschen, was designing equally beautiful buildings in northern Europe. One of the reasons he is so little known is that in each country where he worked his name was spelled differently.[2]\n After presumably receiving his training in Italy, Paesschen established himself in Antwerp as architect and builder, often using the sculptor Cornelis Floris de Vriendt to secure architectural commissions for him. Paesschen worked in Flanders, the Netherlands, England, Wales, north Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and K\u00f6nigsberg. It is also likely that he designed buildings in northeastern France, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, but these have so far not been identified.\n In sharp contrast to the gothic and mannerist styles being used at the time in northern Europe, Paesschen often designed buildings in a pure Florentine style, but with a northern flavor. He employed arcaded and colonnaded loggias, domes, and Venetian arches on his best buildings.  The majority of his buildings have been destroyed or substantially altered, so his work is known mostly through old pictures. Several generations of his descendants in the Van de Passe family were notable engravers, usually with the surname de Pas or van de Passe.[citation needed]\n ", "tags": ["1510s births", "1582 deaths", "Flemish architects", "Renaissance architects", "Articles needing additional references from October 2018", "All articles needing additional references", "Use dmy dates from October 2020", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from July 2015", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers"], "raw": "This article needs additional citations for verification.
