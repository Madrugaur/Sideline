In July\u2013August 1936, Nikolai Luzin was criticised in Pravda in a series of anonymous articles, whose authorship later was attributed to Kolman.[4] Luzin was accused of publishing his works in foreign scientific journals and denounced for being close to the  \u201cslightly modernized ideology of the black hundreds, orthodoxy, and monarchy.\u201d\n After World War II Kolman was sent to Czechoslovakia, where he worked as a head of the propaganda department of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Central Committee.

He was summoned back to USSR and spent three years at the Lubianka prison, until Stalin's death.\n He returned to Czechoslovakia in 1958\u20131963, and then lived in Moscow, where he became increasingly disaffected with Soviet communism.\n Kolman authored several books on dialectical materialism and historical materialism.\n In 1976 he applied for political asylum in Sweden, making him the oldest asylum seeker from the Soviet Union at the time at 84.[6] He terminated his 58-year membership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on September 22, 1976, in an open letter addressed to party general secretary Leonid Brezhnev.
