{"name": "Arnold Walfisz", "content": "Arnold Walfisz (2 July 1892 \u2013 29 May 1962) was a Jewish-Polish[1] mathematician working in analytic number theory.\n After the Abitur in Warsaw (Poland), Arnold Walfisz studied (1909\u221214 and 1918\u221221) in Germany at Munich, Berlin, Heidelberg and G\u00f6ttingen. Edmund Landau was his doctoral-thesis supervisor at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Walfisz lived in Wiesbaden from 1922 through 1927, then he returned to Warsaw, worked at an insurance company and at the mathematical institute of the university (habilitation in 1930). In 1935, together with Salomon Lubelski\u00a0[pl], he founded the mathematical journal Acta Arithmetica.
