{"name": "John Bennet Lawes", "content": "\n Sir John Bennet Lawes, 1st Baronet, FRS (28 December 1814 \u2013 31 August 1900) was an English entrepreneur and agricultural scientist.[1] He founded an experimental farm at his home at Rothamsted Manor that eventually became Rothamsted Research, where he developed a superphosphate that would mark the beginnings of the chemical fertilizer industry.[citation needed]\n John Bennet Lawes was born at Rothamsted in modern-day Harpenden near St Albans, Hertfordshire, on 28 December 1814,[2] the only son of John Bennet Lawes,[3] owner of the Rothamsted estate and lord of the manor of Rothamsted.[citation needed] His father died when he was eight years old, so he was raised mostly by his mother Marianne.[2] He was educated at Eton College and at Brasenose College, Oxford, although he didn't graduate.[citation needed] Even before leaving Oxford in 1832, Lawes had begun to interest himself in growing various medicinal plants on the Rothamsted estates, which he inherited from his father upon his death in 1822. Around 1837, he began to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots, and a year or two later the experiments were extended to crops in the field in order to free farmers from relying on animals to produce fertilizer.[citation needed] In 1839, an ostrich belonging to him escaped Rothamsted and caused a bit of property damage, although the only person it hurt was the first one to try and capture it.[4] In 1842, he patented a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulphuric acid, and thus initiated the artificial manure industry.[1] In the succeeding year he enlisted the services of Joseph Henry Gilbert, with whom he experimented for more than half a century in raising crops and feeding animals,[1] activities which have rendered Rothamsted famous to scientific agriculturists.[5] In 1854, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, which in 1867 bestowed a Royal Medal on Lawes and Gilbert jointly,[citation needed] and in 1882 he was awarded the title of baronet.[6] He died in 1900, passing his manor to his son Charles,[6] and is buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas Church, Harpenden with his wife Caroline (n\u00e9e Fountaine) Lawes (1822-1895).\n In 1889, Lawes took measures to ensure the continued existence of the Rothamsted experimental farm by setting aside money solely for that purpose and constituting the Lawes Agricultural Trust.[1] Rothamsted Experimental Station is the oldest agricultural research facility in the world.[2]\n In Harpenden, Sir John Lawes School is named after him.[5]\n The locality of Lawes, Queensland, in Australia is named after him. The main feature of that locality is the University of Queensland Gatton Campus which specialises in agriculture.[7]\n ", "tags": ["1814 births", "1900 deaths", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Royal Medal winners", "English agronomists", "People from Harpenden", "English businesspeople", "Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford", "Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom", "People educated at Eton College", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Use dmy dates from June 2014", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from May 2018", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For other people named John Lawes, see John Lawes (disambiguation).\n\n\nSir John Bennet Lawes, BtBorn28 December 1814Harpenden near St Albans, HertfordshireDied31 August 1900 (aged 85)AwardsAlbert Medal (1893)\n Lawes as caricatured by Spy (Leslie Ward) in Vanity Fair, July 1882\nSir John Bennet Lawes, 1st Baronet, FRS (28 December 1814 \u2013 31 August 1900) was an English entrepreneur and agricultural scientist.[1] He founded an experimental farm at his home at Rothamsted Manor that eventually became Rothamsted Research, where he developed a superphosphate that would mark the beginnings of the chemical fertilizer industry.[citation needed]\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Legacy\n3 References\n4 Further reading\n5 External links\n\n\nLife[edit]\nJohn Bennet Lawes was born at Rothamsted in modern-day Harpenden near St Albans, Hertfordshire, on 28 December 1814,[2] the only son of John Bennet Lawes,[3] owner of the Rothamsted estate and lord of the manor of Rothamsted.[citation needed] His father died when he was eight years old, so he was raised mostly by his mother Marianne.[2] He was educated at Eton College and at Brasenose College, Oxford, although he didn't graduate.[citation needed] Even before leaving Oxford in 1832, Lawes had begun to interest himself in growing various medicinal plants on the Rothamsted estates, which he inherited from his father upon his death in 1822.
