{"name": "Raima Sen", "content": "\n Raima Sen (born Raima Dev Varma on 7 November 1979)[1] is an Indian actress who is known for her work in Bengali and Hindi Film industry.\n Raima Sen was born on 7 November 1979 in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) to Moon Moon Sen and Bharat Dev Barma and the granddaughter of actress Suchitra Sen who is regarded as the \"Mahanayika\" of Bengali Cinema. Her sister Riya Sen is also in the Bollywood industry.[1] Their father Bharat Dev Varma is a member of the royal family of Tripura.[citation needed] Her paternal grandmother, Ila Devi, was the princess of Cooch Behar, whose younger sister Gayatri Devi was the Maharani of Jaipur.[citation needed] Her paternal great-grandmother Indira was the only daughter of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda.[2][3]\n Raima's maternal great-grandfather Adinath Sen was a prominent Kolkata businessman, whose son Dinanath Sen \u2013 a relative of former Union Law Minister Ashoke Kumar Sen- was the Diwan or a Minister of the Maharaja of Tripura.[4] The sisters are credited on-screen under their mother's maiden name, although their official papers carry the surname Dev Varma.[5]\n Sen made her debut in the film Godmother, which was a critically acclaimed[by whom?] success, but her minor role may have been overlooked in favour of the protagonist, played by Shabana Azmi. She then starred in the film Daman playing Raveena Tandon's daughter, where her small performance was appreciated.\n Her breakthrough role came when she starred in the Rituparno Ghosh's film Chokher Bali. After a few more average movies she had a critically acclaimed[by whom?] hit in 2005 with Parineeta, where she played the playmate of the film's heroine, played by the debutante Vidya Balan. Since then she has had two more hits with the action thriller Dus and the Bengali film Antar Mahal (where she had a very small role). In 2006, she appeared in the film The Bong Connection (co-starring Shayan Munshi). In 2007, she worked in the thriller Manorama Six Feet Under with Abhay Deol. In 2011, she starred in the hit Bengali film Baishe Srabon, opposite Parambrata Chatterjee.\n 2014 saw Sen as the leading lady in the critically acclaimed Hrid Majharey, the first Bengali movie based on the works of William Shakespeare, and presented as a tribute on the 450th year of birth of the Bard.[6][7] She co-stars with Abir Chatterjee and Indrasish Roy in this dark love-story by debutant filmmaker Ranjan Ghosh.[8] The film has earned a rare recommendation from the very prestigious Film London in its list of world cinema based on the plays of Shakespeare.[9] The film and its screenplay have also been included in the prestigious UGC Literature Archive.[10] It is also famous for being the only other Bengali film after Sabuj Dweeper Raja (1979) to be shot in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.[11][12][13]\n In 2016, she was seen in Bollywood Diaries, a film written and directed by K.D. Satyam. The film also stars Ashish Vidyarthi and Salim Diwan.[14] Amazon Prime The Last Hour [15] Web Series will release in 2020 Ending in this series Raima Sen and sanjay kapoor playing the main role this series directed by Amit Kumar.\n Sen is said to resemble her grandmother much more than either her mother or her sister.[16] In an interview, she says while she enjoys Mumbai's faster pace of life, its gyms and its nightclubs, she misses her family in Kolkata, her dog Cuddles, and Kolkata's street food, notably Jhal Muri and Aloo chaat.[17]\n ", "tags": ["Indian film actresses", "1979 births", "Living people", "Actresses in Bengali cinema", "Tripuri people", "Bengali people", "Actresses in Hindi cinema", "University of Calcutta alumni", "21st-century Indian actresses", "Actresses in Telugu cinema", "Actresses in Malayalam cinema", "Actresses from Tripura", "Actresses in Tamil cinema", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from January 2021", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Use Indian English from December 2014", "All Wikipedia articles written in Indian English", "Use dmy dates from June 2018", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from June 2020", "Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from March 2014", "All articles lacking reliable references", "Articles lacking reliable references from March 2019", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Indian actress\nNot to be confused with Reema Sen, Rii Sen, Rimi Sen, Riya Sen, or Reema.\n\n\nRaima SenRaima Sen at HM store launch in Kolkata on 2017.BornRaima Dev Varma (1979-11-07) 7 November 1979 (age\u00a041)Mumbai, Maharashtra, IndiaOccupationActressYears\u00a0active1999\u2013presentParent(s)Moon Moon Sen (mother)Bharat Dev Varma (father)RelativesRiya Sen (sister)Suchitra Sen (grandmother)\nRaima Sen (born Raima Dev Varma on 7 November 1979)[1] is an Indian actress who is known for her work in Bengali and Hindi Film industry.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Personal life\n4 Filmography\n\n4.1 Films\n4.2 Web Series\n\n\n5 Awards\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nRaima Sen was born on 7 November 1979 in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) to Moon Moon Sen and Bharat Dev Barma and the granddaughter of actress Suchitra Sen who is regarded as the \"Mahanayika\" of Bengali Cinema.
