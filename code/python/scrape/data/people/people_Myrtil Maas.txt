He studied at the \u00c9cole normale until the political upheaval of 1815 caused the suspension of the school. In that year, when walking with some of his schoolfellows in the Champ de Mars, where the troops were drilling, he was accidentally shot in the leg, and the wound never perfectly healed.[2]\n Being a Jew, he was unable to obtain a chair in mathematics; but he found employment first in a porcelain factory and then as a private tutor. In 1818 he was employed as actuary by the newly-formed Compagnie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des assurances sur la vie et contre l'incendie, a Paris insurance company. He joined Olinde Rodrigues to form an committee to watch over and control the operations of the company, and the principles they established for insurance tariffs were soon adopted by all the leading French life insurance companies.[3] Together, they produced the actuarial tables that would be used by all French insurance companies throughout the century, which were eventually published in 1860 and had seven editions until 1933.[4][5]\n Maas laboured actively in the interests of the Jews, and played a leading role in the Consistoire central isra\u00e9lite in the 1830s and 1840s, serving as its vice-president from 1843.[6] He died on 27 February 1865 from a malady that developed from his wound.[2]\n \u00a0This article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Singer, Isidore; Dunbar, Newell (1901\u20131906). \"Maas, Myrtil\".
