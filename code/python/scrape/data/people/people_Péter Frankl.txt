{"name": "P\u00e9ter Frankl", "content": "\n P\u00e9ter Frankl (born 26 March 1953 in Kaposv\u00e1r, Somogy County, Hungary) is a mathematician, street performer, columnist and educator, active in Japan.[4] Frankl studied Mathematics at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest and submitted his PhD thesis while still an undergraduate. He holds PhD degree  from  University Paris Diderot as well.  He has lived in Japan since 1988, where he is a well-known personality and often appears in the media. He keeps travelling around Japan performing  (juggling and giving public lectures on various topics).  Frankl won a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad in 1971. He has seven joint papers with Paul Erd\u0151s,[5] and eleven joint papers with Ronald Graham.[6] His research is in combinatorics, especially in extremal combinatorics. He is the author of the union-closed sets conjecture.[7]\n Both of his parents were survivors of concentration camps and taught him \"The only things  you own are in your heart and brain\". So he became a mathematician. Frankl often lectures about racial discrimination.[8]\n He could multiply two digit numbers when he was four years old.[9] Frankl speaks 12 languages (Hungarian, English, Russian, Swedish, French, Spanish, Polish, German, Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Korean) and lectured mathematics in many countries in these languages. He has travelled to more than 100 countries.[10][11]\n Frankl learnt juggling from Ronald Graham. He and R\u00f6dl solved a $1000 problem of Paul Erd\u0151s.
