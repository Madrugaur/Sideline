{"name": "Peter Calthorpe", "content": "Peter Calthorpe (born 1949) is a San Francisco-based architect, urban designer and urban planner. He is a founding member of the Congress for New Urbanism, a Chicago-based advocacy group formed in 1992 that promotes sustainable building practices. For his works on redefining the models of urban and suburban growth in America Calthorpe has been named one of twenty-five \u2018innovators on the cutting edge\u2019 by Newsweek magazine.[1]\n Calthorpe was born in London and raised in Palo Alto, California.[2] He attended the Yale School of Architecture.\n In the 1986 he, along with Sim Van der Ryn, published Sustainable Communities.[3]  In the early 1990s he developed the concept of Transit Oriented Development (TOD) highlighted in The Next American Metropolis: Ecology, Community, and the American Dream.[4]\n He has taught at U.C. Berkeley, the University of Washington, the University of Oregon, and the University of North Carolina.[citation needed]\n In 1989, he proposed the concept of Pedestrian Pocket, an up to 110 acres (45\u00a0ha) pedestrian-friendly, transit-linked, mixed-use urban area with a park at its centre. The Pedestrian Pocket mixes low-rise high-density housing, commercial and retail uses. The concept had a number of similarities with Ebenezer Howard's Garden City and aimed to be an alternative to the then usual low-density residential suburban developments.[5]\n As an expert on urban planning, Peter Calthorpe, is frequently cited in various reputable mass media including New York Times,[6] The Guardian,[7] National Geographic,[8] Newsweek,[9] Grist,[10] Metropolismag,[11] The Advocate[12] and others.\n In 2006 Calthorpe won the ULI J.C. Nichols Prize for Visionaries in Urban Development.[13]\n In his 2017 TED Talk Calthorpe addressed the necessity of efficient use of space and resources in the context of climate change and identified urban sprawl an urgent trend that requires immediate attention.[14]\n In 2018 Calthorpe launched urban-planning software UrbanFootprint that should help fight sprawl allowing non-experts to model the impacts of different urban planning scenarios.[15]\n Among most recent Calthorpe\u2019s concerns are autonomous cars as potential reason for increased urban congestion and suburban sprawl. Unlike the advocates of self-driving cars who believe that they will lead to fewer cars and faster commutes, Calthorpe believes that the convenience of autonomous transport will only encourage more car trips.[16] He suggests alternative plan to avoid congestion \u2013 autonomous rapid transit \u2013 fleets of self-driving vans in reserved lanes on main arteries.[17]\n He is married to Jean Driscoll.[18] He has three children: Lucia, Jacob, and Asa.[18]\n His sister Diana Calthorpe is married to real estate developer Jonathan F. P. Rose.[19] His niece is artist Rachel Rose.\n ", "tags": ["20th-century American architects", "American urban planners", "New Urbanism", "Antioch College alumni", "Yale School of Architecture alumni", "Living people", "Urban designers", "1949 births", "21st-century American architects", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from August 2013", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Peter CalthorpeCalthorpe in 2011Born1949 (age\u00a071\u201372)NationalityUnited StatesEducationB.A. Antioch College,\nYale School of ArchitectureSpouse(s)Jean DriscollChildren3FamilyDiana Calthorpe (sister) Jonathan F.
