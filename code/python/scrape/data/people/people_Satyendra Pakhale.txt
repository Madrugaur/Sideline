{"name": "Satyendra Pakhale", "content": "\n Satyendra Pakhal\u00e9 (also known as Satyen Pakhal\u00e9; born 1967)[2] is an industrial designer, designer and architect.[3][4] He realizes projects from industrial design, applied research to product design, development and manufacturing. He works in the fields of product design, including consumer electronics, transportation, home appliances, furniture, digital products & computers, and architecture & interior design. In 2008, he was selected as one of L\u2019Uomo Vogue magazine\u2019s 80 most influential creative people with vision worldwide in design and architecture. His works are in permanent collections of several museums worldwide.\n Satyen Pakhal\u00e9 was born and raised in central Maharashtra, India.[citation needed] He graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Design Engineering from Visvesvaraya Regional College of Engineering, Nagpur (now Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology). He then studied for a Master's degree in Design at the Industrial Design Centre, Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, and Product Design at the Art Center College of Design, Switzerland, Europe.[citation needed]\n Pakhal\u00e9 has been internationally active in the field of industrial design and architecture since 1993.\n He worked initially at Philips Design\u2014new business creation department on innovative products in the areas of digital communication and transportation. In 1998 he set up his own design practice in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n One of his solo industrial design exhibitions of his works took place in the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, and another at Otto Gallery Bologna, Italy, curated by Paola Antonelli, curator of Museum of Modern Art,[5] New York and at Gallery Ammann,[6] Cologne, Germany.\n The design manager and marketing executive Alceo Serafini has described Pakhal\u00e9's work as follows:[citation needed]\n \"The refreshing difference to be found in Satyendra Pakhal\u00e9's designs lies indeed in the form he chooses, for his way of creating is not merely subjective, rather it is the sublimation of cultures in which he belongs. The resulting design language is beautiful to look at, stimulating and easy to interpret. In this way he gives to us a new identity, that belonging to all the people of the world.\" In 2014, Pakhal\u00e9 is selected as one of ten Must-See Artists-Designers[7] at Miami Art Week 2014 for \u2018Design at Fairchild \u2013 Satyendra Pakhale\u2019[8] exhibition at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, Coral Gables, Miami, Florida, USA.\n \u2018Culture of Creation\u2019 is an active studio practice, an ongoing research platform cofounded by Satyendra Pakhal\u00e9 together with   Arch. Dr. Tiziana Proietti in 2013, based on decades of studio practice coupled with theoretical applied research. Culture is always dynamic, always evolving and changing at any time in history. The notion of a \u2018Culture of Creation\u2019 refers to the primal and innate impulse behind human making. The \u2018Culture of Creation\u2019 platform brings critical thinking and studio practice together while covering topics such as social modernity and secular humanism, atmospheres of spaces and objects, human senses and perception, poetic analogy of form and sensorial design. \u2018Culture of Creation\u2019   explores the inner dimension of objects and spaces. From the start Satyendra Pakhal\u00e9 has cultivated a design practice focused on the culture of making, be it craftsmanship or highly technological manufacturing, inspired by tireless research on the mentioned topics. This theoretical position\u2013\u2018Culture of Creation\u2019 \u2013 was first published in a comprehensive monograph called / \u2018Satyendra Pakhal\u00e9 Culture of Creation\u2019 by nai010 Publisher, Netherlands Architecture Institute, Rotterdam, NL.\n At the heart of Satyendra Pakhal\u00e9\u2019s studio practice as a \u2018Culture of Creation\u2019 are two key considerations. The first, his conviction that cultural influences without succumbing to nostalgia, false narratives or traditionalism, have to be factored in. The second is his perception of the rational, the emotional and the multi-sensorial as being one. By reflecting upon and then synthesizing these two aspects, he has developed a concept of \u2018social modernity\u2019 rooted in social cohesion that is at the same time contemporary and forward-looking. In Satyendra Pakhal\u00e9\u2019s view the project of \u2018modernity\u2019 is still a work in progress in most societies, to achieve diverse, equitable and inclusive social cohesion. Design has to help bring the disintegrating elements together, unite them and then weave them into a flourishing contemporary society. We ought to rebuild society on the foundations of \u2018social modernity\u2019. In Pakhal\u00e9\u2019s view, \u2018Design is a cultural act about justice as much as utility and beauty.\u2019\n Please see Satyendra Pakhal\u00e9 Associates, Amsterdam, the Netherlands\n Pakhal\u00e9 has received the following awards and recognition:[citation needed]\n Pakhal\u00e9 work in the following permanent collections:\n Pakhal\u00e9 has been regularly invited to give lectures and workshops in USA, Europe and Asia at universities and conferences.[citation needed] He was visiting faculty at the department of Man and Activity from 1999\u20132006.
