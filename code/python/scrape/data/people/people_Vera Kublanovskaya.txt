{"name": "Vera Kublanovskaya", "content": "Vera Nikolaevna Kublanovskaya (n\u00e9e Totubalina; November 21, 1920 \u2013 February 21, 2012 [1]) was a Russian mathematician noted for her work on developing computational methods for solving spectral problems of algebra. She proposed the QR algorithm for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors in 1961, which has been named as one of the ten most important algorithms of the twentieth century.[2] This algorithm was proposed independently by the English computer scientist John G.F. Francis in 1959.\n Dr Vera Kublanovskaya was born in November 1920 in Krokhona, a village near Belozersk in Vologda Oblast, Russia. She was born in a farming and fishing family as one of nine siblings. She passed away at the age of 91 years old on February 2012. [3]\n Dr. Vera Kublanovskaya started her tertiary education in 1939 at the Gertzen Pedagogical Institute in Leningrad.[4] There, she was encouraged to pursue a career in mathematics. She moved on to study mathematics at Leningrad State University in 1945 and graduated in 1948. Following her graduation, she joined the Leningrad Branch of the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences. She remained there for 64 years of her life. \n In 1955, she got a first doctorate degree on the application of analytic continuation to numeric methods.
