{"name": "Jean Taylor", "content": "Jean Ellen Taylor[1] (born 1944)[2] is an American mathematician who is a professor emerita at Rutgers University[3] and visiting faculty at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University.[4]\n Taylor was born in Northern California.[5] She did her undergraduate studies at Mount Holyoke College, graduating summa cum laude with an A.B. in 1966.[5] She began her graduate studies in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, but after receiving an M.Sc. she switched to mathematics under the mentorship of S. S. Chern and then transferred to the University of Warwick and received a second M.Sc. in mathematics there. She completed a doctorate in 1973 from Princeton University under the supervision of Frederick J. Almgren, Jr..[5][1]\n Taylor joined the Rutgers faculty in 1973, and retired in 2002.[5] She was president of the Association for Women in Mathematics from 1999 to 2001.[5][6]\n She has been married three times, to mathematicians John Guckenheimer and Fred Almgren, and to financier and science advocate William T. Golden.[5][7]\n Taylor is known for her work on the mathematics of soap bubbles and of the growth of crystals. In 1976 she published the first proof of Plateau's laws, a description of the shapes formed by soap bubble clusters that had been formulated without proof in the 19th century by Joseph Plateau.[8]\n Taylor is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Association for Women in Mathematics, the American Mathematical Society[9] and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.[10] In 2001, she received an honorary doctorate from Mount Holyoke.[5] In 2017, she was selected as a fellow of the Association for Women in Mathematics in the inaugural class.[11]\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "20th-century American mathematicians", "1944 births", "Women mathematicians", "Mount Holyoke College alumni", "University of California, Berkeley alumni", "Alumni of the University of Warwick", "Princeton University alumni", "Rutgers University faculty", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences faculty", "Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics", "Fellows of the Association for Women in Mathematics", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nFor other people named Jean Taylor, see Jean Taylor (disambiguation).\nJean TaylorProfessor Jean Ellen Taylor in 2019BornJean Ellen Taylor1944\u00a0(1944)Northern CaliforniaNationalityUnited StatesAlma\u00a0materUniversity of California, Berkeley, University of Warwick, Princeton UniversitySpouse(s)John Guckenheimer, Frederick J.
