{"name": "Kristin Lauter", "content": "Kristin Estella Lauter (born 1969)[1] is an American mathematician and cryptographer whose research interest is broadly in application of number theory and algebraic geometry in cryptography. She is particularly known for her work in the area of elliptic curve cryptography. She is currently a researcher and the head of the Cryptography Group at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Washington, which developed Microsoft SEAL.[2]  Lauter became the President-Elect of the Association for Women in Mathematics in February 2014[3] and served as President February 1, 2015 - January 31, 2017.\n Lauter received her Bachelor of Arts, Master of Science, and Ph.D, all in mathematics, from the University of Chicago, in 1990, 1991, and 1996, respectively.\n Prior to joining Microsoft, she held positions as a visiting scholar at Max Planck Institut fur Mathematik in Bonn, Germany (1997), T.H. Hildebrandt research assistant professor at the University of Michigan (1996-1999), and a visiting researcher at Institut de Mathematiques Luminy in France (1999).[4][5]\n In 1999, Lauter joined Microsoft to work on her research in cryptography.[6]  She has worked on developing new cryptographic systems, research on post quantum systems, and researching to find faults in current cryptographic systems.\n In 2005, she worked with coworkers at Microsoft to develop a cryptographic algorithm from supersingular isogeny graphs.  She created a HASH function from it and presented it at  NIST HASH function competition.[6]\n Dr. Kristin Lauter is also known for her work in homomorphic encryption, which has been commonly used in machine-learning, building mathematical models, private AI, and the collection of genomic data.[6]  She has also worked on encryption with the Cloud. Not only does she learn about encryption, but she also taught tutorials as well. A specific tutorial on homomorphic encryption allowed her to meet some iDASH organizers who she explained her encryption techniques, such as edit distance and chi-squared statistics.[7]\n She is a co-founder of the Women in Numbers Network,[8] a research collaboration community for women in number theory.  The first conference was held in 2008 and it was called the WIN Conference.  Groups of number theorists work on research and have published about 50 papers.[9]  She serves on the Advisory Board[10] of the Banff International Research Station and on the Council[11] of the American Mathematical Society. She served as president of the Association for Women in Mathematics 2015\u20132017.[12]\n Lauter and her coauthors were awarded the Selfridge Prize at ANTS VIII for their paper Computing Hilbert Class Polynomials.[13]  She was elected to the 2015 Class of  Fellows of the American Mathematical Society \"for contributions to arithmetic geometry and cryptography as well as service to the community.\" [14]\n In 2017, she was selected as a fellow of the Association for Women in Mathematics in the inaugural class.[15]\n She was chosen as the Polya Lecturer for the Mathematical Association of America, lasting from 2018\u20132020.[16]\n In 2020 she was elected a fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics with the citation \"Kristin E.
