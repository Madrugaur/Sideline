{"name": "Wilhelm Vauck", "content": "\n Wilhelm Vauck (* 8 October 1896 in Neustadt, Dresden, \u2020 8 December 1968 in Bautzen) was a German mathematician,[1] physicist and university lecturer in physics and electrical engineering.[2] During World War II, Vauck was the director of the agents Referat within the Funkabwehr, the German Armies radio counter-intelligence organisation. As an anti-nazi, Vauck's work on the discovery of the Rote Kapelle anti-fascist resistance group during World War II, burdened him deeply until the end of his life.[2][3]\n After World War I finished, Vauck undertook study of mathematics and physics at the Technical University of Dresden. In 1922, he passed the exam for a higher education office, and two years later, under supervision of Gerhard Kowalewski, Vauck  was promoted to Dr. phil with a thesis titled A generalisation of Bolzano's continuous but non-differentiable function (German: Versuch einer Verallgemeinerung der stetigen nirgends differenzierbaren Funktion Bolzanos) which is within Mathematics Subject Classification 26 Real functions.\n Vauck's first career position was as a teacher at the secondary school in Thum  and then from 1926 as a teacher at the secondary school in Bautzen.[2] After the war  from 1948, he became a teacher in Bautzen and later became a lecturer in physics and electrical engineering at the engineering school in Bautzen.[2]\n During his military career, Vauck held the rank of Oberleutnant. In the spring of 1942, Vauck was ordered to report to In 7/VI to attend a cryptographic course (General der Nachrichtenaufkl\u00e4rung Training Referat). He proved to be a very able cryptographer and was selected to be Head of Unit (German: Referatsleiter) of Referat Agenten or Referat Agent in OKH/In 7/VI/12 or Referat 12 of In 7/VI. This referat had just been formed and had to be commanded by an officer so that its interests could be properly represented to other agencies. Vauck spent four weeks becoming familiar with the practical work of the unit.[4] The Referat would eventually be called Referat Vauck, due to its successes discovering anti-fascist organisations.[5]\n Vauck lead the team at Referat 12 that would eventually discover the German anti-fascist network that would later be called the Red Orchestra (German: Rote Kapelle) by the Abwehr.[6] Dr Vauck succeeded in decrypting around 200 messages of the Rote Kapelle.[7] The first discovery of the network was the discovery of the woman agent, Rita Arnould on 12\u201313 December 1941, which later led to the locating of radio operator Johann Wenzel, the second discovery.  On 15 July 1942, the discovery that lead to the full realisation of the size and complexity of Rote Kappelle was made, when a message was deciphered. On that date, Vauck successfully deciphered a message. It had the format:\n that was decoded into;\n KENT from Director Personal.

However Vauck answered the phone and when he requested the name of the caller to take a message, and was met with Schulze-Boysen, who was already identified as CORO, the deception was revealed, and Heilmann was arrested.[6]\n ", "tags": ["1896 births", "1958 deaths", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Use dmy dates from February 2018", "Use British English from February 2018", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing German-language text", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nWilhelm VauckPicture of Wilhelm Vauck while working with a Slide rule.BornJune 8, 1896\u00a0(1896-06-08)Neustadt, DresdenDiedDecember 8, 1968(1968-12-08) (aged\u00a072)BautzenCitizenshipGermanAlma\u00a0materTU DresdenScientific careerFieldsMathematicsPhysicsDoctoral advisorGerhard Hermann  Waldemar Kowalewski\n\nWilhelm Vauck (* 8 October 1896 in Neustadt, Dresden, \u2020 8 December 1968 in Bautzen) was a German mathematician,[1] physicist and university lecturer in physics and electrical engineering.[2] During World War II, Vauck was the director of the agents Referat within the Funkabwehr, the German Armies radio counter-intelligence organisation.
