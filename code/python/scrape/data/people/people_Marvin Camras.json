Shortly afterwards he discovered that using magnetic tape made the process of splicing and storing recordings easier.\n Camras's work attracted the notice of his professors at what is now Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and was offered a position at Armour Research Foundation (which merged with Lewis Institute in 1940 to become IIT) to develop his work.\n Before and during World War II Camras' early wire recorders were used by the armed forces to train pilots. They were also used for disinformation purposes: battle sounds were recorded and amplified and the recordings placed where the D-Day invasion was not going to take place. This work was kept secret until after the war.\n In June 1944 he was awarded U.S. Patent 2,351,004,[1] titled \"Method and Means of Magnetic Recording\".
