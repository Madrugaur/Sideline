Her discoveries in this area have included the construction of the first known movable configurations with four points per line and four lines through each point.[2] With another mathematician at the University of Alaska, Jill Faudree, she has developed methods for constructing highly symmetric configurations with as many as six points per line and six lines through each point.[3]\n Berman was born in 1976 in St. Louis.[4] She is the daughter of Harry J.
