{"name": "Andreas Brandst\u00e4dt", "content": "Andreas Brandst\u00e4dt (born 17 January 1949 in Arnstadt, East Germany) is a German mathematician and computer scientist.\n He graduated from the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany, with a Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat.) in stochastics in 1976 and a habilitation (Dr. sc. nat.) in complexity theory in 1983.\nSince 1974 he worked there in the group of his academic teacher Gerd Wechsung.\n From 1991 to 1994, he was the professor for Computer Science in the Department of Mathematics,\n[1] at the University of Duisburg, Germany,\nand from 1994 to 2014 he was the professor for Theoretical Computer Science[2] at the University of Rostock, Germany.\n He was a visiting professor at the universities of Metz, Amiens, and Clermont-Ferrand (France) and at the University of Primorska in Koper\n(Slovenia). He was Invited Speaker at various conferences in Argentina, Austria, Belarus, Brasil, Canada, China, France,\nGreece, India, Israel, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, and Switzerland.\n Brandst\u00e4dt is an active researcher in graph algorithms, discrete mathematics, combinatorial optimization, and graph theory. A frequently used tool in his papers is tree structure of graphs and hypergraphs such as for hypertrees, strongly chordal graphs and chordal graphs.\n He frequently took part in program committees such as Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science (and three times was a co-organizer of this\nconference) and is member of the Editorial Board of Discrete Applied Mathematics.[3]\n ", "tags": ["20th-century German mathematicians", "21st-century mathematicians", "Living people", "1949 births", "Theory of computation", "Graph theorists", "German computer scientists", "People from Arnstadt", "University of Jena alumni", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Andreas Brandst\u00e4dtBorn17 January 1949\u00a0(1949-01-17) (age\u00a072)Arnstadt, East GermanyNationalityGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of JenaKnown\u00a0forGraph Theory: hypertrees, strongly chordal graphsScientific careerFieldsMathematicianInstitutionsUniversity of Jena, University of Duisburg, University of RostockDoctoral advisorGerd Wechsung\n\nAndreas Brandst\u00e4dt (born 17 January 1949 in Arnstadt, East Germany) is a German mathematician and computer scientist.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and work\n2 Selected bibliography\n3 Notes\n4 External links\n\n\nLife and work[edit]\nHe graduated from the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany, with a Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat.) in stochastics in 1976 and a habilitation (Dr. sc. nat.) in complexity theory in 1983.\nSince 1974 he worked there in the group of his academic teacher Gerd Wechsung.\nFrom 1991 to 1994, he was the professor for Computer Science in the Department of Mathematics,\n[1] at the University of Duisburg, Germany,\nand from 1994 to 2014 he was the professor for Theoretical Computer Science[2] at the University of Rostock, Germany.\nHe was a visiting professor at the universities of Metz, Amiens, and Clermont-Ferrand (France) and at the University of Primorska in Koper\n(Slovenia).
