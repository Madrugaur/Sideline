{"name": "Jeanne LaDuke", "content": "Alice Jeanne LaDuke (born June 27, 1938) is an American  mathematician who specialized in mathematical analysis and the history of mathematics. She was also a child actress who appeared in one film (The Green Promise).\n LaDuke was raised on a farm in Posey County,[1] in southwest Indiana. Her parents were college-educated and an aunt who taught mathematics in Chicago frequently visited, bringing mathematics puzzles for LaDuke.[2]\n As a child, she was cast from a field of 12,000 4-H members to play a small part in The Green Promise (1948)[1] as farm girl Jessie Wexford, the sister of Natalie Wood's character's love interest.[3] Wood and LaDuke shared a tutor who taught them both string games as well as their school curriculum.[4]\n LaDuke studied mathematics at DePauw University in the 1950s, and roomed with another mathematics major from Oregon, who showed her the state on summer camping trips.[2]\n She earned a master's degree in mathematics, but was unable to obtain a teaching position with it because the schools she applied to only hired men.
