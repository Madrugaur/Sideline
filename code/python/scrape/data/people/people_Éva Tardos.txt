{"name": "\u00c9va Tardos", "content": "\u00c9va Tardos (born 1 October 1957) is a Hungarian mathematician and the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University.\n Tardos's research interest is algorithms. Her work focuses on the design and analysis of efficient methods for combinatorial optimization problems on graphs or networks. She has done some work on network flow algorithms like approximation algorithms for network flows, cut, and clustering problems. Her recent work focuses on algorithmic game theory and simple auctions.[1]\n Tardos received her Dipl. Math in 1981 and her Ph.D. 1984 from E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University under her advisor Andr\u00e1s Frank.[2] She was the Chair of the Department of Computer Science at Cornell from 2006-2010, and she is currently serving as the Associate Dean of the College of Computing and Information Science.[3]\n She was editor-in-Chief of SIAM Journal on Computing from 2004-2009, and is currently the Economics and Computation area editor of the Journal of the ACM as well as on the Board of Editors of Theory of Computing.[4]\n She has co-authored with Jon Kleinberg a textbook called Algorithm Design (ISBN\u00a01292037040).\n Tardos has been elected to the National Academy of Engineering (2007), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Academy of Sciences (2013)[5] and the American Philosophical Society (2020)[6]\nShe is also an ACM Fellow (since 1998), a Fellow of INFORMS,[7] and a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society (2013)[8]\nShe is the recipient of Packard, Sloan Foundation, and Guggenheim fellowships.[9]\n She is the winner of the Fulkerson Prize (1988),\nthe George B.
