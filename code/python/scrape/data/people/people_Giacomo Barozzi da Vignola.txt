His two great masterpieces are the Villa Farnese at Caprarola and the Jesuits' Church of the Ges\u00f9 in Rome. The three architects who spread the Italian Renaissance style throughout Western Europe are Vignola, Serlio and Palladio.\n Giacomo Barozzi was born at Vignola, near Modena (Emilia-Romagna).[3]\n He began his career as architect in Bologna, supporting himself by painting and making perspective templates for inlay craftsmen. \nHe made a first trip to Rome in 1536 to make measured drawings of Roman temples, with a thought to publish an illustrated Vitruvius. \nThen Fran\u00e7ois\u00a0I called him to Fontainebleau, where he spent the years 1541\u20131543.

Here Vignola was working with Ammanati, who designed the nymphaeum and other garden features under the general direction of Vasari, with guidance from the knowledgeable pope and Michelangelo. A medal of 1553 shows Vignola's main villa substantially as it was completed, save for a pair of cupolas.\nVilla Farnese at Caprarola (1559\u20131573);\nVilla Lante at Bagnaia (1566 onwards), including the gardens and their water features and casini;\nChiesa del Ges\u00f9, Rome, the mother church of the Jesuit order, which would become a source for Baroque church facades in the 17th century;\nBasilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli, Assisi (with Galeazzo Alessi);\nChurch of Sant'Andrea in Via Flaminia, Rome, the first church to have an oval dome, which became a signature of the Baroque.\nPalazzo dei Banchi, Bologna\nPalazzo Farnese, Piacenza. This was a grandiose project of a vast palace on a scale paralleled only by the Vatican Palace in Italy; the rectangular plan is circa 111 metres by 88 metres. The actual construction, however, made up only less than a half of Vignola's original project and lacked many of the planned architectural features; missing elements include part of the exterior surrounding walls, the main fa\u00e7ade, modelled on the ancient triumphal arch and with a large tower, and a theater in the large inner courtyard.\nOther Architectural Works[edit]\n Cloister of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum\nThe main courtyard of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum, formerly the convent of the Church of Santi Domenico e Sisto, is traditionally attributed to Vignola but completed after his death.  Ten arches on the long sides and seven on the short are sustained by pilasters with Tuscan style ornamentation that rise from high plinths.  A simple frieze with smooth triglyphs and metopes separates the lower from the upper levels.[4]\nUnbuilt Works[edit]\nLike many other architects, Vignola submitted his plans for completing the facade of San Petronio, Bologna. Designs by Vignola, in company with Baldassare Peruzzi, Giulio Romano, Andrea Palladio and others furnished material for an exhibition in 2001[5]\n\nWritten Works[edit]\n Le due regole della prospettiva prattica, 1682\nHis two published books helped formulate the canon of classical architectural style.
