{"name": "Robert Mills (architect)", "content": "Robert Mills (August 12, 1781 \u2013 March 3, 1855), a South Carolina architect known for designing both the first Washington Monument, located in Baltimore, Maryland, as well as the better known monument to the first president in the nation's capital, Washington, DC. He is sometimes said to be the first native-born American to be professionally trained as an architect.[by whom?] Charles Bulfinch of Boston perhaps has a clearer claim to this honor. \n Mills studied in Charleston, South Carolina, as a student in the lower school at the College of Charleston and of Irish architect James Hoban, and later worked with him on his commission for the White House. This became the official home of US presidents. Both Hoban and Mills were Freemasons. Mills also studied and worked with Benjamin Henry Latrobe of Philadelphia. He designed numerous buildings in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and South Carolina, where he was appointed as superintendent of public buildings. His Washington Monument in Washington, DC was not completed until 1885, 30 years after his death.\n Born in Charleston, South Carolina, to Ann (Taylor) and William Mills, Robert received private education as a child and later attended the lower school of the College of Charleston. He then studied with Irish architect James Hoban. Mills followed his mentor Hoban to Washington, DC, as he had gotten the commission for design and construction of the White House in the new capital.  During this time, Mills met Thomas Jefferson, who became the first full-term resident of the new presidential residence.   \n In 1802 Mills moved to Philadelphia, where he became an associate and student of Benjamin Henry Latrobe. Some Philadelphia buildings that Mills designed are Washington Hall, Samson Street Baptist Church, and the Octagon Church for the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia. He also designed the Upper Ferry Bridge covering.\n Mills designed the First Presbyterian Church in Augusta, Georgia in 1807, which was built between 1809 and 1812. In 1808 Mills created blueprints for a prison to be used mostly for reform of prisoners. In 1811 the prison was constructed in Mt. Holly, New Jersey. \"With the possible' exception of Eastern States Penitentiary in Philadelphia, it is considered \"the most significant prison building in the United States\", according to the Historic Burlington County Prison Museum Association. In 1812, Mills designed the Monumental Church in Richmond, Virginia. It was built to commemorate the deaths of 72 people in the Richmond Theatre fire.\n Moving to Baltimore, Maryland, Mills designed St. John's Episcopal Church, the Maryland House of Industry, the First Baptist Church of Baltimore (at South Sharp and West Lombard streets) in 1817, and a Greek Revival mansion at the northeast corner of West Franklin and Cathedral streets (across from the Old Baltimore Cathedral/Basilica of the Assumption of Mary). The mansion was later occupied from 1857 to 1892 by the Maryland Club, a dining and leisure society of Southern-leaning gentlemen. \n Mills is noted for designing the nation's first Washington Monument, located in Baltimore with four surrounding park squares. These were named Washington Place along the north-south axis of North Charles Street, and Mount Vernon Place along East and West Monument streets. This development took place in the new Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood. \n This land had formerly belonged been part of Howard's Woods, the country estate and mansion \"Belvedere\" of Col. John Eager Howard (1752-1827), north of old Baltimore Town. Howard was a Revolutionary War commander of the famed \"Maryland Line\" regiment of the Continental Army. Construction on Baltimore's signature landmark began in 1815 and was completed in 1829.\n In 1820, Mills was appointed as acting commissioner of the Board of Public Works in South Carolina. In 1823, he was the superintendent of public buildings. In the next few years, he designed numerous buildings in South Carolina, including court houses, the campus of the University of South Carolina, jails, and the Fireproof Building in Charleston. In 1825, he wrote an Atlas of the State of South Carolina.[1] One year later, he published Statistics of South Carolina.[2][3]\n He reputedly designed the Old Horry County Courthouse, Union County Jail, and Wilson House, which have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[4][5]\n In 1836 Robert Mills won the competition for the design of the Washington Monument on the future Mall of the National Capital, Washington D.C.  This is his best known work. Construction began in 1848, but was interrupted in 1854 and postponed by the outbreak of the American Civil War. Construction of the monument resumed in 1879 after the Reconstruction era. It was dedicated in 1885, thirty years after the architect's death.\n He also designed the Department of Treasury building, east of the Executive Mansion (White House), and several other federal buildings in Washington, D. C., including the U.S. Patent Office Building, patterned after the Parthenon. It has been renovated and adapted as two adjoining museums of the Smithsonian Institution: the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery).[6] He also designed the old General Post Office.[7]\n In South Carolina, Mills designed county courthouses in at least 18 counties, some of the public buildings in the capital Columbia, and a few private homes. He also designed portions of the Landsford Canal in Chester County, on the Catawba River in South Carolina.\n Mills was an early advocate of fireproof construction. When a fire broke out in the Kingstree, South Carolina Building, which he designed, the county records on the first floor were protected due to his fireproofing measures.  But a fire destroyed much of his Lancaster County, South Carolina Courthouse in August 2008.\n Mills died in Washington, D.C. in 1855. He was buried there at the Congressional Cemetery. Mills was inducted into the South Carolina Business Hall of Fame in 2007.\n The broadest context for Mills' architecture was neoclassical architecture. This was the dominant style of building that was winning architectural design competitions and major projects of the time, both in Europe and in the United States. Under the umbrella of neoclassicism, his designs were partly Palladian, Georgian, and often Greek Revival.\n Apart from stylistic movements in architecture going on in the world, Mills was involved in the more local context of building in the Mid-Atlantic States. There, and especially in Washington D.C., many figures were contributing architecture of high quality. To build as Mills did on what is now the National Mall, he had to contend with the strictures of the plan by Pierre Charles L'Enfant, as well as Andrew and Joseph Ellicott. He was likely also influenced by the powerful example of Thomas Jefferson and his Jeffersonian architecture. Mills created a distinctive federal style of architecture.\n ", "tags": ["1781 births", "1855 deaths", "19th-century American architects", "Architects from South Carolina", "Burials at the Congressional Cemetery", "Federalist architects", "Greek Revival architects", "Artists from Charleston, South Carolina", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from August 2013", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American architect\nFor other persons of the same name please, see Robert Mills (disambiguation).\nRobert MillsBorn(1781-08-12)August 12, 1781Charleston, South Carolina, USDiedMarch 3, 1855(1855-03-03) (aged\u00a073)Washington D.C., USNationalityAmericanEducationCollege of Charleston and James HobanOccupationArchitect, EngineerSpouse(s)Eliza Barnwell Smith\nRobert Mills (August 12, 1781 \u2013 March 3, 1855), a South Carolina architect known for designing both the first Washington Monument, located in Baltimore, Maryland, as well as the better known monument to the first president in the nation's capital, Washington, DC.
