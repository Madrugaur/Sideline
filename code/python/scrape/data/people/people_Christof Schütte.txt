He graduated in physics from Paderborn University in 1991, and then obtained his PhD in mathematics under the supervision of Peter Deuflhard in 1994. He is currently[when?] a Professor in Numerical Mathematics and Scientific Computing at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, and the president of the Zuse Institute Berlin.\n Sch\u00fctte has been one of the driving forces behind the Research Center \u201cMathematics for Key Technologies\u201d (MATHEON) former DFG Research Center Matheon[1] and has been its co-chair since 2008. Since 2015, he has acted as the head of the Research Campus MODAL, a public-private partnership between mathematics research institutes and 15 industrial companies, and as the co-chair of the Einstein Center for Mathematics in Berlin.\n Sch\u00fctte's research has focused on the multiscale modelling and simulation for complex systems, numerical mathematics, data-driven modelling and statistical learning with applications in the natural, materials and life sciences. He is co-inventor of the transfer operator approach[2] to metastability that has led to the development of widely used computational methods like Markov state models[3] in molecular dynamics or the (extended) dynamic mode decomposition.\n Sch\u00fctte has been an invited speaker at the International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM) in Zurich, 2007, and at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Hyderabad, 2010.[citation needed][4]\n Christof Sch\u00fctte has published more than 150 articles in scientific journals.[5]\n ", "tags": ["1966 births", "Living people", "Paderborn University alumni", "20th-century German mathematicians", "21st-century German mathematicians", "Applied mathematicians", "Free University of Berlin faculty", "CS1: long volume value", "Articles needing additional references from March 2018", "All articles needing additional references", "Wikipedia articles with style issues from April 2019", "All articles with style issues", "Wikipedia external links cleanup from April 2019", "Wikipedia spam cleanup from April 2019", "Articles with multiple maintenance issues", "All articles with vague or ambiguous time", "Vague or ambiguous time from April 2019", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from April 2019", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This article has multiple issues.
