The paper contained a passage that many readers considered homophobic and sexist.\n\n^ \"The Relativity and Universality of Logic\u00a0: Synthese de la Mayonnaise\". I do not know what Beziau's general opinions are. All I am speaking here about is the content of the paper in question (which I read as a logician, meaning that I read what is actually written - no more, no less). So I declare that I find the reaction on \"Feminist Philosophers\" 100 times more frightening than the paragraph in Beziau's paper it was about. It is a Stalinist reaction. No less. How can anyone who actually reads it in a rational way describe it as \"Homophobic and Sexist\"?\n\n^ \"Logica Universalis\". doi:10.1007/s11787-019-00221-5. S2CID\u00a085518839.
