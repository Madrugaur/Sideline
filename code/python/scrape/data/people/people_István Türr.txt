In the later years of his life became known as a peace activist.\n T\u00fcrr was born in the city of Baja, Hungary, the fifth child of an ironmonger. His mother was Ter\u00e9zia Udvary, whose father was a medical doctor. When young he was not a diligent pupil and left school early. As a teenager he tried his father's profession as well as working in a mill and as an unskilled mason, but did not show great aptitude for any of these three jobs.\n The first time he tried to enlist in the Austrian Army he was rejected, but on his re-application in 1842 he was accepted at the age of 17. Moreover, officers found in him a hitherto unnoticed promise and encouraged him to improve himself and undergo officer's training at P\u00e9cs. By 1848 he was already a military engineer at the rank of lieutenant in a Hungarian grenadier regiment.\n At the time when the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 engulfed his homeland, T\u00fcrr was stationed in Lombardy, Italy. He was involved in early fighting against Piedmont and witnessed the cruel reprisals inflicted on rebellious Italians at Monza, where he was stationed, which caused him to change his loyalties.\n On 19 January 1849 T\u00fcrr crossed the bridge over the Ticino and went over to the Piedmont side. He was immediately placed in command of the newly formed \"Hungarian Legion\", comprising numerous deserters of the Austrian Imperial Army. Its ranks were swelled by the increasing desertion of Hungarian soldiers and officers, crossing the Ticino in small boats every night until the Austrian command moved them away.\n In a parallel development, another Hungarian Legion, headed by Lajos Winkler (1810\u20131861) who would later become T\u00fcrr's close associate, was formed at Venice and fought in defence of the revolutionary Repubblica di San Marco headed by Daniele Manin.[2]\n Thus, T\u00fcrr became involved in the First Italian War of Independence, under the leadership of King Carlo Alberto of Piedmont. The final Austrian victory at Novara dashed the Italian hopes. Carlo Alberto had to abdicate and go into exile,  and Piedmont could no longer carry on the struggle.\n Under the terms of the ceasefire imposed on Piedmont, the Hungarian Legion (and a similar Polish Legion, also composed of deserters from the Austrian Army) were to be disbanded. Privates and NCO's up to the rank of sergeant-major were offered a pardon and a return home. This did not include the officers, but the Austrians did not object to their accepting commissions in the Piedmontese Army.\n However, when T\u00fcrr put it to his men, they voted by acclamation to reject the Austrian pardon, stay together and leave Piedmont in search of a place whose revolution was still holding out. At first they set out for the Roman Republic, but were blocked by the French forces besieging the city (thus, T\u00fcrr's meeting with Garibaldi, at this time directing Rome's defence, was delayed for ten years).\n Next, the Hungarians entered France itself via Nice, where they had to give up their arms and the authorities regarded them with considerable suspicion. The Hungarians, kept for a considerable time in Toulon, conceived the idea of going to the Ottoman Empire, where some Hungarians already got refuge (and many more would follow in the coming years). However, the French disliked this idea, attempting to send them instead to Algiers, where, T\u00fcrr feared, the Hungarian Legion would \"melt down\". He then decided to try heading to Britain in the hope that from there it would be easier to get to Turkey.\n Hearing of the revolutionary ferment at Baden, Germany, where \"the army had joined with the people to overthrow the monarchial government\", T\u00fcrr decided to set out in that direction, also in the hope of eventually returning to a liberated Hungary via Germany. Two contingents of the Hungarian Legion did manage to cross into Germany and reach Baden; a third was stopped by the French and diverted to Folkestone, where the British put them on a ship headed to Turkey. \n Bringing sorely needed reinforcements, T\u00fcrr was warmly welcomed in Baden, made immediately upon arrival a colonel in its revolutionary army, and got three battalions of German troops under his command in addition to the Hungarians who came with him. He did not hold this position long, however, as the Baden revolution soon succumbed to an overwhelming Prussian attack. Together with the overthrown Baden Government, he and his troops had to seek refuge in Switzerland. The victors, in control of occupied Baden, were summarily executing the officers of the revolutionary army who fell into their hands.\n In Bern, T\u00fcrr got the bitter news of the revolution being crushed in his own homeland, too, after prolonged fighting throughout Hungary. He was faced with the prospect of an exile life of indefinite duration, with his life forfeit if he ever tried to go home.\n In the wake of the Hungarian Army's surrender at Vil\u00e1gos (now \u015eiria, Romania) on 13 August 1849, the Austrians in the following month, September, renewed the offer of a free pardon to the men of the Hungarian Legion. This time, a considerable part of them accepted the offer, \"tired of incessant fatigues and disappointments, and having lost all hope of ever being able to fight for their country's cause\", and went back to defeated Hungary.\n The sympathetic Government of Switzerland, described by T\u00fcrr as \"always humane and noble minded\", financed and facilitated the sending the rest of the Hungarian soldiers to America. (This Federal Swiss government was newly installed, composed of the Radicals, who won the Swiss civil war two years earlier, one of the few regimes established by the Revolutions of 1848 that remained in power, inclined to help the less fortunate revolutionary refugees.)\n T\u00fcrr himself, dejected and in bad health, remained in Europe, alternating between Switzerland and Piedmont, and living on a pension that the Piedmont-Sardinian Government granted to him.\n In October 1850, the above-mentioned Captain Lajos Winkler, who had fought at Venice, came over from Lombardy, in command of a party of about a hundred Hungarian privates that he had kept together under discipline. T\u00fcrr's 1856 brochure, mentioning this and other events of the 1850s,[3]\ndoes not relate where Winkler and his men had been and what they had been doing during the year since the fall of Venice; evidently, they had gotten the help of sympathetic Italians.\n With the Hungarian fortunes at their nadir, T\u00fcrr and Winkler devised a plan of sailing with this troop to Montevideo, to join the Liberal forces fighting against Juan Manuel de Rosas in the Uruguayan Civil War. Since the 1830s, the prolonged struggle, especially the perilous Siege of Montevideo, gained the considerable support and sympathy of progressive Europeans, and it was there that Garibaldi first gained his reputation as a freedom fighter. With the European revolutions crushed, the war in Uruguay seemed to offer T\u00fcrr the only place where he could still \"contribute to the protection of freedom against oppression and tyranny\".\n Had T\u00fcrr carried out this plan, his subsequent career might have been considerably different. However, at Genoa, they were faced with a firm Austrian demand for the extradition of the Hungarian deserters. To save them, T\u00fcrr falsely declared that they had all belonged to the former Piedmontese-Hungarian Legion that he had commanded and thus covered by the amnesty offered to these.\n T\u00fcrr gained the Piedmontese Government's permission to take the Hungarian troops to Switzerland, whose friendly Federal Council in turn obtained French permission for them to go to America. As the Austrians had not completely given up their demands, T\u00fcrr personally conducted the exiled troops as they made their way on  foot to Le Havre and saw them safely embarked to their destination.\n From the Austrian point of view, the demand for the Hungarian troops' extradition turned out to be a serious blunder. Instead of letting T\u00fcrr neatly get rid of himself and devote his energies to Latin American struggles, the Austrians themselves ensured that he would stay on in Europe and become an increasingly disturbing thorn in the Habsburg Empire's side.\n Many of the Hungarian \"Forty-Eighters\" who arrived in the US at this time are known to have later fought on the Union side in the American Civil War. The ones sent off by T\u00fcrr might have been among them.\n Between 1850 and 1853 the exile T\u00fcrr, facing execution as a deserter should he return to Hungary, moved between Switzerland, France, England and Piedmont.\n In the early 1850s he became closely involved with fellow exile in Mazzinian  conspiracies, such as the failed Milan uprising of 6 February 1853.\n Following the outbreak of the Crimean War T\u00fcrr was also involved in the plan of Gy\u00f6rgy Klapka, former War Minister of the 1848 revolutionary Hungarian government, to raise a force of Hungarian exiles to fight against Russia, whose intervention in 1848\u201349 had tipped the scales against the Hungarian rebels.\n Even before the Crimean War, a considerable number of exiled Hungarians had already taken service with the Ottomans, some reaching high positions without having to convert to Islam (see Islam in Hungary). During the Siege of Kars in eastern Anatolia, Hungarian exiles took an active part in defending this border city against the invading Russians.\n As T\u00fcrr would later disclose to Italian friends, supporting the Ottoman Empire against the Russian Empire was far less satisfactory to him than taking part in the Italian struggle for liberation. It was more in the nature of \"serving one barbarism, out of the hatred of another barbarism\".[4]\n During the Crimean War, in 1855 T\u00fcrr was required to procure supplies for the British forces in the Danubian Principalities, at the time occupied by Austria though not annexed to the Habsburg Empire. He trusted to the protection of the British and to promises of safe-conduct by locally stationed Austrian officers, which were apparently overruled by Vienna.\n In Bucharest T\u00fcrr was arrested and sent on to Kronstadt (the present Bra\u0219ov), where he was interrogated and court-martialed. He was sentenced to death for desertion and treason (\"seeking to detach Italy and Hungary from Austrian rule\"). However, the Emperor commuted his punishment to perpetual banishment, due to the strong British protests, apparently involving Queen Victoria personally.\n At the time, the whole affair got considerable press attention all over Europe, and on his release T\u00fcrr published a long and detailed account of it.[5]\n It was in 1856, after this intervention to save him that Turr asked for British citizenship. This was granted, but his naturalization was thereafter strongly contested, as can be seen from a then-classified British document stating tersely:\n Naturalization by certificate of secretary of state: Naturalization Act 1844: Certificate obtained by fraud: Colonel Etienne Turr. False statements as to residence and intention to reside. Law officers advised that certificate could not be revoked by secretary of state.[6] The document was declassified only thirty years later and not given particular prominence even then. It does not seem to have influenced Turr's reputation.\n With the outbreak of the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 T\u00fcrr returned to that country and joined Garibaldi's volunteer unit Cacciatori delle Alpi (\"Hunters of the Alps\"). Garibaldi held T\u00fcrr in great esteem and in one speech dubbed him \"The Fearless Hungarian\".\n On the circumstances of Turr's wounding on 15 June 1859, an eye-witness report is provided in a letter by Frank Leward, an English volunteer fighting with Garibaldi:\n Col T\u00fcrr, an' Hungarian who hates the Austrians like sin, had been sent with a lot more of our men to Rezzato a few miles from Brescia on the road to Preschiera and a battalion of Austrians came at them but T\u00fcrr sent them off and was so excited he followed them up too far and fell into a sort of ambuscade they had waiting for him and he got awfully cut up. However he managed to keep the enemy at bay for some time. Castenodolo the place was called I think [where] T\u00fcrr lost a heap of men(...). The General [Garibaldi] was in an awful stew, [he] made me go with him to Castenodolo. On the way we met T\u00fcrr badly wounded in an ambulance he was very bad but tried to sit up and sang out viva Italia then we met a lot more wounded being carried off.[7]  T\u00fcrr had completely recovered from his wounds by the next year (1860), when he again followed Garibaldi and took a major part in the Expedition of the Thousand.\n The 500 Hungarians led by T\u00fcrr, helped by fellow exiles Adolf Mogy\u00f3rody, N\u00e1ndor \u00c9ber and Guszt\u00e1v Frigyesy, were the largest contingent of foreign volunteers fighting with Garibaldi, alongside French, Poles, Swiss, German and other nationalities. Like the Hungarians, most of the other internationals were fighting with a view to follow up the liberation of Italy with that of their own countries from foreign or domestic tyranny (see International Legion).\n In later parts of the campaign, as Garibaldi's campaign gathered momentum and many local recruits in Sicily and South Italy, T\u00fcrr was in command also of an increasing number of Italian troops.\n In Talamone, en route to Sicily, Garibaldi promoted T\u00fcrr to General and included him in the General Staff formed for the expedition. After the capture of Palermo, T\u00fcrr led the force that went through the rugged Sicilian interior towards Messina, while Garibaldi himself went on along the island's north shore. After crossing to the mainland, T\u00fcrr led a force of 1,500 men towards Salerno.\n Franco Catalano, analysing the Battle of Volturnus (1860), accuses Turr of \"reckleness\" that contributed to the initial Garibaldian defeats at Caiazzo and Castel Morrone,[8] but the overall battle ended with Garibaldi's decisive victory, and at the time there were no recriminations.\n In the aftermath of the fighting T\u00fcrr was appointed by Garibaldi as Governor of Naples. In this role he conducted the plebiscite of 21 October 1860, in which the city's population voted overwhelmingly in favour of incorporation in the new Kingdom of Italy.\n During the famous meeting of Garibaldi with King Victor Emmanuel II at Teano, the king refused Garibaldi's request that the soldiers and officers who took part in the Expedition of the Thousand be taken into the Italian Army, and most of them were in fact dismissed. Garibaldi afterwards went back to his home in Caprera, and his later relations with the King and the royal government were often tense. However, Victor Emmanuel not only confirmed T\u00fcrr's rank as a general but also made him a royal aide-de-camp, and subsequently entrusted to T\u00fcrr the handling of some sensitive diplomatic matters. Despite this divergence of political courses, however, T\u00fcrr remained on highly cordial and friendly relations with Garibaldi until the Italian revolutionary's death in 1882.\n Meanwhile, back in Austrian-ruled Hungary, the city of Debrecen on 6 February 1861, declared T\u00fcrr and as Kossuth, Klapka and other exiled nationalists, to be its honorary citizen. This was an act of defiance, as at the time T\u00fcrr stood to be executed out of hand had he attempted to arrive at the city whose honorary citizen he became,[9]\n On 10 September 1861, in Mantua, T\u00fcrr married Adelina Bonaparte Wyse (1838\u20131899), granddaughter of Lucien Bonaparte, the brother of the Emperor Napoleon, which made her a cousin of the then Emperor Napoleon III of France.[10] (Her legal parents were Sir Thomas Wyse, British Minister to Athens, and Princess Maria Letizia Bonaparte, Lucien Bonaparte's daughter; however, her real father was her mother's long-time lover, as Princess Letizia had separated from her husband).\n Moreover, Adelina's sister, Laetitia Marie Wyse Bonaparte, married in the same year the Piedmontese statesman Urbano Rattazzi, who was the Italian Prime Minister several times during the 1860, thus became T\u00fcrr's brother in law.\n T\u00fcrr is mentioned as having, with the help of his wife, carried out extensive diplomatic activity. Among other things, both of them are known to have conducted extensive correspondence with Prince Napoleon, the Emperor's cousin and advisor, a proponent of the anti-Clerical forces in the French imperial court and opponent of the policy of letting French troops preserve the Pope's temporal power over Rome [11]\n Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr and his wife had one son, Raoul T\u00fcrr (1865\u20131906).\n In October 1862, T\u00fcrr acquired from the Milanese Carlo Lattuada a villa in Pallanza, described as \"an elegant dwelling with a garden facing the lake\" (i.e. Lake Maggiore).\n The T\u00fcrrs immediately became prominent figures in the town's social life, as seen in repeated reports in the local paper, the \"Il Lago Maggiore\". The return after a visit to France of \"The Valorous Hungarian General and his Most Beautiful and Amiable Consort, Princess Bonaparte\"  was a major local news item. The couple were hosted and feted by the town's dignitaries (sub-prefect, municipal councillors and the commander of the local National Guard) with a civic band playing various pieces, prominently ones associated with Garibaldi.\n The T\u00fcrrs also took considerable interest in the lower classes. T\u00fcrr became the Honorary President of the local Labourers' Society (Societ\u00e0 Operaia di Pallanza) and gave donations to be distributed among the needy. On 4 November 1862 the paper noted with regret that:\n Now that the summer is over, the T\u00fcrr Family has left and are not expected back until next spring. They carry with them the esteem and affection of the townspeople, who have come to appreciate their rare qualities. Before her departure, Mrs. Adelina T\u00fcrr insisted upon visiting the orphanages, where the children greeted her with a most abundant dose of confetti. It was wonderful to see this scion of one of the greatest and most powerful families of Europe caress and kiss the sons of our labourers, and make the effort of conversing with them in their Pallanzese dialect.[12] In 1876, the Pallanza villa was sold to Cesar Bozzotti, apparently because T\u00fcrr was able to return to Hungary after 1867 (see below) and, therefore, spent less time in Italy.\n In 1863, T\u00fcrr returned to the Romanian Principalities, now under the government of Alexandru Ioan Cuza, who had shown some sympathy to the Hungarian exiles. Following upon an earlier (1861) delegation headed by Klapka, T\u00fcrr sought an agreement on establishing Hungarian weapons and supplies depots on Moldavian soil, with a view to a new uprising against Habsburg rule.\n In case of their independence being achieved, the Hungarians promised \"a full autonomy\" to the Romanian population of  Transylvania. Nevertheless, disagreement on the Question of Transylvania prevented T\u00fcrr and his fellows from reaching an agreement.\n At the time, T\u00fcrr was a confidential adviser to Italian King Vittorio Emanuele. With Venetia still held by the Austrians and a new war a distinct possibility, it was clearly in Italy's interest to have a Hungarian rebellion open a second front for the Austrians.[13]\n In 1866, in coordination with the Third Italian War of Independence and Garibaldi's campaign against the Austrians in the Trentino, T\u00fcrr was assigned to prepare an uprising in Hungary involving Gy\u00f6rgy Klapka and other Hungarian exiles. It was supposed to be launched from Serbian territory, but because of the fast ending of the Prussian-Austrian War including its Italian part, it never came to implementation, and the next year's developments rendered all such plans moot.\n Defeat in the war forced the Emperor Franz Josef to grant a Liberal Constitution as well as a renewed autonomy for the ancient Kingdom of Hungary; the unitary Austria became the dual Austria-Hungary. The changed political climate also included an amnesty for exiles such as T\u00fcrr, who could at last  return to his homeland.\n Not long after his return, T\u00fcrr, no longer an implacable foe of Austrian interests, was informally involved in (ultimately unsuccessful) negotiations aimed at creating an alliance between Austria, Italy and France.\n Though often referred to as \"General T\u00fcrr\" until the end of his life, in practice T\u00fcrr did not take up an active military or political career in Hungary. Rather, he chose to devote his later years to working as a canal architect and engineer.\n Using his wide international experience and personal contacts, he was a leading proponent of the building of navigation canals and river navigation systems in Hungary.[14] On the basis of his international experience, T\u00fcrr was charged with \u00e9laborating a plan for navigable canals connecting the Danube and Tisza rivers.\n T\u00fcrr was deeply involved with the Panama Canal at its earlier stage, being himself the President of the \"Societe Civile Internationale du Canal Interoceanique\" that proposed to build it.[15]  In 1876, T\u00fcrr as well as B\u00e9la Gerster, a younger Hungarian engineer who would be his partner in later projects, accompanied Ferdinand de Lesseps in an international expedition with the task of locating the most suitable route of an interoceanic canal that would eventually become the Panama Canal.\n However, T\u00fcrr was no longer involved in later stages of the French Panama project, having shifted his interest and gave his full attention to another canal, closer to home (see below). This saved T\u00fcrr from public responsibility for the fiasco of the collapse of French Panama project and the appalling loss of thousands of workers to disease at Panama.\n After 1881, T\u00fcrr and Gerster were involved with the Greek Government's major project of planning and implementing the Corinth Canal, a project that gained considerable international attention. In his 1883 travel book, \"To the Gold Coast for Gold\",  Richard Francis Burton mentioned meeting \"that talented and energetic soldier, General T\u00fcrr\" in Venice, and predicted that the hitherto impoverished Patras \"will have a fine time when [T\u00fcrr] begins the piercing of the Isthmus.\"\n In 1888, the company constructing the canal failed, putting the project's completion in danger. T\u00fcrr then led a successful effort to get governments and individuals to invest further sums, so that on 6 August 1893, King George I of Greece and his wife, Queen Olga could solemnly inaugurate the artificial waterway.\n Also in partnership with Gerster, T\u00fcrr formulated monumental plans of water-supply engineering in Hungary itself. As well as promoting the canalization of the Danube he was distinguished for supporting the newborn Hungarian national industry.\n Like other Hungarian Nationalists, T\u00fcrr in his later years was mainly concerned, not with confronting Austrian rule, a goal mostly if not completely achieved through the compromise of 1867, but in preserving Hungarian territory and interests against the demands of other nationalities.\n In particular, T\u00fcrr was opposed to the Transylvanian Memorandum movement of 1892, whose initiators demanded greater autonomy for Romanians, a demand seen as the prelude for altogether detaching Transylvania from Hungarian rule and therefore causing the Manifesto's organisers to be imprisoned by the Hungarian authorities.\n In 1894 and 1895, T\u00fcrr published articles condemning the Memorandum participants and their Bucharest-based partisans.[16] One of the latter, V. A. Urechia, answered in kind in a series of articles of his own, debating T\u00fcrr on the pages of the European press and in various international forums.\n In 1878, the International Peace Congress (\"Congr\u00e8s International de la Paix\") was held in Paris, bringing together a great a variety of peace activists from all over Europe to debate ways of working to prevent war. One of the organizers, the Swiss Valentine de Sellon who would later write a book on the congress [17] noted with great satisfaction the participation of workers and women, and \"even [of] a former general\".[18] The former general referred to was Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr.\n From that time until his death, T\u00fcrr would increasingly become known in the role of \"The Pacifist General\", who became \"a prominent personality of the international peace movement\".[19] In the 1890s, T\u00fcrr was \"a regular fixture\" in the annual Universal Peace Congresses, held every year at a different location. In 1896 he was elected President of the Seventh Congress, held at Budapest.\n The well-known Austrian pacifist Bertha Von Suttner recalls in her memoires the great impression of meeting, on that occasion, \"the old warrior, General T\u00fcrr\" (he was seventy one at the time) and hearing from him that \"he had seen so much of war that he came to thoroughly detest it\".[20]\n T\u00fcrr recalled, and Von Suttner later published, some horrors that he had witnessed during the Expedition of the Thousand, which had not been published in 1860 itself. For example, entering a village and discovering the bodies of Bourbon soldiers who had been burned to death by the inhabitants. When Garibaldi became extremely furious with the villagers for having perpetrated such an act, they responded that it was done in retaliation for the soldiers having earlier set houses on fire in the village and prevented their inhabitants from escaping.[21]\n T\u00fcrr was the first person known to have used in public the term \"The Yellow Peril\".[22] He used it in June 1895; in an article mainly concerned with Otto von Bismarck, there was a passage referring to Japan's recent victory over China where T\u00fcrr remarked: \"The 'yellow peril' is more threatening than ever. Japan has made in a few years as much progress as other nations have made in centuries.\" This was widely republished and translated throughout the world (the quotation here is from the text published at the time in an Ohio paper, The Sandusky Register).[23]\n A few months later, in September 1895, Kaiser Wilhelm II took up the term and made extensive use of it, being indeed often credited as its originator. As interpreted by the German Emperor (and subsequently, by many others) this implied a concrete threat by \"Yellow Hordes\" in the Far East, poised to invade and overwhelm the West by sheer numbers. This attitude to \"Yellow-skinned people\" had very concrete results in Wilhelm, a few years later, explicitly exhorting German troops involved in putting down the Boxer Rebellion in China to particularly ruthless and cruel conduct.\n There is, however, no record of T\u00fcrr sharing such attitudes. In fact, \"General Etienne Turr, Buda\" is duly noted in the list of participants at the Tenth Universal Peace Congress held at Glasgow in 1901, where that Western expedition against the Boxer Rebellion, in the previous year, was strongly condemned. In that gathering, Dr. Spence Watson got applause when stating at the podium that \"The swooping down of the Christian nations on China [was] the most detestable bit of greed that history records\". The conference as a whole adopted resolutions clearly condemning that Western intervention in China (though in milder terms) and stating that defence of Western missionaries active in non-European countries, or of connverts to Christianity, was not an acceptable reason for waging war.[24]\n The transcript does not record, however, any speech made by T\u00fcrr himself, who was then 76  and had recently lost his wife.\n T\u00fcrr's wife Adelina died on 8 July 1899 at Berck, France. In his last years, T\u00fcrr spent much of his time in Paris. He died in Budapest on 3 May 1908. His son Raoul predeceased him in 1906.\n He was survived by his granddaughter Maria Stephanie T\u00fcrr (1895\u20131994).[25] Today, there are only a few descendants of Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr and the granddaughter of Lucien Bonaparte, Adelina.\n Garibaldi and Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr shaking hands on the base of Garibaldi's bust\n T\u00fcrr plaque at the Baj\u00e1 Museum\n The Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr Museum in Baja\n Memorial plaque in Baja\n Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr Bridge over the Danube\n Memorial plaque to Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr and B\u00e9la Gerster in Greek, Hungarian and English at the Corinth Canal\n Plaque in the Istvan Turr Grammar School, Papa, Hungary\n Statue of T\u00fcrr in Rome\n ", "tags": ["Hungarian soldiers", "People of the Revolutions of 1848", "People of the Italian unification", "People from Baja, Hungary", "1825 births", "1908 deaths", "Hungarian canal engineers", "Members of the Expedition of the Thousand", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from January 2020", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with Romanian-language sources (ro)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Use mdy dates from June 2013", "Articles containing Italian-language text", "Articles containing French-language text", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThe native form of this personal name is T\u00fcrr Istv\u00e1n.\u00a0This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nIstv\u00e1n T\u00fcrrT\u00fcrr Istvan, Stefano T\u00fcrr, \u00c9tienne T\u00fcrrBorn(1825-08-10)10 August 1825Baja, HungaryDied3 May 1908(1908-05-03) (aged\u00a082)BudapestAllegiance\u00a0Austrian Empire (deserted) \n\u00a0Hungarian Revolutionary Army\n1849 Hungarian Legion (Kingdom of Piedmont)\n1849 Baden Revolutionary Army\nBritish Army (Crimean War) \nExpedition of the Thousand (Garibaldi) \n\nRoyal Italian ArmyRankLieutenant in the Hungarian Revolutionary Army,\nColonel in the 1849 Baden Revolutionary Army,\n\nGeneral in the Royal Italian ArmyOther\u00a0workCanal architectEngineerPeace Activist\nIstv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr (Italian: Stefano T\u00fcrr, French: \u00c9tienne T\u00fcrr), (10 August 1825 in Baja, Hungary \u2013 3 May 1908 in Budapest[1]) was a Hungarian soldier,   revolutionary, canal architect and engineer, remembered in Italy for his role in that country's unification and his association with Garibaldi.

His mother was Ter\u00e9zia Udvary, whose father was a medical doctor. When young he was not a diligent pupil and left school early. As a teenager he tried his father's profession as well as working in a mill and as an unskilled mason, but did not show great aptitude for any of these three jobs.\nThe first time he tried to enlist in the Austrian Army he was rejected, but on his re-application in 1842 he was accepted at the age of 17. Moreover, officers found in him a hitherto unnoticed promise and encouraged him to improve himself and undergo officer's training at P\u00e9cs. By 1848 he was already a military engineer at the rank of lieutenant in a Hungarian grenadier regiment.\n\nDeserting the Austrian Army, fighting for the 1848 Revolution in Italy[edit]\nAt the time when the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 engulfed his homeland, T\u00fcrr was stationed in Lombardy, Italy. He was involved in early fighting against Piedmont and witnessed the cruel reprisals inflicted on rebellious Italians at Monza, where he was stationed, which caused him to change his loyalties.\nOn 19 January 1849 T\u00fcrr crossed the bridge over the Ticino and went over to the Piedmont side. He was immediately placed in command of the newly formed \"Hungarian Legion\", comprising numerous deserters of the Austrian Imperial Army. Its ranks were swelled by the increasing desertion of Hungarian soldiers and officers, crossing the Ticino in small boats every night until the Austrian command moved them away.\nIn a parallel development, another Hungarian Legion, headed by Lajos Winkler (1810\u20131861) who would later become T\u00fcrr's close associate, was formed at Venice and fought in defence of the revolutionary Repubblica di San Marco headed by Daniele Manin.[2]\nThus, T\u00fcrr became involved in the First Italian War of Independence, under the leadership of King Carlo Alberto of Piedmont. The final Austrian victory at Novara dashed the Italian hopes. Carlo Alberto had to abdicate and go into exile,  and Piedmont could no longer carry on the struggle.\n\nFrom Italy to Baden[edit]\nUnder the terms of the ceasefire imposed on Piedmont, the Hungarian Legion (and a similar Polish Legion, also composed of deserters from the Austrian Army) were to be disbanded. Privates and NCO's up to the rank of sergeant-major were offered a pardon and a return home. This did not include the officers, but the Austrians did not object to their accepting commissions in the Piedmontese Army.\nHowever, when T\u00fcrr put it to his men, they voted by acclamation to reject the Austrian pardon, stay together and leave Piedmont in search of a place whose revolution was still holding out. At first they set out for the Roman Republic, but were blocked by the French forces besieging the city (thus, T\u00fcrr's meeting with Garibaldi, at this time directing Rome's defence, was delayed for ten years).\nNext, the Hungarians entered France itself via Nice, where they had to give up their arms and the authorities regarded them with considerable suspicion. The Hungarians, kept for a considerable time in Toulon, conceived the idea of going to the Ottoman Empire, where some Hungarians already got refuge (and many more would follow in the coming years). However, the French disliked this idea, attempting to send them instead to Algiers, where, T\u00fcrr feared, the Hungarian Legion would \"melt down\". He then decided to try heading to Britain in the hope that from there it would be easier to get to Turkey.\nHearing of the revolutionary ferment at Baden, Germany, where \"the army had joined with the people to overthrow the monarchial government\", T\u00fcrr decided to set out in that direction, also in the hope of eventually returning to a liberated Hungary via Germany. Two contingents of the Hungarian Legion did manage to cross into Germany and reach Baden; a third was stopped by the French and diverted to Folkestone, where the British put them on a ship headed to Turkey. \nBringing sorely needed reinforcements, T\u00fcrr was warmly welcomed in Baden, made immediately upon arrival a colonel in its revolutionary army, and got three battalions of German troops under his command in addition to the Hungarians who came with him. He did not hold this position long, however, as the Baden revolution soon succumbed to an overwhelming Prussian attack. Together with the overthrown Baden Government, he and his troops had to seek refuge in Switzerland. The victors, in control of occupied Baden, were summarily executing the officers of the revolutionary army who fell into their hands.\nIn Bern, T\u00fcrr got the bitter news of the revolution being crushed in his own homeland, too, after prolonged fighting throughout Hungary. He was faced with the prospect of an exile life of indefinite duration, with his life forfeit if he ever tried to go home.\n\nSending exiles to America[edit]\nIn the wake of the Hungarian Army's surrender at Vil\u00e1gos (now \u015eiria, Romania) on 13 August 1849, the Austrians in the following month, September, renewed the offer of a free pardon to the men of the Hungarian Legion. This time, a considerable part of them accepted the offer, \"tired of incessant fatigues and disappointments, and having lost all hope of ever being able to fight for their country's cause\", and went back to defeated Hungary.\nThe sympathetic Government of Switzerland, described by T\u00fcrr as \"always humane and noble minded\", financed and facilitated the sending the rest of the Hungarian soldiers to America. (This Federal Swiss government was newly installed, composed of the Radicals, who won the Swiss civil war two years earlier, one of the few regimes established by the Revolutions of 1848 that remained in power, inclined to help the less fortunate revolutionary refugees.)\nT\u00fcrr himself, dejected and in bad health, remained in Europe, alternating between Switzerland and Piedmont, and living on a pension that the Piedmont-Sardinian Government granted to him.\nIn October 1850, the above-mentioned Captain Lajos Winkler, who had fought at Venice, came over from Lombardy, in command of a party of about a hundred Hungarian privates that he had kept together under discipline. T\u00fcrr's 1856 brochure, mentioning this and other events of the 1850s,[3]\ndoes not relate where Winkler and his men had been and what they had been doing during the year since the fall of Venice; evidently, they had gotten the help of sympathetic Italians.\nWith the Hungarian fortunes at their nadir, T\u00fcrr and Winkler devised a plan of sailing with this troop to Montevideo, to join the Liberal forces fighting against Juan Manuel de Rosas in the Uruguayan Civil War. Since the 1830s, the prolonged struggle, especially the perilous Siege of Montevideo, gained the considerable support and sympathy of progressive Europeans, and it was there that Garibaldi first gained his reputation as a freedom fighter. With the European revolutions crushed, the war in Uruguay seemed to offer T\u00fcrr the only place where he could still \"contribute to the protection of freedom against oppression and tyranny\".\nHad T\u00fcrr carried out this plan, his subsequent career might have been considerably different. However, at Genoa, they were faced with a firm Austrian demand for the extradition of the Hungarian deserters. To save them, T\u00fcrr falsely declared that they had all belonged to the former Piedmontese-Hungarian Legion that he had commanded and thus covered by the amnesty offered to these.\nT\u00fcrr gained the Piedmontese Government's permission to take the Hungarian troops to Switzerland, whose friendly Federal Council in turn obtained French permission for them to go to America. As the Austrians had not completely given up their demands, T\u00fcrr personally conducted the exiled troops as they made their way on  foot to Le Havre and saw them safely embarked to their destination.\nFrom the Austrian point of view, the demand for the Hungarian troops' extradition turned out to be a serious blunder. Instead of letting T\u00fcrr neatly get rid of himself and devote his energies to Latin American struggles, the Austrians themselves ensured that he would stay on in Europe and become an increasingly disturbing thorn in the Habsburg Empire's side.\nMany of the Hungarian \"Forty-Eighters\" who arrived in the US at this time are known to have later fought on the Union side in the American Civil War. The ones sent off by T\u00fcrr might have been among them.\n\nMazzinian conspiracies and the Crimean War[edit]\nBetween 1850 and 1853 the exile T\u00fcrr, facing execution as a deserter should he return to Hungary, moved between Switzerland, France, England and Piedmont.\nIn the early 1850s he became closely involved with fellow exile in Mazzinian  conspiracies, such as the failed Milan uprising of 6 February 1853.\nFollowing the outbreak of the Crimean War T\u00fcrr was also involved in the plan of Gy\u00f6rgy Klapka, former War Minister of the 1848 revolutionary Hungarian government, to raise a force of Hungarian exiles to fight against Russia, whose intervention in 1848\u201349 had tipped the scales against the Hungarian rebels.\nEven before the Crimean War, a considerable number of exiled Hungarians had already taken service with the Ottomans, some reaching high positions without having to convert to Islam (see Islam in Hungary). During the Siege of Kars in eastern Anatolia, Hungarian exiles took an active part in defending this border city against the invading Russians.\nAs T\u00fcrr would later disclose to Italian friends, supporting the Ottoman Empire against the Russian Empire was far less satisfactory to him than taking part in the Italian struggle for liberation. It was more in the nature of \"serving one barbarism, out of the hatred of another barbarism\".[4]\n\nArrest by the Austrians, court martial, release[edit]\nDuring the Crimean War, in 1855 T\u00fcrr was required to procure supplies for the British forces in the Danubian Principalities, at the time occupied by Austria though not annexed to the Habsburg Empire. He trusted to the protection of the British and to promises of safe-conduct by locally stationed Austrian officers, which were apparently overruled by Vienna.\nIn Bucharest T\u00fcrr was arrested and sent on to Kronstadt (the present Bra\u0219ov), where he was interrogated and court-martialed. He was sentenced to death for desertion and treason (\"seeking to detach Italy and Hungary from Austrian rule\"). However, the Emperor commuted his punishment to perpetual banishment, due to the strong British protests, apparently involving Queen Victoria personally.\nAt the time, the whole affair got considerable press attention all over Europe, and on his release T\u00fcrr published a long and detailed account of it.[5]\n\nDisputed British naturalization[edit]\nIt was in 1856, after this intervention to save him that Turr asked for British citizenship. This was granted, but his naturalization was thereafter strongly contested, as can be seen from a then-classified British document stating tersely:\n\nNaturalization by certificate of secretary of state: Naturalization Act 1844: Certificate obtained by fraud: Colonel Etienne Turr. False statements as to residence and intention to reside. Law officers advised that certificate could not be revoked by secretary of state.[6]\nThe document was declassified only thirty years later and not given particular prominence even then. It does not seem to have influenced Turr's reputation.\n\n1859 fighting, wounded at Brescia[edit]\nWith the outbreak of the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 T\u00fcrr returned to that country and joined Garibaldi's volunteer unit Cacciatori delle Alpi (\"Hunters of the Alps\"). Garibaldi held T\u00fcrr in great esteem and in one speech dubbed him \"The Fearless Hungarian\".\nOn the circumstances of Turr's wounding on 15 June 1859, an eye-witness report is provided in a letter by Frank Leward, an English volunteer fighting with Garibaldi:\n\nCol T\u00fcrr, an' Hungarian who hates the Austrians like sin, had been sent with a lot more of our men to Rezzato a few miles from Brescia on the road to Preschiera and a battalion of Austrians came at them but T\u00fcrr sent them off and was so excited he followed them up too far and fell into a sort of ambuscade they had waiting for him and he got awfully cut up. However he managed to keep the enemy at bay for some time. Castenodolo the place was called I think [where] T\u00fcrr lost a heap of men(...).\nThe General [Garibaldi] was in an awful stew, [he] made me go with him to Castenodolo. On the way we met T\u00fcrr badly wounded in an ambulance he was very bad but tried to sit up and sang out viva Italia then we met a lot more wounded being carried off.[7] \nExpedition of the Thousand, promotion to general[edit]\n General Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr in Palermo, during the 1860 Expedition of the Thousand (photo by Gustave Le Gray).\nT\u00fcrr had completely recovered from his wounds by the next year (1860), when he again followed Garibaldi and took a major part in the Expedition of the Thousand.\nThe 500 Hungarians led by T\u00fcrr, helped by fellow exiles Adolf Mogy\u00f3rody, N\u00e1ndor \u00c9ber and Guszt\u00e1v Frigyesy, were the largest contingent of foreign volunteers fighting with Garibaldi, alongside French, Poles, Swiss, German and other nationalities. Like the Hungarians, most of the other internationals were fighting with a view to follow up the liberation of Italy with that of their own countries from foreign or domestic tyranny (see International Legion).\nIn later parts of the campaign, as Garibaldi's campaign gathered momentum and many local recruits in Sicily and South Italy, T\u00fcrr was in command also of an increasing number of Italian troops.\nIn Talamone, en route to Sicily, Garibaldi promoted T\u00fcrr to General and included him in the General Staff formed for the expedition. After the capture of Palermo, T\u00fcrr led the force that went through the rugged Sicilian interior towards Messina, while Garibaldi himself went on along the island's north shore. After crossing to the mainland, T\u00fcrr led a force of 1,500 men towards Salerno.\nFranco Catalano, analysing the Battle of Volturnus (1860), accuses Turr of \"reckleness\" that contributed to the initial Garibaldian defeats at Caiazzo and Castel Morrone,[8] but the overall battle ended with Garibaldi's decisive victory, and at the time there were no recriminations.\nIn the aftermath of the fighting T\u00fcrr was appointed by Garibaldi as Governor of Naples. In this role he conducted the plebiscite of 21 October 1860, in which the city's population voted overwhelmingly in favour of incorporation in the new Kingdom of Italy.\nDuring the famous meeting of Garibaldi with King Victor Emmanuel II at Teano, the king refused Garibaldi's request that the soldiers and officers who took part in the Expedition of the Thousand be taken into the Italian Army, and most of them were in fact dismissed. Garibaldi afterwards went back to his home in Caprera, and his later relations with the King and the royal government were often tense. However, Victor Emmanuel not only confirmed T\u00fcrr's rank as a general but also made him a royal aide-de-camp, and subsequently entrusted to T\u00fcrr the handling of some sensitive diplomatic matters. Despite this divergence of political courses, however, T\u00fcrr remained on highly cordial and friendly relations with Garibaldi until the Italian revolutionary's death in 1882.\nMeanwhile, back in Austrian-ruled Hungary, the city of Debrecen on 6 February 1861, declared T\u00fcrr and as Kossuth, Klapka and other exiled nationalists, to be its honorary citizen. This was an act of defiance, as at the time T\u00fcrr stood to be executed out of hand had he attempted to arrive at the city whose honorary citizen he became,[9]\n\nWedding and Napoleonic connection[edit]\nOn 10 September 1861, in Mantua, T\u00fcrr married Adelina Bonaparte Wyse (1838\u20131899), granddaughter of Lucien Bonaparte, the brother of the Emperor Napoleon, which made her a cousin of the then Emperor Napoleon III of France.[10] (Her legal parents were Sir Thomas Wyse, British Minister to Athens, and Princess Maria Letizia Bonaparte, Lucien Bonaparte's daughter; however, her real father was her mother's long-time lover, as Princess Letizia had separated from her husband).\nMoreover, Adelina's sister, Laetitia Marie Wyse Bonaparte, married in the same year the Piedmontese statesman Urbano Rattazzi, who was the Italian Prime Minister several times during the 1860, thus became T\u00fcrr's brother in law.\nT\u00fcrr is mentioned as having, with the help of his wife, carried out extensive diplomatic activity. Among other things, both of them are known to have conducted extensive correspondence with Prince Napoleon, the Emperor's cousin and advisor, a proponent of the anti-Clerical forces in the French imperial court and opponent of the policy of letting French troops preserve the Pope's temporal power over Rome [11]\nIstv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr and his wife had one son, Raoul T\u00fcrr (1865\u20131906).\n\nPallanza Dignitary[edit]\nIn October 1862, T\u00fcrr acquired from the Milanese Carlo Lattuada a villa in Pallanza, described as \"an elegant dwelling with a garden facing the lake\" (i.e. Lake Maggiore).\nThe T\u00fcrrs immediately became prominent figures in the town's social life, as seen in repeated reports in the local paper, the \"Il Lago Maggiore\". The return after a visit to France of \"The Valorous Hungarian General and his Most Beautiful and Amiable Consort, Princess Bonaparte\"  was a major local news item. The couple were hosted and feted by the town's dignitaries (sub-prefect, municipal councillors and the commander of the local National Guard) with a civic band playing various pieces, prominently ones associated with Garibaldi.\nThe T\u00fcrrs also took considerable interest in the lower classes. T\u00fcrr became the Honorary President of the local Labourers' Society (Societ\u00e0 Operaia di Pallanza) and gave donations to be distributed among the needy. On 4 November 1862 the paper noted with regret that:\n\nNow that the summer is over, the T\u00fcrr Family has left and are not expected back until next spring. They carry with them the esteem and affection of the townspeople, who have come to appreciate their rare qualities. Before her departure, Mrs. Adelina T\u00fcrr insisted upon visiting the orphanages, where the children greeted her with a most abundant dose of confetti. It was wonderful to see this scion of one of the greatest and most powerful families of Europe caress and kiss the sons of our labourers, and make the effort of conversing with them in their Pallanzese dialect.[12]\nIn 1876, the Pallanza villa was sold to Cesar Bozzotti, apparently because T\u00fcrr was able to return to Hungary after 1867 (see below) and, therefore, spent less time in Italy.\n\nRomanian Negotiations[edit]\nIn 1863, T\u00fcrr returned to the Romanian Principalities, now under the government of Alexandru Ioan Cuza, who had shown some sympathy to the Hungarian exiles. Following upon an earlier (1861) delegation headed by Klapka, T\u00fcrr sought an agreement on establishing Hungarian weapons and supplies depots on Moldavian soil, with a view to a new uprising against Habsburg rule.\nIn case of their independence being achieved, the Hungarians promised \"a full autonomy\" to the Romanian population of  Transylvania. Nevertheless, disagreement on the Question of Transylvania prevented T\u00fcrr and his fellows from reaching an agreement.\nAt the time, T\u00fcrr was a confidential adviser to Italian King Vittorio Emanuele. With Venetia still held by the Austrians and a new war a distinct possibility, it was clearly in Italy's interest to have a Hungarian rebellion open a second front for the Austrians.[13]\n\nPlanned Hungarian uprising in 1866[edit]\nIn 1866, in coordination with the Third Italian War of Independence and Garibaldi's campaign against the Austrians in the Trentino, T\u00fcrr was assigned to prepare an uprising in Hungary involving Gy\u00f6rgy Klapka and other Hungarian exiles. It was supposed to be launched from Serbian territory, but because of the fast ending of the Prussian-Austrian War including its Italian part, it never came to implementation, and the next year's developments rendered all such plans moot.\n\nReturn to Hungary[edit]\n The 42-year-old Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr at the time of his return to Hungary (drawing by K\u00e1roly Rusz, 22 September 1867)\nDefeat in the war forced the Emperor Franz Josef to grant a Liberal Constitution as well as a renewed autonomy for the ancient Kingdom of Hungary; the unitary Austria became the dual Austria-Hungary. The changed political climate also included an amnesty for exiles such as T\u00fcrr, who could at last  return to his homeland.\nNot long after his return, T\u00fcrr, no longer an implacable foe of Austrian interests, was informally involved in (ultimately unsuccessful) negotiations aimed at creating an alliance between Austria, Italy and France.\n\nCanal Architect and Engineer[edit]\nThough often referred to as \"General T\u00fcrr\" until the end of his life, in practice T\u00fcrr did not take up an active military or political career in Hungary. Rather, he chose to devote his later years to working as a canal architect and engineer.\nUsing his wide international experience and personal contacts, he was a leading proponent of the building of navigation canals and river navigation systems in Hungary.[14] On the basis of his international experience, T\u00fcrr was charged with \u00e9laborating a plan for navigable canals connecting the Danube and Tisza rivers.\nT\u00fcrr was deeply involved with the Panama Canal at its earlier stage, being himself the President of the \"Societe Civile Internationale du Canal Interoceanique\" that proposed to build it.[15]  In 1876, T\u00fcrr as well as B\u00e9la Gerster, a younger Hungarian engineer who would be his partner in later projects, accompanied Ferdinand de Lesseps in an international expedition with the task of locating the most suitable route of an interoceanic canal that would eventually become the Panama Canal.\nHowever, T\u00fcrr was no longer involved in later stages of the French Panama project, having shifted his interest and gave his full attention to another canal, closer to home (see below). This saved T\u00fcrr from public responsibility for the fiasco of the collapse of French Panama project and the appalling loss of thousands of workers to disease at Panama.\nAfter 1881, T\u00fcrr and Gerster were involved with the Greek Government's major project of planning and implementing the Corinth Canal, a project that gained considerable international attention. In his 1883 travel book, \"To the Gold Coast for Gold\",  Richard Francis Burton mentioned meeting \"that talented and energetic soldier, General T\u00fcrr\" in Venice, and predicted that the hitherto impoverished Patras \"will have a fine time when [T\u00fcrr] begins the piercing of the Isthmus.\"\nIn 1888, the company constructing the canal failed, putting the project's completion in danger. T\u00fcrr then led a successful effort to get governments and individuals to invest further sums, so that on 6 August 1893, King George I of Greece and his wife, Queen Olga could solemnly inaugurate the artificial waterway.\nAlso in partnership with Gerster, T\u00fcrr formulated monumental plans of water-supply engineering in Hungary itself. As well as promoting the canalization of the Danube he was distinguished for supporting the newborn Hungarian national industry.\n\n1890s Transylvania Controversy[edit]\nLike other Hungarian Nationalists, T\u00fcrr in his later years was mainly concerned, not with confronting Austrian rule, a goal mostly if not completely achieved through the compromise of 1867, but in preserving Hungarian territory and interests against the demands of other nationalities.\nIn particular, T\u00fcrr was opposed to the Transylvanian Memorandum movement of 1892, whose initiators demanded greater autonomy for Romanians, a demand seen as the prelude for altogether detaching Transylvania from Hungarian rule and therefore causing the Manifesto's organisers to be imprisoned by the Hungarian authorities.\nIn 1894 and 1895, T\u00fcrr published articles condemning the Memorandum participants and their Bucharest-based partisans.[16] One of the latter, V. A. Urechia, answered in kind in a series of articles of his own, debating T\u00fcrr on the pages of the European press and in various international forums.\n\n\"The Pacifist General\" of the Universal Peace Congresses[edit]\nIn 1878, the International Peace Congress (\"Congr\u00e8s International de la Paix\") was held in Paris, bringing together a great a variety of peace activists from all over Europe to debate ways of working to prevent war. One of the organizers, the Swiss Valentine de Sellon who would later write a book on the congress [17] noted with great satisfaction the participation of workers and women, and \"even [of] a former general\".[18] The former general referred to was Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr.\nFrom that time until his death, T\u00fcrr would increasingly become known in the role of \"The Pacifist General\", who became \"a prominent personality of the international peace movement\".[19] In the 1890s, T\u00fcrr was \"a regular fixture\" in the annual Universal Peace Congresses, held every year at a different location. In 1896 he was elected President of the Seventh Congress, held at Budapest.\nThe well-known Austrian pacifist Bertha Von Suttner recalls in her memoires the great impression of meeting, on that occasion, \"the old warrior, General T\u00fcrr\" (he was seventy one at the time) and hearing from him that \"he had seen so much of war that he came to thoroughly detest it\".[20]\nT\u00fcrr recalled, and Von Suttner later published, some horrors that he had witnessed during the Expedition of the Thousand, which had not been published in 1860 itself. For example, entering a village and discovering the bodies of Bourbon soldiers who had been burned to death by the inhabitants. When Garibaldi became extremely furious with the villagers for having perpetrated such an act, they responded that it was done in retaliation for the soldiers having earlier set houses on fire in the village and prevented their inhabitants from escaping.[21]\n\n\"Yellow Peril\" and The Boxer Rebellion[edit]\nT\u00fcrr was the first person known to have used in public the term \"The Yellow Peril\".[22] He used it in June 1895; in an article mainly concerned with Otto von Bismarck, there was a passage referring to Japan's recent victory over China where T\u00fcrr remarked: \"The 'yellow peril' is more threatening than ever. Japan has made in a few years as much progress as other nations have made in centuries.\" This was widely republished and translated throughout the world (the quotation here is from the text published at the time in an Ohio paper, The Sandusky Register).[23]\nA few months later, in September 1895, Kaiser Wilhelm II took up the term and made extensive use of it, being indeed often credited as its originator. As interpreted by the German Emperor (and subsequently, by many others) this implied a concrete threat by \"Yellow Hordes\" in the Far East, poised to invade and overwhelm the West by sheer numbers. This attitude to \"Yellow-skinned people\" had very concrete results in Wilhelm, a few years later, explicitly exhorting German troops involved in putting down the Boxer Rebellion in China to particularly ruthless and cruel conduct.\nThere is, however, no record of T\u00fcrr sharing such attitudes. In fact, \"General Etienne Turr, Buda\" is duly noted in the list of participants at the Tenth Universal Peace Congress held at Glasgow in 1901, where that Western expedition against the Boxer Rebellion, in the previous year, was strongly condemned. In that gathering, Dr. Spence Watson got applause when stating at the podium that \"The swooping down of the Christian nations on China [was] the most detestable bit of greed that history records\". The conference as a whole adopted resolutions clearly condemning that Western intervention in China (though in milder terms) and stating that defence of Western missionaries active in non-European countries, or of connverts to Christianity, was not an acceptable reason for waging war.[24]\nThe transcript does not record, however, any speech made by T\u00fcrr himself, who was then 76  and had recently lost his wife.\n\nLast years[edit]\nT\u00fcrr's wife Adelina died on 8 July 1899 at Berck, France. In his last years, T\u00fcrr spent much of his time in Paris. He died in Budapest on 3 May 1908. His son Raoul predeceased him in 1906.\nHe was survived by his granddaughter Maria Stephanie T\u00fcrr (1895\u20131994).[25] Today, there are only a few descendants of Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr and the granddaughter of Lucien Bonaparte, Adelina.\n\nGallery[edit]\n\n\n\n\nGaribaldi and Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr shaking hands on the base of Garibaldi's bust\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\u00fcrr plaque at the Baj\u00e1 Museum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr Museum in Baja\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemorial plaque in Baja\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIstv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr Bridge over the Danube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemorial plaque to Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr and B\u00e9la Gerster in Greek, Hungarian and English at the Corinth Canal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaque in the Istvan Turr Grammar School, Papa, Hungary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatue of T\u00fcrr in Rome\n\n\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Day, Lance; McNeil, Ian, eds.
