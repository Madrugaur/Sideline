{"name": "Lillian K.

L. Moore, known for his segregationist views and for his snubs of African-American students.[5]\n Bradley was born in Tyler, Texas. She earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1938 from Texas College, and a master's degree in mathematics education in 1946 from the University of Michigan.[1] She became a teacher at a segregated black high school in Hawkins, Texas, at Paul Quinn College, and at Texas College, before becoming an assistant professor of mathematics at Prairie View A&M College. There, in 1957\u20131958, she was awarded a National Science Faculty Fellowship, one of only 100 awarded in the inaugural year of the program.[2]\n She completed her doctorate at the University of Texas in July 1960.[2] Her dissertation, in mathematics education, was An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of a Collegiate General Mathematics Course.[6] In 1962 she moved from Prairie View to Texas Southern University, as an associate professor.[7]\n Bradley died in February 1995 at the age of 76.[8]\n \n This article about an American mathematician is a stub.
