{"name": "Willi Rinow", "content": "Willi Ludwig August Rinow (February 28th, 1907 in Berlin \u2013 March 29th, 1979 in Greifswald) was a German mathematician who specialized in differential geometry and topology. Rinow was the son of a schoolteacher. In 1926, he attended the Humboldt University of Berlin, studying mathematics and physics under professors such as Max Planck, Ludwig Bieberbach, and Heinz Hopf.
