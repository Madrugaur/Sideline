Babai studied mathematics at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University from 1968 to 1973, received a Ph.D. from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1975, and received a D.Sc. from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1984.[1][2] He held a teaching position at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University since 1971; in 1987 he took joint positions as a professor in algebra at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd and in computer science at the University of Chicago.
