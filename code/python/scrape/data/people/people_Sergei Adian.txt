He was a professor at the Moscow State University and was known for his work in group theory, especially on the Burnside problem.\n Adian was born near Elizavetpol. He grew up there in an Armenian family. He studied at Yerevan and Moscow pedagogical institutes. His advisor was Pyotr Novikov. He has been working at Moscow State University (MSU) since 1965. Alexander Razborov was one of his students.\n In his first work as a student in 1950, Adian proved that the graph of a function \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n of a real variable satisfying the functional equation \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n+\ny\n)\n=\nf\n(\nx\n)\n+\nf\n(\ny\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)}\n\n and having discontinuities is dense in the plane. (Clearly, all continuous solutions of the equation are linear functions.) This result was not published at the time. About 25 years later the American mathematician Edwin Hewitt from the University of Washington gave preprints of some of his papers to Adian during a visit to MSU, one of which was devoted to exactly the same result, which was published by Hewitt much later.[citation needed]\n By the beginning of 1955, Adian had managed to prove the undecidability of practically all non-trivial invariant group properties, including the undecidability of being isomorphic to a fixed group \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n, for any group \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n. These results constituted his Ph.D. thesis and his first published work. This is one of the most remarkable, beautiful, and general results in algorithmic group theory and is now known as the Adian\u2013Rabin theorem. What distinguishes the first published work by Adian, is its completeness. In spite of numerous attempts, nobody has added anything fundamentally new to the results during the past 50 years. Adian\u2019s result was immediately used by Andrey Markov Jr. in his proof of the algorithmic unsolvability of the classical problem of deciding when topological manifolds are homeomorphic.\n About the Burnside problem:\n Very much like Fermat's Last Theorem in number theory, Burnside\u2019s\nproblem has acted as a catalyst for research in group theory. The fascination exerted by a problem with an extremely simple formulation which then turns out to be extremely difficult has something irresistible about it to the mind of the mathematician.\n Before the work of Novikov and Adian an affirmative answer to the problem was known only for \n\n\n\nn\n\u2208\n{\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n6\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n\\in \\{2,3,4,6\\}}\n\n and the matrix groups. However, this did not hinder the belief in an affirmative answer for any period \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n. The only question was\nto find the right methods for proving it. As later developments showed, this belief was too naive. This just demonstrates that before their work nobody even came close to imagining the nature of the free Burnside group, or the extent to which subtle structures inevitably arose in any serious attempt to investigate it. In fact, there were no methods for proving inequalities in groups given by identities of the\nform \n\n\n\n\nX\n\nn\n\n\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X^{n}=1}\n\n.\n An approach to solving the problem in the negative was first outlined by P. S. Novikov in his note, which appeared in 1959. However, the concrete realization of his ideas encountered serious difficulties, and in 1960, at the insistence of Novikov and his wife Lyudmila Keldysh, Adian settled down to work on the Burnside problem. Completing the project took intensive efforts from both\ncollaborators in the course of eight years, and in 1968 their famous paper appeared, containing a negative solution of the problem for all odd periods \n\n\n\nn\n>\n4381\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n>4381}\n\n, and hence for all multiples of those odd integers as well.\n The solution of the Burnside problem was certainly one of the most outstanding\nand deep mathematical results of the past century. At the same time, this result\nis one of the hardest theorems: just the inductive step of a complicated induction\nused in the proof took up a whole issue of volume 32 of Izvestiya, even lengthened\nby 30 pages. In many respects the work was literally carried to its conclusion by\nthe exceptional persistence of Adian. In that regard it is worth recalling the words\nof Novikov, who said that he had never met a mathematician more \u2018penetrating\u2019\nthan Adian.\n In contrast to the Adian\u2013Rabin theorem, the paper of Adian and Novikov in no way \u2018closed\u2019 the Burnside problem. Moreover,\nover a long period of more than ten years Adian continued to improve and simplify\nthe method they had created and also to adapt the method for solving some other\nfundamental problems in group theory.\n By the beginning of the 1980s, when other contributors\nappeared who mastered the Novikov\u2013Adian method, the theory already\nrepresented a powerful method for constructing and investigating new groups (both\nperiodic and non-periodic) with interesting properties prescribed.\n ", "tags": ["1931 births", "2020 deaths", "21st-century Russian mathematicians", "Group theorists", "Mathematical logicians", "Moscow State University faculty", "Scientists from Ganja, Azerbaijan", "Soviet mathematicians", "Ethnic Armenian academics", "Ethnic Armenian scientists", "Armenian scientists", "Full Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences", "Soviet Armenians", "Articles with Russian-language sources (ru)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles needing additional references from May 2020", "All articles needing additional references", "Articles with multiple maintenance issues", "Articles containing Armenian-language text", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2018", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Russian mathematician\nThis article has multiple issues.
