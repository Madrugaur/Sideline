{"name": "Gerhard Frey", "content": "Gerhard Frey (German: [f\u0281a\u026a]; born 1944) is a German mathematician, known for his work in number theory. His Frey curve, a construction of an elliptic curve from a purported solution to the Fermat equation, was central to Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.[1][2]\n He studied mathematics and physics at the University of T\u00fcbingen, graduating in 1967. He continued his postgraduate studies at Heidelberg University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1970,[3] and his Habilitation in 1973. He was assistant professor at Heidelberg University from 1969\u20131973, professor at the University of Erlangen (1973\u20131975) and at Saarland University (1975\u20131990). Until 2009, he held a chair for number theory at the Institute for Experimental Mathematics at the University of Duisburg-Essen, campus Essen.\n Frey was a visiting scientist at several universities and research institutions, including the Ohio State University, Harvard University, the University of California, Berkeley, the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), the Institute for Advanced Studies at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the Instituto Nacional de Matem\u00e1tica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) in Rio de Janeiro.\n Frey was also the co-editor of the journal Manuscripta Mathematica.\n His research areas are number theory and diophantine geometry, as well as applications to coding theory and cryptography. \nIn 1985, Frey pointed out a connection between Fermat's last theorem and the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, and this connection was made precise shortly thereafter by Jean-Pierre Serre who formulated a conjecture \n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }\n\n and showed that Taniyama-Shimura+\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }\n\n implies Fermat. Kenneth Ribet proved soon after enough of conjecture \n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }\n\n to deduce that the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture implies Fermat's last theorem.[4] This approach provided a framework for the subsequent successful attack on Fermat's last theorem by Andrew Wiles in the 1990s.[5]\n In 1998, Frey proposed the idea of Weil descent attack for elliptic curves over finite fields with composite degree. As a result of this attack, cryptographers lost their interest in these curves.[6]\n Frey was awarded the Gauss medal of the Braunschweigische Wissenschaftliche Gesellschaft in 1996 for his work on Fermat's Last Theorem.[7] Since 1998, he has been a member of the G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences.[8]\n In 2006, he received the Certicom ECC Visionary Award for his contributions to elliptic-curve cryptography.[9]\n ", "tags": ["20th-century German mathematicians", "21st-century mathematicians", "Living people", "1944 births", "University of T\u00fcbingen alumni", "Heidelberg University alumni", "Heidelberg University faculty", "Ohio State University faculty", "University of California, Berkeley faculty", "Harvard University staff", "Modern cryptographers", "Number theorists", "People from Erlangen", "University of Erlangen-Nuremberg faculty", "University of Duisburg-Essen faculty", "Saarland University faculty", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from December 2017", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with dead external links from April 2019", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\nThis article is about the mathematician.
