(Alternatively, he would subtract \n\n\n\n1\n\n/\n\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1/3}\n\n from the interval, equivalent to a perfect fifth down, to keep all of the values greater than 177147, or less than 354294, it's double, effectively transposing them all into the range of a single octave.)\nProceed now from this new value to generate the next tone; repeat until all tones have been generated.\nTo produce an exact calculation, some 26 digits of accuracy would have been required.[5] Instead, by rounding to about 6 digits, his calculations are within 0.0145 cents of exactness, which is a difference much finer than is usually perceptible.
