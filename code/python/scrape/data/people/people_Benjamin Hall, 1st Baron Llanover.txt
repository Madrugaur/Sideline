{"name": "Benjamin Hall, 1st Baron Llanover", "content": "\n Benjamin Hall, 1st Baron Llanover PC (8 November 1802 \u2013 27 April 1867), known as Sir Benjamin Hall between 1838 and 1859, was a Welsh civil engineer and politician.  The famous \"Big Ben\" may have been named for him.\n Hall was a son of the industrialist Benjamin Hall. He went to Westminster School.\n He was a Sheriff of Monmouthshire in 1826. He was elected Member of Parliament for Monmouth in May 1831, but his name was erased from the return already in July of the same year. However, he was successfully re-elected for the same constituency in December 1832.[1] He was instrumental in the passing of the Truck Acts of 1831 and campaigned against the abuse of parliamentary election expenses and championed the right of people in Wales to have religious services in Welsh. He also engaged in bitter controversy with the bishops on the state of the Anglican church in Wales and made attacks on the shameless exploitation of church revenues, complaining of unbounded nepotism.[2] In 1837 he was returned for Marylebone[3] and the following year he was created a baronet.[4]\n He served under Lord Aberdeen and then Lord Palmerston as President of the Board of Health between 1854 and 1855 and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1854.[5] In 1855 he introduced an Act of Parliament which led to the establishment of the Metropolitan Board of Works. He became First Commissioner of Works the same year and was responsible for many environmental and sanitary improvements in London.[6] He oversaw the later stages of the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament, including the installation of the 13.8-tonne hour bell, \"Big Ben\", in the clock tower. He was a tall man and many attribute its name to him.[7] Through his wife, Hall inherited the Llanover estate in Monmouthshire. He remained as First Commissioner of Works under parliament until the Whigs lost power in 1858. The following year he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Llanover, of Llanover and Abercarn in the County of Monmouth.[8] From 1861 to 1867 he was Lord Lieutenant of Monmouthshire.[9]\n Lord Llanover married Augusta, daughter of Benjamin Waddington of Ty Uchaf, Llanover, in 1823. Only one of their daughters reached adulthood. Augusta married Arthur Jones of Llanarth.\nTheir son was Ivor Herbert, 1st Baron Treowen. Lord Llanover died in April 1867, aged 64, when the baronetcy and barony became extinct. Lady Llanover survived him by almost thirty years and died in January 1896.\n ", "tags": ["1802 births", "1867 deaths", "People educated at Westminster School, London", "Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom", "British civil engineers", "Lord-Lieutenants of Monmouthshire", "Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom", "High Sheriffs of Monmouthshire", "Whig (British political party) MPs for Welsh constituencies", "Whig (British political party) MPs for English constituencies", "UK MPs 1831\u20131832", "UK MPs 1832\u20131835", "UK MPs 1835\u20131837", "UK MPs 1837\u20131841", "UK MPs 1841\u20131847", "UK MPs 1847\u20131852", "UK MPs 1852\u20131857", "UK MPs 1857\u20131859", "UK MPs who were granted peerages", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from November 2012", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Use dmy dates from August 2020", "Use British English from March 2012", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nThe Right HonourableThe Lord LlanoverPCPresident of the Board of HealthIn office14 October 1854\u00a0\u2013 13 August 1855MonarchQueen VictoriaPrime MinisterThe Earl of AberdeenThe Viscount PalmerstonPreceded byNew officeSucceeded byWilliam CowperFirst Commissioner of WorksIn office21 July 1855\u00a0\u2013 21 February 1858MonarchQueen VictoriaPrime MinisterThe Viscount PalmerstonPreceded bySir William MolesworthSucceeded byLord John Manners\nPersonal detailsBorn(1802-11-08)8 November 1802Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, WalesDied27 April 1867(1867-04-27) (aged\u00a064)Westminster, London, EnglandNationalityBritishPolitical partyWhigSpouse(s)Augusta Waddington  \u200b(m.\u00a01823)\u200b\nBenjamin Hall, 1st Baron Llanover PC (8 November 1802 \u2013 27 April 1867), known as Sir Benjamin Hall between 1838 and 1859, was a Welsh civil engineer and politician.
