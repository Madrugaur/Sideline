Her observations helped push Sweden into taxing married people separately from their spouses.[4][5]\n Lyttkens grew up in Halmstad and Karlskrona, and moved to Kalmar in 1930. She moved again to Uppsala in 1937 to study mathematics, but her studies were interrupted by marriage and children.[6] She earned a licentiate in 1951,[6] and completed her Ph.D. at Uppsala University in 1956. Her dissertation, The Remainder In Tauberian Theorems, concerned Tauberian theorems and was jointly supervised by Arne Beurling and Lennart Carleson.[7] She was the third woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics in Sweden, after Louise Petr\u00e9n-Overton in 1911 and Ingrid Lindstr\u00f6m in 1947.[2]\n Although Sofya Kovalevskaya had become a full professor of mathematics in  a private university in Stockholm in 1884,[8] women were forbidden from holding public university positions in Sweden until 1925,[8][3] and both Petr\u00e9n and Lindstr\u00f6m became schoolteachers.[2] Lyttkens obtained a permanent position as a senior lecturer at Uppsala University in 1963,[2][3] and in 1970 she became the university's first female inspektor (an honorary chair of a student union), for the Kalmar nation.[3] She retired in 1984.[1]\n Lyttkens was the daughter of Swedish sculptor Anna Petrus and her husband, physician Harald Lyttkens.
