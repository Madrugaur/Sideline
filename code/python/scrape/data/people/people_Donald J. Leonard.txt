Leonard (born July 11, 1933) is an American electrical engineer and AT&T executive, who received the 1996 IEEE Simon Ramo Medal.[1]\n Born in New York City, Leonard studied Electrical Engineering at the New York University in the 1950s, where he received his BEE in 1956 and his MEE in 1960.[2]\n After graduation Leonard started his career as researcher at the New York University Research Lab.[3] After working for the New York Telephone Company some time, he joined AT&T Bell labs in 1956. Here he started his lifelong career at AT&T working on the further development of the Transmission System 1 (T-1), which were introduced by Bell Labs in 1962. He later supervised the development of a Pulse-code modulation for the Telstar. In 1963 he moved to Bell Labs in Merrimack Valley, where he was director of the Transmission Technology Laboratory from 1968 to 1970.
