Until November 1931 he taught mathematics in a school for workers. From 1930 he was an external student of the Pedagogic Institute of Saratov State University, where he graduated in 1933.[1] He began graduate studies at the Ural Industrial Institute under the outside tutelage of Alexandr G. Kurosh (of the University of Moscow).[2] A remarkable student, Chernikov was made head of the Ural Mathematics department (1939\u20131946) immediately after earning his PhD in 1938, even before defending his DSc in 1940.[3] He went on to be head of mathematical departments at Ural State University (1946\u20131951), Perm State University (1951\u20131961), the Steklov Institute of Mathematics (1961\u20131964), and finally the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine from 1964 until days before his death in 1987.[3] During his career, he trained more than 40 PhD and 7 DSc students,[3] and published dozens of papers that remained influential 100 years after his birth.[4]\n Chernikov is credited with introducing a number of fundamental concepts to group theory, including the locally finite group, and nilpotent group.[3][5] As with many of his other contributions, these allow infinite groups to be partially or locally solved, establishing important early links between finite and infinite group theories. Later in his career, he was hailed as \"one of the pioneers of linear programming\",[3] for his breakthrough algebraic theory of linear inequalities.[6]\n ", "tags": ["Russian mathematicians", "1912 births", "1987 deaths", "Recipients of the Order of Friendship of Peoples", "People from Sergiyev Posad", "Members of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine", "Perm State University faculty", "Ural State University faculty", "CS1 errors: dates", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from May 2018", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Sergei Nikolaevich Chernikov\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432Born(1912-05-11)11 May 1912Sergiyev Posad, RussiaDied23 January 1987(1987-01-23) (aged\u00a074)NationalityRussianKnown\u00a0forGroup theory, linear programmingAwardsKrylov Prize (1973)Order of Friendship of Peoples (1982)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsDoctoral advisorAleksandr Gennadievich KuroshNotable studentsVictor Glushkov\n\nSergei Nikolaevich Chernikov (11 May 1912 \u2013 23 January 1987; Russian: \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432) was a Russian mathematician who contributed significantly to the development of infinite group theory and linear inequalities.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Contributions\n3 Published works\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nChernikov was born on 11 May 1912 in Sergiyev Posad, in Moscow Oblast, Russia, to Nikolai Nikolaevich, a priest, and Anna Alekseevna, a housewife.[1] \nAfter graduating from secondary school, he worked as a labourer, as a driver, as a book-keeper and as an accountant.
