She was also a publication and sales manager of the McGraw-Hill Construction Daily.[7]  In 1927, she was the first woman admitted to full membership to the American Society of Civil Engineers.  In 1945, she became the manager of Business News.\n In 1929, Eaves originated and compiled the first national inventory of municipal and industrial sewage disposal facilities.[8] Next, she compiled statistics on needed construction, which helped revitalize the construction industry during the Great Depression. After World War II, Eaves organized and directed ENR\u2019s measurement of \u201cPost War Planning\u201d by the construction industry that was used as the official progress report of the industry.[8]\n In total, she was associated with McGraw-Hill's Engineering News-Record, a weekly trade publication, for 37 years.[1]\n She retired in 1963 but continued practicing as an adviser to the National Commission on Urban Affairs on the subject of housing costs. She advised the International Executive Service Corps about construction costs in Iran.[9] In 1967, Eaves attended the second International Conference of Women Engineers and Scientists (ICWES) in Cambridge, UK,[10] and in 1972, she wrote the obituary for fellow engineer, Ruth Shafer, chair of the first ICWES.[11]\n In 1974, she received the George Norlin Silver Medal, the highest alumni award given by the University of Colorado and, in 1979, she was the first woman to receive an honorary lifetime membership to the American Association of Cost Engineers. \n Eaves was honoured with the Fellow award at the 1980 Society of Women Engineers National Convention (Conference) in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, having been a member of the organisation since 1950.[12]\n Elsie Eaves died March 27, 1983 in Roslyn, New York, aged 84.[13]\n ", "tags": ["1898 births", "1983 deaths", "American civil engineers", "Disease-related deaths in New York (state)", "University of Colorado alumni", "American women engineers", "People from Idaho Springs, Colorado", "20th-century American engineers", "Women engineers", "Women's Engineering Society", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Elsie EavesBornMay 5, 1898Idaho Springs, Colorado, United StatesDiedMarch 27, 1983(1983-03-27) (aged\u00a084)Roslyn, New YorkNationalityU.S.EducationUniversity of Colorado at BoulderOccupationEngineerEngineering careerDisciplineCivilInstitutionsAmerican Society of Civil EngineersAmerican Association of Cost EngineersChi Epsilon fraternityAwardsUniversity of Colorado George Norlin Silver Medal\n\nElsie Eaves (May 5, 1898 \u2013 March 27, 1983) was a pioneering American female engineer,[1] the first female associate member of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), and a founding member of the American Association of Cost Engineers (now AACE International; the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering).[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Achievements\n4 Biographical Listings\n5 References\n6 External links\n7 Bibliography\n8 Further reading\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nEaves was born in Idaho Springs, Colorado and earned her civil engineering degree at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1920.[1]\nIn 1918, Eaves was elected as the first female president of the school\u2019s student engineering society, the Combined Engineers, such an unusual occurrence that the news received national coverage in engineering publications.[3] She supported Lou Alta Melton and Hilda Counts in creating the American Society of Women Engineers and Architects in 1919.[3]\nAt the age of 22, she was the first woman to earn a degree in civil engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder.[4] Eaves began her engineering experience before she received her university degree.\n\nCareer[edit]\nEaves was a draftsman for the United States Bureau of Public Roads in Denver, Colorado, and then the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad Company.[5]\nShe joined the Women's Engineering Society (at the time the only organisation for women engineers in the world) in 1925, and continued as a member throughout her career.[6]\nIn 1926 Eaves started working for McGraw-Hill in New York City for the Engineering News-Record (ENR) Department.
