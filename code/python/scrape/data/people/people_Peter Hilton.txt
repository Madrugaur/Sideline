{"name": "Peter Hilton", "content": "\n Peter John Hilton (7 April 1923[1]\u00a0\u2013 6 November 2010[2]) was a British mathematician, noted for his contributions to homotopy theory and for code-breaking during the Second World War.[3]\n Hilton was born in London, the son of Elizabeth Amelia (Freedman) and Mortimer Jacob Hilton, and was educated at St Paul's School.[4][5][6] He won a scholarship to the Queen's College, Oxford in 1940.[4]\n During the Second World War, as an undergraduate, Hilton was obliged to enroll in training with the Royal Artillery, and was scheduled for conscription in summer 1942.[7] Instead, he was interviewed by a team touring universities looking for mathematicians with knowledge of German, and was offered a position in the Foreign Office without being told the nature of the work. The team was, in fact, recruiting on behalf of the Government Code and Cypher School. He accepted, and, aged 18, arrived at wartime codebreaking station Bletchley Park on 12 January 1942.[8]\n He was initially put to work on Naval Enigma in Hut 8. In late 1942, he transferred to work on German teleprinter ciphers.[7] A special section known as the \"Testery\" had been formed in July 1942 to work on one such cipher, codenamed \"Tunny\", and Hilton was one of the early members of the group.[9] His role was to devise ways to deal with changes in Tunny, and to liaise with another section working on Tunny, the \"Newmanry\", which complemented the hand-methods of the Testery with specialised codebreaking machinery.[9] Occasionally the same message was sent repeated, a major security blunder that Bletchley park called a \"depth.\" Hilton derived great satisfaction from being able to look at the encoded texts coming from two separate teleprinter messages, combine them and extract two messages in clear German.[10][11]\nHilton obtained his DPhil in 1949 from Oxford University under the supervision of John Henry Whitehead. His dissertation was titled, \"Calculation of the Homotopy Groups of An2-polyhedra\".[12]\n \nHilton recounted his experience working with Alan Turing in Hut 8 in his \"Reminiscences of Bletchley Park\" from A Century of Mathematics in America:[13] I had the good fortune to work closely with Alan Turing and to know him well for the last 12 years of his short life. It is a rare experience to meet an authentic genius. Those of us privileged to inhabit the world of scholarship are familiar with the intellectual stimulation furnished by talented colleagues. We can admire the ideas they share with us and are usually able to understand their source; we may even often believe that we ourselves could have created such concepts and originated such thoughts. However, the experience of sharing the intellectual life of a genius is entirely different; one realizes that one is in the presence of an intelligence, a sensibility of such profundity and originality that one is filled with wonder and excitement. Alan Turing was such a genius, and those, like myself, who had the astonishing and unexpected opportunity, created by the strange exigencies of the Second World War, to be able to count Turing as colleague and friend will never forget that experience, nor can we ever lose its immense benefit to us. Hilton echoed similar thoughts in the Nova PBS documentary Decoding Nazi Secrets.[14]\n In 1958, he became the Mason Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Birmingham.[4] He moved to the United States in 1962 to be Professor of Mathematics at Cornell University, a post he held until 1971.[1] From 1971 to 1973, he held a joint appointment as Fellow of the Battelle Seattle Research Center and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington. On 1 September 1972, he was appointed Louis D. Beaumont University Professor at Case Western Reserve University; on 1 September 1973, he took up the appointment. In 1982, he was appointed Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at Binghamton University, becoming Emeritus in 2003. Latterly he spent each spring semester as Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at the University of Central Florida.\n Hilton's principal research interests were in algebraic topology, homological algebra, categorical algebra and mathematics education. He published 15 books and over 600 articles in these areas, some jointly with colleagues.\n Hilton is featured in the book Mathematical People.[15]\n Named after Hilton is Hilton's theorem (1955) on the homotopy groups of a wedge of spheres.\n \nHilton constructed the 51-letter English palindrome while working at Bletchley Park as a recreation from his job as a code breaker.  [16]  \"Doc note, I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod.\" He did not use paper or pencil while composing this palindrome but  simply lay on his bed, eyes closed, and assembled it in his mind over one long night. It took him five hours. [17]\n Peter Hilton died on  6 November 2010 in Binghamton, New York, United States, at age 87.\n Hilton is portrayed by actor Matthew Beard in the 2014 film The Imitation Game, which tells the tale of Alan Turing and the cracking of Nazi Germany's Enigma code.\n ", "tags": ["1923 births", "2010 deaths", "20th-century British mathematicians", "21st-century British mathematicians", "Topologists", "People educated at St Paul's School, London", "Alumni of The Queen's College, Oxford", "Bletchley Park people", "Academics of the Victoria University of Manchester", "Academics of the University of Birmingham", "State University of New York faculty", "Cornell University faculty", "Binghamton University faculty", "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences faculty", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the ODNB", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from February 2020", "EngvarB from February 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Articles needing additional references from July 2012", "All articles needing additional references", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "British mathematician\n\n\nThis article is about the British mathematician.
