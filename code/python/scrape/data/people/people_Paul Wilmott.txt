{"name": "Paul Wilmott", "content": "Paul Wilmott (born 8 November 1959)[1] is an English researcher, consultant and lecturer in quantitative finance.[2] He is best known as the author of various academic and practitioner texts on risk and derivatives,[2] for Wilmott magazine and Wilmott.com, a quantitative finance portal, and for his prescient warnings about the misuse of mathematics in finance.[3]\n One of two sons of an accountant and an entrepreneurial mother, Wilmott attended grammar school in Birkenhead, and read mathematics at St Catherine's College, Oxford. He stayed on to get a DPhil[4] in fluid mechanics in 1985.[5]\n After working on mathematical modelling for various industries, Wilmott learned of the potential uses of mathematics in quantitative finance from a friend, and decided to become a consultant in the subject. He is currently the co-owner and Course Director for the Certificate in Quantitative Finance, a half-year distance learning course on mathematical finance at Fitch Learning, a London-based company providing training for the financial services industry.[6] He is a director of Wilmott Electronic Media, which manages Wilmott.com, a website for the quantitative analyst community; and is a director of Paul & Dominic Quant Recruitment.[7]\nHe was a founding partner of Caissa Capital, a volatility arbitrage hedge fund, since closed; founded the Diploma in Mathematical Finance at Oxford University;[8] and established the journal Applied Mathematical Finance.[9]\n Wilmott is a vocal and long-standing critic of the use of mathematical models in finance by quants. In a paper published by the Royal Society in 2000, he stated that \"It is clear that a major rethink is desperately required if the world is to avoid a mathematician-led market meltdown\u2026 The underlying assumptions in the models, such as the importance of the normal\ndistribution, the elimination of risk, measurable correlations, etc., are incorrect\".[10]\n In 2008, he expressed his frustration in the lack of progress made in adopting more appropriate models: \"I don't like the assumptions, the models, the implications\u2026 Banks and hedge funds employ mathematicians with no financial-market experience to build models that no one is testing scientifically for use in situations where they were not intended by traders who don\u2019t understand them. And people are surprised by the losses!\"[11]\n Writing six months before the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, he stated: \"I predict that things are going to get even worse\".[12]\n Reflecting his concerns, in 2009 Wilmott and fellow quant Emanuel Derman co-authored the Financial Modelers' Manifesto, which lays out a series of principles for more responsibility in risk management and quantitative finance[13]\n In 2015, Paul posed as a potential donor to the United Kingdom Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties in order to expose wrongdoing in the election. He suggested he was willing to donate \u00a350,000 to each party.  In the course of the investigation he met all three party leaders, met four cabinet ministers and two shadow cabinet ministers.[14]\n In addition to research papers on quantitative finance, Wilmott has authored several textbooks, including:\n ", "tags": ["1959 births", "Living people", "Financial economists", "Alumni of St Catherine's College, Oxford", "Writers who illustrated their own writing", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Paul WilmottPaul Wilmott in 2012Born (1959-11-08) 8 November 1959 (age\u00a061)NationalityBritishAlma\u00a0materSt Catherine's College, Oxford(DPhil, 1985)Occupation\nresearcher\nconsultant\nlecturer\nquantitative analyst\nKnown\u00a0forWilmottwilmott.com\nPaul Wilmott (born 8 November 1959)[1] is an English researcher, consultant and lecturer in quantitative finance.[2] He is best known as the author of various academic and practitioner texts on risk and derivatives,[2] for Wilmott magazine and Wilmott.com, a quantitative finance portal, and for his prescient warnings about the misuse of mathematics in finance.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n3 Criticism of misuse of financial mathematics\n4 Criticism of funding for political parties\n5 Publications\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nOne of two sons of an accountant and an entrepreneurial mother, Wilmott attended grammar school in Birkenhead, and read mathematics at St Catherine's College, Oxford.
