{"name": "James Dyson", "content": "\n Sir James Dyson OM CBE RDI FRS FREng FCSD FIEE (born 2 May 1947) is a British inventor, industrial designer, landowner and entrepreneur who founded Dyson Ltd.[4][5] Traditionally, he is best known as the inventor of the Dual Cyclone bagless vacuum cleaner, which works on the principle of cyclonic separation. According to the Sunday Times Rich List 2020, he is Britain's richest person with an estimated net worth of \u00a316.2 billion.[6] He served as the Provost of the Royal College of Art from August 2011 to July 2017,[7][8] and opened a new University, the Dyson Institute of Engineering and Technology, on Dyson's Wiltshire Campus in September 2017.[9]\n James Dyson was born 2 May 1947 in Cromer, Norfolk, one of three children.[1] He was educated at Gresham's School, an independent boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, from 1956 to 1965, when his father died of prostate cancer.[10] He excelled at long-distance running: \"I was quite good at it, not because I was physically good, but because I had more determination. I learnt determination from it.\"[11] He spent one year (1965\u20131966) at the Byam Shaw School of Art, and then studied furniture and interior design at the Royal College of Art (1966\u20131970) before moving into engineering. It was whilst attending the Royal College of Art[12] to study fine art that Dyson made the switch to industrial design due in part to the tutorage of Anthony Hunt, the renowned structural engineer.\n Dyson helped design the Sea Truck in 1970 while studying at the Royal College of Art. His first original invention, the Ballbarrow, was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel. This was featured on the BBC's Tomorrow's World television programme. Dyson stuck with the idea of a ball, inventing the Trolleyball, a trolley that launched boats. He then designed the Wheelboat,[13] which could travel at speeds of 64 kilometres per hour (40\u00a0mph) on both land and water.\n In the late 1970s, Dyson had the idea of using cyclonic separation to create a vacuum cleaner that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt. He became frustrated with his Hoover Junior's diminishing performance: the dust bag pores kept becoming clogged with dust thus reducing suction.[14] The cyclone idea came from a sawmill that used cyclone technology.[15]\n Partly supported by his wife's salary as an art teacher, and after fifteen years and about 5,127 prototypes, Dyson launched the \"G-Force\" cleaner in 1983.[16] However, no manufacturer or distributor would handle his product in the UK, as it would have disturbed the valuable market for replacement dust bags, so Dyson launched it in Japan through catalogue sales.[17] Manufactured in bright pink, the G-Force sold for the equivalent of \u00a32,000. It won the 1991 International Design Fair Prize in Japan. He filed a series of patents for his dual cyclone vacuum cleaner EP0037674 in 1980.\n After his invention was rejected by the major manufacturers, Dyson set up his own manufacturing company, Dyson Ltd. In June 1993, he opened a research centre and factory in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.\n Dyson's breakthrough in the UK market came more than ten years after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was \u00a3100\u00a0million. The slogan \"say goodbye to the bag\" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag\u00a0\u2013 users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience.  The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.[18] In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).\n Dyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to Fantom Technologies, after which Dyson entered the market directly.\n Following his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999, Dyson sued Hoover (UK) for patent infringement.  The High Court ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.[19] Hoover agreed to pay damages of \u00a34\u00a0million.\n In 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball.  This ball, rather than the static wheels on existing vacuums, enabled it to become more steerable, which was more useful for navigating around obstacles and corners.\n In mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his \"360 Eye\" robotic vacuum cleaner. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360\u00b0 scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brushroll bar, and user interface via a free iOS or Android app.[20]\n Interviewed by Fast Company (May 2007), Dyson asserted the importance of failure in one's life, \"I made 5,127 prototypes of my vacuum before I got it right. There were 5,126 failures. But I learned from each one. That's how I came up with a solution. So I don't mind failure. I've always thought that schoolchildren should be marked by the number of failures they've had. The child who tries strange things and experiences lots of failures to get there is probably more creative.\"[16]\n In 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a washing machine called the ContraRotator, which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was decorated in the usual bright Dyson colours, rather than the traditional white, grey or black of most other machines. It was not a commercial success, and is no longer available.[21]\n In 2002, Dyson created a realisation of the optical illusions depicted in the lithographs of Dutch artist M. C. Escher. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a water sculpture in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. Called Wrong Garden, it was displayed at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2003.[22] The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.\n In October 2006 Dyson launched the Dyson Airblade, a fast hand dryer that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a squeegee to remove water, rather than attempting to evaporate it with heat. This allows faster drying, while using much less energy than traditional electrical hand dryers.[citation needed]\n Another product, launched on 18 October 2009, is a fan without external blades, which he calls the Air Multiplier.[23] In addition to a cooling fan, a model which distributes electrically produced heat and an ultrasonic humidifier model are also available.\n In April 2016, Dyson launched the Dyson Supersonic, a hair dryer with a smaller motor located in the handle so as to provide better balance and smaller size, as well as quieter operation.[24] Commenting on the launch, Vogue magazine said \"as the first product to launch from Dyson's new UK state-of-the-art hair laboratory, we have high hopes for the future of our blow-dries.\"[25]\n In 2017 Dyson spent \u00a37m a week on research and development of new products.[26] The company is the UK's biggest investor in robotics and artificial intelligence research, employing over 3,500 engineers and scientists, and engaging in more than 40 university research programmes. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Dyson said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at more non-domestic products but we are not rushing to do lots of different things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a private company so we can do it when we are ready.\u201d\n In November 2014, Dyson announced plans to invest a further \u00a31.5bn into the research and development of new technology, including funding for an expanded campus at the Dyson UK headquarters in Malmesbury which will create up to 3,000 jobs.[27]\n The then Prime Minister David Cameron, said: \u201cDyson is a great British success story and the expansion of the Malmesbury campus will create thousands of new jobs, providing a real boost to the local economy and financial security for more hardworking families. Investment on this scale shows confidence in our long-term economic plan to back business, create more jobs and secure a brighter future for Britain.\u201d.[28]\n In March 2016, Dyson announced a second new multimillion-pound research and development centre on a 517-acre former Ministry of Defence (MoD) site at Hullavington, Wiltshire. The company said it aimed to double its UK-based workforce in the next five or six years. Dyson said: \"After 25 years of UK growth, and continuing expansion globally, we are fast outgrowing our Malmesbury Campus. To win in the world stage you have to develop new technology and develop great products and that's what we're doing here.\".[29]\n In September 2017, Dyson announced plans to produce an electric vehicle, aiming to be launched in 2020, investing \u00a32bn of his own money.[30] He assembled a team of more than 400 people for the project.[30] According to reports, the vehicle was intended to be powered by a solid-state battery, Dyson having acquired the battery company Sakti3 in 2015.[31] In October 2019, Dyson announced that the electric car project had been cancelled due to it not being commercially viable.[32]\n In 2017, Dyson launched the Dyson Institute of Engineering and Technology.[9]\n Dyson has several times accused Chinese spies and students of stealing technological and scientific secrets from the UK through the planting of software bugs and by infiltrating British industries, institutions, and universities after they left. He also complained that China benefits from stealing foreign designs, flouting of product copyrights and a two-speed patent system that discriminates against foreign firms with unreasonably longer times.[33][34][35][36]\n In 1998, Dyson was one of the chairmen and chief executives of 20 FTSE 100 companies who signed a statement published in The Financial Times calling on the government for early British membership of the Eurozone.[37] He claimed that failure to join the euro would lead to the destruction of the British manufacturing base and said: \"It does not mean that the jobs will go tomorrow but will drift abroad over a period and the longer-term future of Britain as a manufacturing nation will be blighted. Ministers had better understand that if we delay entry too long there may be nothing left to save.\"[38]\n Claiming that the strength of the pound was affecting his company's profits on exports to France and Germany, in February 2000 Dyson threatened to shift focus from his Malmesbury plant to a new plant set up in Malaysia because the government would not join the euro. He said: \"We would expect to double in size in the next two years. We are talking about a \u00a3100 million investment and up to 2,000 jobs. I would like to make that investment in the UK. But it seems that is not going to be possible. The value of sterling means we are struggling to compete at home with cheap imports from Europe and the Far East. We do around \u00a340 million worth of export business with France and Germany each year but we aren't making any money. If we joined the euro we would be on an even footing with our biggest trading partners.\"[39] An editorial published in The Times responded: \"Mr Dyson, a manufacturing version of Sir Richard Branson, likes complaining. Yesterday he was complaining that Britain's failure to join the euro and the resultant strong pound will force him to move abroad. Last week he blamed the price of land and planning delays in Wiltshire, but never mind. So where will he go? To Portugal, Italy or to an EU candidate such as Poland? No, Mr Dyson threatens to go to the Far East. Like so many entrepreneurs, he wants a cheap currency and low interest rates, but also low inflation, low wages, a flexible labour market and low regulation. He will not find them in the eurozone.\"[40]\n Dyson again threatened to shift production abroad in November 2000, saying: \"It's suicidal for the UK not to join the euro. Why should we go on exporting at a loss? We're facing unfair competition.\"[41][42] In February 2002, Dyson announced that production was finally being shifted to the Far East. In August 2003, assembly of washing machines was also switched from Malmesbury to Malaysia.[43]\n Dyson was one of the most prominent UK business leaders to publicly support Brexit before the referendum in June 2016.[44] Since the EU referendum, Dyson has stated that Britain should leave the EU Single Market and that this would \"liberate\" the economy and allow Britain to strike its own trade deals around the world.[45] During 2016, 19% of Dyson Ltd exports went to EU countries (at WTO tariffs), compared with 81% to non-EU countries.[46] In 2017, Dyson suggested that the UK should leave the EU without an interim deal and that \"uncertainty is an opportunity\".[47] Previously, in 2014, Dyson had said he would be voting to leave the European Union to avoid being \"dominated and bullied by the Germans\".[48] In November 2017, Dyson was critical of the UK government Brexit negotiations and said \"we should just walk away and they will come to us\".[49] After it became public in January 2019, that Dyson's company was to move its headquarters from Malmesbury to Singapore, he was accused of hypocrisy regarding his campaign for Brexit.[50]\n In November 2015, Dyson lost his case against EU energy labelling laws in the European General Court,[51] however a subsequent appeal in the European Court of Justice said that the previous ruling had \u201cdistorted the facts\u201d and \u201cerred in law\u201d.[52]\n Dyson set up the James Dyson Foundation in 2002 to support design and engineering education; it now operates in UK, US and Japan. The foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes.  The foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the \"Engineering Box\", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for Key Stage 4 and above.  The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of Genius of Britain, a Channel 4 TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.\n In May 2014, the foundation announced an \u00a38m donation to create a technology hub at the University of Cambridge. A new four-storey building will house 1,200 postgraduate engineers and support world-leading research. The donation will also allow for a design and making lab to be developed for undergraduate engineering students.[53]\n In March 2015, the foundation pledged a \u00a312m donation to Imperial College London to allow the purchase of a Post Office building in Exhibition Road from the Science Museum. Imperial College will open the Dyson School of Design Engineering in this building, and teach a new four-year master's degree in design engineering.[54]\n The foundation also supports the work of young designers through the James Dyson Award, an international design award that \"celebrates, encourages and inspires the next generation of design engineers\".[55] It is run in 20 countries and is open to recent graduates in product design, industrial design and engineering.\n In June 2019, the foundation announced a donation of \u00a318.75 million to Dyson's old school, Gresham's, for the building of a new science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) building.[56]\n Dyson married Deirdre Hindmarsh in 1968.[1] They have three children; two sons and a daughter.[1]\nIn 2003, Dyson paid \u00a315\u00a0million[citation needed] for Dodington Park,[69] a 300-acre (1.2\u00a0km2) Georgian estate in South Gloucestershire close to Chipping Sodbury. He and his wife own Domaine des Rabelles, near Tourtour, France, and a house in Chelsea, London.[citation needed] His vessel Nahlin is the largest British-flagged and owned super yacht with an overall length of 91 metres (299\u00a0ft), and was ranked 36th in a 2013 survey of the world's 100 biggest yachts.[70][71]\n In July 2019, Dyson spent \u00a343 million on a 21,108 square foot (1,961.0\u00a0m2) triplex flat at the top of the Guoco Tower, the tallest building in Singapore.[72][73] He later sold the flat in October 2020 for \u00a336 million.[74][75] \nDyson has also invested heavily into buying agriculture lands across Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire, and Gloucestershire.[76]\n \"All text published under the heading 'Biography' on Fellow profile pages is available under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\" --\"Royal Society Terms, conditions and policies\".

Ministers had better understand that if we delay entry too long there may be nothing left to save.\"[38]\nClaiming that the strength of the pound was affecting his company's profits on exports to France and Germany, in February 2000 Dyson threatened to shift focus from his Malmesbury plant to a new plant set up in Malaysia because the government would not join the euro. He said: \"We would expect to double in size in the next two years. We are talking about a \u00a3100 million investment and up to 2,000 jobs. I would like to make that investment in the UK. But it seems that is not going to be possible. The value of sterling means we are struggling to compete at home with cheap imports from Europe and the Far East. We do around \u00a340 million worth of export business with France and Germany each year but we aren't making any money. If we joined the euro we would be on an even footing with our biggest trading partners.\"[39] An editorial published in The Times responded: \"Mr Dyson, a manufacturing version of Sir Richard Branson, likes complaining. Yesterday he was complaining that Britain's failure to join the euro and the resultant strong pound will force him to move abroad. Last week he blamed the price of land and planning delays in Wiltshire, but never mind. So where will he go? To Portugal, Italy or to an EU candidate such as Poland? No, Mr Dyson threatens to go to the Far East. Like so many entrepreneurs, he wants a cheap currency and low interest rates, but also low inflation, low wages, a flexible labour market and low regulation. He will not find them in the eurozone.\"[40]\nDyson again threatened to shift production abroad in November 2000, saying: \"It's suicidal for the UK not to join the euro. Why should we go on exporting at a loss? We're facing unfair competition.\"[41][42] In February 2002, Dyson announced that production was finally being shifted to the Far East. In August 2003, assembly of washing machines was also switched from Malmesbury to Malaysia.[43]\n\nPro-Brexit[edit]\nDyson was one of the most prominent UK business leaders to publicly support Brexit before the referendum in June 2016.[44] Since the EU referendum, Dyson has stated that Britain should leave the EU Single Market and that this would \"liberate\" the economy and allow Britain to strike its own trade deals around the world.[45] During 2016, 19% of Dyson Ltd exports went to EU countries (at WTO tariffs), compared with 81% to non-EU countries.[46] In 2017, Dyson suggested that the UK should leave the EU without an interim deal and that \"uncertainty is an opportunity\".[47] Previously, in 2014, Dyson had said he would be voting to leave the European Union to avoid being \"dominated and bullied by the Germans\".[48] In November 2017, Dyson was critical of the UK government Brexit negotiations and said \"we should just walk away and they will come to us\".[49] After it became public in January 2019, that Dyson's company was to move its headquarters from Malmesbury to Singapore, he was accused of hypocrisy regarding his campaign for Brexit.[50]\n\nEuropean Court of Justice[edit]\nIn November 2015, Dyson lost his case against EU energy labelling laws in the European General Court,[51] however a subsequent appeal in the European Court of Justice said that the previous ruling had \u201cdistorted the facts\u201d and \u201cerred in law\u201d.[52]\n\nJames Dyson Foundation[edit]\n Dyson in 2013 while visiting Sydney, Australia\nDyson set up the James Dyson Foundation in 2002 to support design and engineering education; it now operates in UK, US and Japan. The foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes.  The foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the \"Engineering Box\", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for Key Stage 4 and above.  The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of Genius of Britain, a Channel 4 TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.\nIn May 2014, the foundation announced an \u00a38m donation to create a technology hub at the University of Cambridge. A new four-storey building will house 1,200 postgraduate engineers and support world-leading research. The donation will also allow for a design and making lab to be developed for undergraduate engineering students.[53]\nIn March 2015, the foundation pledged a \u00a312m donation to Imperial College London to allow the purchase of a Post Office building in Exhibition Road from the Science Museum. Imperial College will open the Dyson School of Design Engineering in this building, and teach a new four-year master's degree in design engineering.[54]\nThe foundation also supports the work of young designers through the James Dyson Award, an international design award that \"celebrates, encourages and inspires the next generation of design engineers\".[55] It is run in 20 countries and is open to recent graduates in product design, industrial design and engineering.\nIn June 2019, the foundation announced a donation of \u00a318.75 million to Dyson's old school, Gresham's, for the building of a new science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) building.[56]\n\nHonours and awards[edit]\nIn 1997 Dyson was awarded the Prince Philip Designers Prize.[57]\nDyson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1998 New Year Honours for services to industrial design.[58]\nIn 2000, he received the Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran Award.\nHe received an honorary doctorate from the University of Bath in 2000.[59]\nIn 2005 Dyson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng)[60] and appointed a Royal Designer for Industry.[61]\nDyson was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 2007 New Year Honours for services to business.[62]\nDyson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2015.[3]\nDyson was appointed to the Order of Merit (OM) in the 2016 New Year Honours for achievements in industrial design.[63][64]\nIn 2017 Dyson was awarded IEEE Honorary Membership.\nDyson was provost of the Royal College of Art in London until 1 July 2017, having succeeded Sir Terence Conran in August 2011,[65] and is patron of the Design & Technology Association.[66]\nHe was chair of the board of trustees of the Design Museum, \"the first in the world to showcase design of the manufactured object\", until suddenly resigning in September 2004,[67] saying the museum had \"become a style showcase\" instead of \"upholding its mission to encourage serious design of the manufactured object\".\nIn February 2019 Dyson was elected a foreign member of the United States National Academy of Engineering.[68]\nPersonal life[edit]\nDyson married Deirdre Hindmarsh in 1968.[1] They have three children; two sons and a daughter.[1]\nIn 2003, Dyson paid \u00a315\u00a0million[citation needed] for Dodington Park,[69] a 300-acre (1.2\u00a0km2) Georgian estate in South Gloucestershire close to Chipping Sodbury. He and his wife own Domaine des Rabelles, near Tourtour, France, and a house in Chelsea, London.[citation needed] His vessel Nahlin is the largest British-flagged and owned super yacht with an overall length of 91 metres (299\u00a0ft), and was ranked 36th in a 2013 survey of the world's 100 biggest yachts.[70][71]\nIn July 2019, Dyson spent \u00a343 million on a 21,108 square foot (1,961.0\u00a0m2) triplex flat at the top of the Guoco Tower, the tallest building in Singapore.[72][73] He later sold the flat in October 2020 for \u00a336 million.[74][75] \nDyson has also invested heavily into buying agriculture lands across Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire, and Gloucestershire.[76]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d \"DYSON, James\".
