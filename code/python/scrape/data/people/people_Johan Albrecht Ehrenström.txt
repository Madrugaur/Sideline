{"name": "Johan Albrecht Ehrenstr\u00f6m", "content": "Johan Albrecht Ehrenstr\u00f6m (28 August 1762 \u2013 15 April 1847) was a notable Finnish politician and official who is best remembered as the designer of Helsinki city plan.[1][2]\n Ehrenstr\u00f6m was a resident of what would later become Finland, in the eastern parts of the Swedish Kingdom. Following the Swedish defeat in the Finnish War in 1809, the region became a part of the Russian Empire, and the city of Helsinki was promoted to be the new capital of the new Grand Duchy of Finland. Ehrenstr\u00f6m was selected to be the chairman of the committee in charge of rebuilding the city of Helsinki after a fire that destroyed many of its old wooden structures in 1808.[1]\n In contrast to the old medieval-style city plan with narrow and winding alleys, Ehrenstr\u00f6m's vision for Helsinki was one of wide streets placed on a geometric grid in the fashion of the cities of ancient Greece. This plan was eventually approved by Tsar Alexander I of Russia, Grand Duke of Finland, and the city redesigned, led by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel. After the city of Oulu was devastated by fire in 1822, Ehrenstr\u00f6m was tasked with drawing a new plan for it. This was finished in 1824 and ratified by the Tsar the following year.[3]\n Johan Fredrik Aminoff\u00a0[fi], Johan Albrecht Ehrenstr\u00f6m and Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, painting by Ren\u00e9 Th\u00e9odore Berthon, 1803\n Ehrenst\u00f6m's final plan for the city, 30 June 1817\n ", "tags": ["1762 births", "1847 deaths", "Finnish senators", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Johan Albrecht Ehrenstr\u00f6mPortrait by Johan Erik Lindh, 1839Born(1762-08-28)28 August 1762Helsinki, Sweden (now Finland)Died15 April 1847(1847-04-15) (aged\u00a084)Helsinki, Grand Duchy of Finland, Russian EmpireNationalityFinnish\nJohan Albrecht Ehrenstr\u00f6m (28 August 1762 \u2013 15 April 1847) was a notable Finnish politician and official who is best remembered as the designer of Helsinki city plan.[1][2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Gallery\n3 References\n4 Other Source\n5 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nEhrenstr\u00f6m was a resident of what would later become Finland, in the eastern parts of the Swedish Kingdom.
