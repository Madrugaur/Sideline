{"name": "Rochelle Gutierrez", "content": "Rochelle Gutierrez is a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign.[1] Her main focus is changing the way in which mathematics is taught to the minority and the effects of race, class and language on teaching and learning.[1][2]\n Gutierrez is from San Jose, California. She attended Stanford University and received her bachelor\u2019s degree in human biology in 1990. She then moved to the University of Chicago, where she earned a master\u2019s degree in social sciences and a PhD in education. Her doctoral research was centered on equity in teaching mathematics.[1]\n Gutierrez has been working at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign since 1996. Her main focus is on how intersectionality can play a role when learning mathematics. Some of her research is based on how to better teach underprivileged students mathematics and how teachers and professors can better assist the students.[3][2] Gutierrez has also researched how mathematics can have an impact in a student's place in society and power. On a website, Campus Reform, she is quoted as saying, \"On many levels, mathematics itself operates as Whiteness. Who gets credit for doing and developing mathematics, who is capable in mathematics, and who is seen as part of the mathematical community is generally viewed as White\".[4] Gutierrez challenges the way in which the education system is teaching mathematics and is changing the way in which minorities can better learn and be successful in the field so that they can rise to the challenge of a white viewed area.\n In 2010 she was given the Outstanding Faculty Award for Service at UIUC.[1]\n In 2011 Gutierrez received the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators award, which is an organization who recognize teachers who are dedicated in improving Mathematical education.[1][5]\n In 2016 she was awarded the Iris M.
