She also helped her father's research between 1919 and 1921 at the University College Wales in Aberystwyth, and worked with Edward Collingwood, also of Aberystwyth, on a translation of Georges Valiron's course on Integral Functions.[3] She received a L-\u00c9s-sc (a bachelor's degree) from Lausanne in 1925.[4]\n She then studied at Girton College, Cambridge, gaining a PhD in 1929 under the supervision of Professor E. W. Hobson[5] for research on Stieltjes integration. She accepted a teaching post at Imperial College, London where she worked until 1967.[3]\n After 1936, most of her research was in the history of mathematics, and she had a particular interest in Thomas Harriot, an Elizabethan mathematician. She set up the Harriot Seminars in Oxford and Durham. Rosalind married William Tanner in 1953; however, he died a few months after their marriage. Her interest in sixteenth and seventeenth century mathematics continued after her retirement, and she died on 24 November 1992.[3]\n ", "tags": ["1900 births", "1992 deaths", "Historians of mathematics", "20th-century British mathematicians", "20th-century historians", "20th-century women mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "German historian of mathematics\nRosalind TannerMrs. R.
