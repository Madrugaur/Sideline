{"name": "Chuck Hull", "content": "\n Chuck Hull (Charles W. Hull; born May 12, 1939) is the co-founder, executive vice president and chief technology officer of 3D Systems.[1][2] He is one of the inventors of the SLA 3D printer, the first commercial rapid prototyping technology, and the widely used STL file format. He is named on more than 60 U.S. patents as well as other patents around the world in the fields of ion optics and rapid prototyping.  He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014[3] and in 2017 was one of the first inductees into the TCT Hall of Fame.[4]\n Chuck Hull was born on May 12, 1939 in Clifton, Colorado, the son of Lester and Esther Hull.  His early life was spent in Clifton and Gateway, Colorado.  He graduated from Central High School in Grand Junction, Colorado.  Chuck received a BS in engineering physics from the University of Colorado in 1961.[5]\n Hull first came up with the idea in 1983 when he was using UV light to harden tabletop coatings.[6] But on July 16, 1984 Alain Le M\u00e9haut\u00e9, Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude Andr\u00e9 filed their patent for the stereolithography process.[7] It was three weeks before Chuck Hull filed his own patent for stereolithography. The application of French inventors were abandoned by the French General Electric Company (now Alcatel-Alsthom) and CILAS (The Laser Consortium).[8] The claimed reason was \u201cfor lack of business perspective\u201d.[9] Hull coined the term \u201cstereolithography\u201d in his U.S. Patent 4,575,330 entitled \u201cApparatus for Production of Three-Dimensional Objects by Stereolithography\u201d issued on March 11, 1986.[10] He defined stereolithography as a method and apparatus for making solid objects by successively \u201cprinting\u201d thin layers of the ultraviolet curable material one on top of the other. \nIn Hull's patent, a concentrated beam of ultraviolet light is focused onto the surface of a vat filled with liquid photopolymer. The light beam, moving under computer control, draws each layer of the object onto the surface of the liquid. Wherever the beam strikes the surface, the photopolymer polymerizes/crosslinks and changes to a solid. An advanced CAD/CAM/CAE software mathematically slices the computer model of the object into a large number of thin layers. The process then builds the object layer by layer starting with the bottom layer, on an elevator that is lowered slightly after solidification of each layer. \n[11]\n In 1986, commercial rapid prototyping was started by Hull when he founded 3D Systems in Valencia, California.[12] Hull realized that his concept was not limited to liquids and therefore gave it the generic name \u201cstereolithography\u201d (3D printing),[13] and filed broad patent claims covering any \u201cmaterial capable of solidification\u201d or \u201cmaterial capable of altering its physical state.\u201d\n Hull built up a patent portfolio covering many fundamental aspects of today's additive manufacturing technologies such as data preparation via triangulated models (STL file format) and slicing, and exposure strategies such as alternating hatch directions.\n[14]\n The salary for his role as 3D Systems CTO was $307,500 in 2011.[15]\n ", "tags": ["1939 births", "Living people", "21st-century American engineers", "University of Colorado alumni", "American chief technology officers", "Wikipedia pending changes protected pages", "Articles with hCards", "No local image but image on Wikidata", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "This article is about the inventor of the SLA 3D printer.
