Most of his academic life, from 1912 to 1938, was spent at the University of Vienna, where he taught for example Kurt G\u00f6del, who later said that Furtw\u00e4ngler's lectures on number theory were the best mathematical lectures that he ever heard; G\u00f6del had originally intended to become a physicist but turned to mathematics partly as a result of Furtw\u00e4ngler's lectures. Furtw\u00e4ngler was paralysed and, without notes, lectured from a wheelchair while his assistant wrote equations on the blackboard.[1]\n Some of Furtw\u00e4ngler's doctoral students were Wolfgang Gr\u00f6bner, Nikolaus Hofreiter, Henry Mann, Otto Schreier, and Olga Taussky-Todd.
