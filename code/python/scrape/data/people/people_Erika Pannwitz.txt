She studied mathematics in Berlin, and also for a semester in Freiburg (1925) and G\u00f6ttingen (1928).  After passing her teaching exam in 1927 (in mathematics, physics, and chemistry), Pannwitz was promoted in 1931 to Dr Phil at Friedrich Wilhelms University with doctoral advisors Heinz Hopf and Erhard Schmidt.[4] Her thesis titled: Eine elementargeometrische Eigenschaft von Verschlingungen und Knoten (An elementary geometric property of entanglements and knots), which appeared two years later in the prestigious journal Mathematische Annalen, was honored opus eximium being considered an outstanding thesis.

Both doctoral advisors wrote extraordinary statements about the thesis. Hopf in particular wrote eight pages of comments and left a summary quoted below:\n\nThe author has thus completely solved a difficult concrete problem that has been posed by completely independent investigations; It has achieved this goal by an expedient choice of new concepts, by understanding and profound insight into the difficult material presented to it, by the mastery of older methods and their new uses, and thus proving their scientific maturity in this first essay.\nSince, in my judgment, both the objective scientific value of this work and the subjective performance it achieves exceed the level of good dissertations, I ask the faculty to accept the dissertation submitted by Miss Pannwitz as \"eximium\".[5]\nSchmidt also wrote an extraordinary statement on the thesis:\n\nI agree with the vote of Mr. Hopf. The topology is one of the most promising yet at the same time most difficult areas of mathematics, because the methodological-technical apparatus is still so in the beginning, that every valuable result can be achieved only with a high mass of strong ingenuity. The present work has enriched the topology with a series of extraordinarily beautiful sentences[5]\nIn her thesis, she established that every piecewise linear knot in general position (other than the unknot) has a quadrisecant, i.e., four collinear points.
