{"name": "Arieh Iserles", "content": "\n Arieh Iserles (born 2 September 1947) is a computational mathematician, currently Professor of the Numerical Analysis of Differential Equations at the University of Cambridge and a member of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.\n He studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and wrote his PhD dissertation on numerical methods for stiff ordinary differential equations. His research comprises many themes in computational and applied mathematics: ordinary and partial differential equations, approximation theory, geometric numerical integration, orthogonal polynomials, functional equations, computational dynamics and the computation of highly oscillatory phenomena.\n He has written a textbook, A First Course in the Numerical Analysis of Differential Equations (Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed. 2009).[1]\n Arieh Iserles is the Managing Editor of Acta Numerica, Editor-in-Chief of IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis[2] and an editor of several other mathematical journals.
