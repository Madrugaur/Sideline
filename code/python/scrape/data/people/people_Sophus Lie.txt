{"name": "Sophus Lie", "content": "\n Marius Sophus Lie (/li\u02d0/ LEE; Norwegian:\u00a0[li\u02d0]; 17 December 1842 \u2013 18 February 1899) was a Norwegian mathematician.  He largely created the theory of continuous symmetry and applied it to the study of geometry and differential equations.\n His first mathematical work, Repr\u00e4sentation der Imagin\u00e4ren der Plangeometrie, was published in 1869 by the Academy of Sciences in Christiania and also by Crelle's Journal. That same year he received a scholarship and traveled to Berlin, where he stayed from September to February 1870. There, he met Felix Klein and they became close friends. When he left Berlin, Lie traveled to Paris, where he was joined by Klein two months later. There, they met Camille Jordan and Gaston Darboux. But on 19 July 1870 the Franco-Prussian War began and Klein (who was Prussian) had to leave France very quickly. Lie left for Fontainebleau where after a while he was arrested under suspicion of being a German spy, an event that made him famous in Norway. He was released from prison after a month, thanks to the intervention of Darboux.[1]\n Lie obtained his PhD at the University of Christiania (present day Oslo) in 1871 with a thesis entitled Over en Classe geometriske Transformationer (On a Class of Geometric Transformations).[2]\n It would be described by Darboux as \"one of the most handsome discoveries of modern Geometry\". The next year, the Norwegian Parliament established an extraordinary professorship for him. That same year, Lie visited Klein, who was then at Erlangen and working on the Erlangen program.\n In 1872 Lie spent eight years together with Peter Ludwig Mejdell Sylow, editing and publishing the mathematical works of their countryman, Niels Henrik Abel.\n At the end of 1872, Sophus Lie proposed to Anna Birch, then eighteen years old, and they were married in 1874. The couple had three children: Marie (b. 1877), Dagny (b. 1880) and Herman (b. 1884).\n In 1884, Friedrich Engel arrived at Christiania to help him, with the support of Klein and Adolph Mayer (who were both professors at Leipzig, by then). Engel would help Lie to write his most important treatise, Theorie der Transformationsgruppen, published in Leipzig in three volumes from 1888 to 1893. Decades later, Engel would also be one of the two editors of Lie's collected works.\n In 1886 Lie became professor at Leipzig, replacing Klein, who had moved to G\u00f6ttingen. In November 1889, Lie suffered a mental breakdown and had to be hospitalized until June 1890. After that, he returned to his post, but over the years his anaemia progressed to the point where he decided to return to his homeland. Consequently, in 1898 he tendered his resignation in May, and left for home (for good) in September the same year. He died the following year, 1899.\n He was made Honorary Member of the London Mathematical Society in 1878, Member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1892, Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London in 1895 and foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America in 1895.\n Sophus Lie died at the age of 56, due to pernicious anemia, a disease caused by impaired absorption of vitamin B12.\n Lie's principal tool, and one of his greatest achievements, was the discovery that continuous transformation groups (now called, after him, Lie groups) could be better understood by \"linearizing\" them, and studying the corresponding generating vector fields (the so-called infinitesimal generators). The generators are subject to a linearized version of the group law, now called the commutator bracket, and have the structure of what is today called a Lie algebra.[3][4]\n Hermann Weyl used Lie's work on group theory in his papers from 1922 and 1923, and Lie groups today play a role in quantum mechanics.[4]\nHowever, the subject of Lie groups as it is studied today is vastly different from what the research by Sophus Lie was about and \"among the 19th century masters, Lie's work is in detail certainly the least known today\".[5]\n Sophus Lie was an eager proponent in the establishment of the Abel Prize. Inspired by the Nansen fund named after Fridtjof Nansen, and the lack of a prize for mathematics in the Nobel Prize. He gathered support for the establishment of an award for outstanding work in pure mathematics.[6]\n Lie advised many doctoral students who went on to become successful mathematicians. \u00c9lie Cartan became widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. Kazimierz \u017borawski's work was proved to be of importance to a variety of fields. Hans Frederick Blichfeldt made great contributions to various fields of mathematics.\n ", "tags": ["1842 births", "1899 deaths", "People from Eid, Norway", "19th-century mathematicians", "Norwegian mathematicians", "Group theorists", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences", "University of Oslo alumni", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences", "Leipzig University faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from September 2020", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Norwegian mathematician\n\n\nSophus LieBorn(1842-12-17)17 December 1842Nordfjordeid, NorwayDied18 February 1899(1899-02-18) (aged\u00a056)Kristiania, NorwayNationalityNorwegianAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ChristianiaKnown\u00a0forOne-parameter groupSee full listAwardsLobachevsky Medal (1897)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsUniversity of ChristianiaUniversity of LeipzigDoctoral advisorCarl Anton BjerknesCato Maximilian GuldbergDoctoral studentsHans BlichfeldtLucjan Emil B\u00f6ttcherGerhard KowalewskiKazimierz \u017borawski\u00c9lie CartanElling Holst\n\nMarius Sophus Lie (/li\u02d0/ LEE; Norwegian:\u00a0[li\u02d0]; 17 December 1842 \u2013 18 February 1899) was a Norwegian mathematician.
