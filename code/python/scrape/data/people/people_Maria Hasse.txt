{"name": "Maria Hasse", "content": "Maria-Viktoria Hasse (May 30, 1921 \u2013 January 10, 2014) was a German mathematician who became the first female professor in the faculty of mathematics and science at TU Dresden.[1] She wrote books on set theory and category theory,[2] and is known as one of the namesakes of the Gallai\u2013Hasse\u2013Roy\u2013Vitaver theorem in graph coloring.\n Hasse was born in Warnem\u00fcnde. She went to the gymnasium in Rostock, and after a term in the Reich Labour Service from 1939 to 1940, studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at the University of Rostock and University of T\u00fcbingen from 1940 to 1943, earning a diploma in 1943 from Rostock.
