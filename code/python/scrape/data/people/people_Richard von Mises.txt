{"name": "Richard von Mises", "content": "Richard Edler von Mises[1] (German: [f\u0254n \u02c8mi\u02d0z\u0259s]; 19 April 1883 \u2013 14 July 1953) was an Austrian Jewish scientist and mathematician who worked on solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, aeronautics, statistics and probability theory. He held the position of Gordon McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics at Harvard University. He described his work in his own words shortly before his death as being on\n Although best known for his mathematical work, Mises also contributed to the philosophy of science as a neo-positivist, following the line of Ernst Mach. Historians of the Vienna Circle of logical empiricism recognize a \"first phase\" from 1907 through 1914 with  Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn, and Otto Neurath.[citation needed] His older brother, Ludwig von Mises, held an opposite point of view with respect to positivism and epistemology.[3]\n During his time in Istanbul, Mises maintained close contact with Philipp Frank,[4] a logical positivist and Professor of Physics in Prague until 1938. His literary interests included the Austrian novelist Robert Musil and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, on whom he became a recognized expert.[5]\n Richard von Mises was born in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary (now Lviv, Ukraine) into a Jewish family, eighteen months after his brother Ludwig von Mises, who later became a prominent economist of the Austrian School. His parents were Arthur Edler von Mises, a doctor of technical sciences who worked as an expert for the Austrian State Railways, and Adele Landau. Richard and Ludwig also had a younger brother, who died as an infant. Richard attended the Akademisches Gymnasium in Vienna, from which he graduated with honors in Latin and mathematics in autumn 1901. After graduating in mathematics, physics and engineering from the Vienna University of Technology, he was appointed as Georg Hamel's assistant in Br\u00fcnn (now Brno). In 1905, still a student, he published an article on the geometry of curves called \"Zur konstruktiven Infinitesimalgeometrie der ebenen Kurven,\" in the prestigious Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik.\n In 1908 Mises was awarded a doctorate from Vienna (his dissertation was on \"the determination of flywheel masses in crank drives\") and he received his habilitation from Br\u00fcnn (now Brno) (on \"Theory of the Waterwheels\") to lecture on engineering. In 1909, at 26, he was appointed professor of applied mathematics in Stra\u00dfburg, then part of the German Empire (now Strasbourg, Alsace, France) and received Prussian citizenship. His application for a teaching position at the Brno University of Technology was interrupted by the First World War.\n Before the war he had already become a pilot and lectured on the design of aircraft, and in 1913 at Strasbourg he gave the first university course on powered flight. On the outbreak of war it was natural for him to join the Austro-Hungarian army as a test pilot and a flying instructor. In 1915, he supervised the construction of a 600-horsepower (450 kW) aircraft \u2013 the \"Mises-Flugzeug\" (Mises aircraft) for the Austrian army. It was completed in 1916 but never saw active war service.\n After the war, Mises held the new chair of hydrodynamics and aerodynamics at the Dresden Technische Hochschule. In 1919 he was appointed director (and full professor) at the new Institute of Applied Mathematics created at the behest of Erhard Schmidt at the University of Berlin. In 1921 he founded the journal Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik and became its editor.[6]\n With the rise of the National Socialist Party to power in 1933, Mises felt his position threatened,[citation needed] despite his First World War military service. He moved to Turkey, where he held the newly created chair of Pure and Applied Mathematics at the University of Istanbul. In 1939 he accepted a position in the United States, where in 1944 he was appointed as Gordon McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics at Harvard University. In 1943 he married Hilda Geiringer, a mathematician who had been his assistant at the Institute and moved with him to Turkey and then to the U.S.\n In 1950 Mises declined an offer of honorary membership from the Communist-dominated East German Academy of Science.\n In aerodynamics, von Mises made notable advances in boundary-layer-flow theory and airfoil design. He developed the distortion energy theory of stress, which is one of the most important concepts used by engineers in material strength calculations.\n His ideas were not unanimously well received, although Alexander Ostrowski had said of him: \"Only with the appointment of Richard von Mises to the University of Berlin did the first serious German school of applied mathematics with a broad sphere of influence come into existence. Von Mises was an incredibly dynamic person and at the same time amazingly versatile like Runge. He was especially well versed in the realm of technology.\" and also wrote \"Because of his dynamic personality his occasional major blunders were somehow tolerated. One has even forgiven him his theory of probability.\" Yet Andrey Kolmogorov, whose rival axiomatisation was better received, was less severe: \"The basis for the applicability of the results of the mathematical theory of probability to real 'random phenomena' must depend on some form of the frequency concept of probability, the unavoidable nature of which has been established by von Mises in a spirited manner.\"\n In solid mechanics, von Mises made an important contribution to the theory of plasticity by formulating what has become known as the von Mises yield criterion, independently of Tytus Maksymilian Huber.\n He is also often credited for the Principle of Maximum Plastic Dissipation.\n The Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik[7] (International Association of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics) has awarded a Richard von Mises-Preis[8] (Prize) since 1989.\n In probability theory, he was the person who originally proposed the now famous \"birthday problem\".[9] He also defined the impossibility of a gambling system.[10][11]\n \n ", "tags": ["1883 births", "1953 deaths", "Scientists from Lviv", "Jewish emigrants from Austria to the United States after the Anschluss", "Jews from Galicia (Eastern Europe)", "Polish Jews", "Austrian mathematicians", "Austrian physicists", "Edlers of Austria", "Logical positivism", "Vienna Circle", "Istanbul University faculty", "Harvard University faculty", "Fluid dynamicists", "Aerodynamicists", "Probability theorists", "TU Wien alumni", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Articles containing German-language text", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2007", "Articles with unsourced statements from May 2012", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Use dmy dates from April 2017"], "raw": "Austrian physicist and mathematician\nThis article is about the statistician.

It is translated as a noble (one). Before the August 1919 abolition of nobility as a legal class, titles preceded the full name when given (Graf Helmuth James von Moltke). Since 1919, these titles, along with any nobiliary prefix (von, zu, etc.), can be used, but are regarded as a dependent part of the surname, and thus come after any given names (Helmuth James Graf von Moltke). Titles and all dependent parts of surnames are ignored in alphabetical sorting. The feminine form is Edle.\n\n^ Norman L. Johnson; Samuel Kotz (26 September 2011).
