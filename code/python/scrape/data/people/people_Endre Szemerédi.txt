{"name": "Endre Szemer\u00e9di", "content": "\n Endre Szemer\u00e9di (Hungarian:\u00a0[\u02c8\u025bndr\u025b \u02c8s\u025bm\u025bre\u02d0di]; born August 21, 1940) is a Hungarian-American[1] mathematician and computer scientist, working in the field of combinatorics and theoretical computer science. He has been the State of New Jersey Professor of computer science at Rutgers University since 1986. He also holds a professor emeritus status at the Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\n Szemer\u00e9di has won prizes in mathematics and science, including the Abel Prize in 2012. He has made a number of discoveries in combinatorics and computer science, including Szemer\u00e9di's theorem, the Szemer\u00e9di regularity lemma, the Erd\u0151s\u2013Szemer\u00e9di theorem, the Hajnal\u2013Szemer\u00e9di theorem and the Szemer\u00e9di\u2013Trotter theorem.\n Szemer\u00e9di was born in Budapest. Since his parents wished him to become a doctor, Szemer\u00e9di enrolled at a college of medicine, but he dropped out after six months (in an interview[2] he explained it: \"I was not sure I could do work bearing such responsibility.\").[3][4][5] He studied in E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest and received his PhD from Moscow State University. His adviser was Israel Gelfand.[6] This stemmed from a misspelling, as Szemer\u00e9di originally wanted to study with Alexander Gelfond.[3]\n Szemer\u00e9di has been the State of New Jersey Professor of computer science at Rutgers University since 1986. He has held visiting positions at Stanford University (1974), McGill University (1980), the University of South Carolina (1981\u20131983) and the University of Chicago (1985\u20131986).\n Endre Szemer\u00e9di has published over 200 scientific articles in the fields of discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, arithmetic combinatorics and discrete geometry. He is best known for his proof from 1975 of an old conjecture of Paul Erd\u0151s and P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n: if a sequence of natural numbers has positive upper density then it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. This is now known as Szemer\u00e9di's theorem. One of the lemmas introduced in his proof is now known as the Szemer\u00e9di regularity lemma, which has become an important lemma in combinatorics, being used for instance in property testing for graphs and in the theory of graph limits.\n He is also known for the Szemer\u00e9di\u2013Trotter theorem in incidence geometry and the Hajnal\u2013Szemer\u00e9di theorem and Ruzsa\u2013Szemer\u00e9di problem in graph theory. Mikl\u00f3s Ajtai and Szemer\u00e9di proved the corners theorem, an important step toward higher-dimensional generalizations of the Szemer\u00e9di theorem. With Ajtai and J\u00e1nos Koml\u00f3s he proved the ct2/log t upper bound for the Ramsey number R(3,t), and constructed a sorting network of optimal depth. With Ajtai, V\u00e1clav Chv\u00e1tal, and Monroe M. Newborn, Szemer\u00e9di proved the famous Crossing Lemma, that a graph with n vertices and m edges, where m > 4n has at least m3 / 64n2 crossings.  With Paul Erd\u0151s, he proved the Erd\u0151s\u2013Szemer\u00e9di theorem on the number of sums and products in a finite set. With Wolfgang Paul, Nick Pippenger, and William Trotter, he established a separation between nondeterministic linear time and deterministic linear time, in the spirit of the infamous P versus NP problem.\n Szemer\u00e9di has won numerous awards and honors for his contribution to mathematics and computer science. A few of them are listed here:\n Szemer\u00e9di is a corresponding member (1982), and member (1987) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and a member (2010) of the National Academy of Sciences. He is also a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey and a permanent research fellow at the Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics in Budapest.  He was the Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at the California Institute of Technology in 1987\u201388.\nHe is an honorary doctor[8] of Charles University in Prague.\nHe was the lecturer in the Forty-Seventh Annual DeLong Lecture Series[9] at the University of Colorado.  He is also a recipient of the Aisenstadt Chair at CRM,[10] University of Montreal. In 2008 he was the Eisenbud Professor at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California.\n In 2012, Szemer\u00e9di was awarded the Abel Prize \u201cfor his fundamental contributions to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science, and in recognition of the profound and lasting impact of these contributions on additive number theory and ergodic theory\u201d[11] The Abel Prize citation also credited Szemer\u00e9di with bringing combinatorics to the centre-stage of mathematics and noted his place in the tradition of Hungarian mathematicians such as George P\u00f3lya who emphasized a problem-solving approach to mathematics.[12] Szemer\u00e9di reacted to the announcement by saying that \"It is not my own personal achievement, but recognition for this field of mathematics and Hungarian mathematicians,\" that gave him the most pleasure.[13]\n On August 2\u20137, 2010, the Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics and the J\u00e1nos Bolyai Mathematical Society organized a conference in honor of the 70th birthday of Endre Szemer\u00e9di.[14]\n Prior to the conference a volume of the Bolyai Society Mathematical Studies Series, An Irregular Mind, a collection of papers edited by Imre B\u00e1r\u00e1ny and J\u00f3zsef Solymosi, was published to celebrate Szemer\u00e9di's achievements on the occasion of his 70th birthday.[15][16]  Another conference devoted to celebrating Szemer\u00e9di's work is\nthe Third Abel Conference: A Mathematical Celebration of Endre Szemer\u00e9di.[17]\n Szemer\u00e9di is married and has five children.[9]\n ", "tags": ["1940 births", "Living people", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Rolf Schock Prize laureates", "Rutgers University faculty", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "21st-century Hungarian mathematicians", "Combinatorialists", "Theoretical computer scientists", "American computer scientists", "American mathematicians", "Hungarian computer scientists", "Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "Hungarian emigrants to the United States", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Abel Prize laureates", "CS1 Hungarian-language sources (hu)", "Use mdy dates from March 2012", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nEndre Szemer\u00e9diEndre Szemer\u00e9diBorn (1940-08-21) August 21, 1940 (age\u00a080)Budapest, HungaryNationalityHungarian, AmericanAlma\u00a0materMoscow State UniversityAwardsAbel Prize (2012)Sz\u00e9chenyi Prize (2012)Rolf Schock Prizes (2008)Leroy P.
