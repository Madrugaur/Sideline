{"name": "Limor Fried", "content": "Limor Fried is an American electrical engineer and owner of the electronics hobbyist company Adafruit Industries. She is influential in the open-source hardware community, having participated in the first Open Source Hardware Summit and the drafting of the Open Source Hardware definition, and is known by her moniker ladyada, a homage to Lady Ada Lovelace.\n Fried studied at MIT, earning a BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) in 2003 and a Master of Engineering in EECS in 2005.  For part of the qualification she created a project called Social Defense Mechanisms: Tools for Reclaiming Our Personal Space.  Following the concept of critical design she prototyped glasses that darken when a television is in view, and a low-power RF jammer that prevents cell phones operating in a user's personal space.[1][2]\n Fried was an Eyebeam fellow from 2005\u20132006.[3][4]\n During 2005, Fried founded what became Adafruit Industries, first in her MIT dorm room, later moving to New York.[5]  The company designs and resells open source electronic kits, components, and tools, mainly for the hobbyist market.[6]  In 2010 the company had eight employees and shipped more than $3 million worth of product.[6] The company's mission extends beyond the adult hobbyist audience to pre-school STEM education.[7] Adafruit is a company based on sharing ideas as well as resources; everyone who works for the company is offered the same 401k plan and they get paid time off for volunteer nonprofit work. [8]\n In 2009, she was awarded the Pioneer Award by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for her participation in the open source hardware and software community.[9] Fried was awarded the Most Influential Women in Technology award, in 2011, by Fast Company magazine[10] and became the first female engineer featured on the cover of Wired.[11] In that same issue of Wired, she says, \u201cHaving websites that sell parts online is a really big deal. It used to be that if you wanted to order parts to make something, you had to dig through a catalog, and they probably wouldn\u2019t even send you one if you weren\u2019t a professional. Now everything is online. You can just Google the parts to make your submarine.\u201d[12] In an interview with CNET, Fried said, \"If there's one thing I'd like to see from this, it would be for some kids to say to themselves 'I could do that' and start the journey to becoming an engineer and entrepreneur.\"[13][14] She is also quoted as saying, \u201cThere's always something newer and funner and more glossy, but we want to make sure people can actually build stuff, too.\u201d[15]\n Fried is a member of the IEEE Spectrum editorial advisory board as of late 2017.[16]\n In response to the launch of Microsoft's Kinect for the Xbox 360 in 2010, Fried, along with Phillip Torrone, organized a $1,000 challenge to create an open source driver.[6] After Microsoft condemned the challenge as modification to their product, Adafruit increased the prize to $2,000 and then $3,000.[23][24][25][26] This prompted a response from a Microsoft company spokesperson:\n Microsoft does not condone the modification of its products ... With Kinect, Microsoft built in numerous hardware and software safeguards designed to reduce the chances of product tampering. Microsoft will continue to make advances in these types of safeguards and work closely with law enforcement and product safety groups to keep Kinect tamper-resistant.[27] After significant advancements in the open source drivers, spokespeople from Microsoft stated that they did not condemn the challenge, and in fact were excited to see what the community developed.[28]\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "American electrical engineers", "American women engineers", "MIT School of Engineering alumni", "Open-source hardware", "American women company founders", "21st-century women engineers", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Year of birth missing (living people)"], "raw": "Electrical engineer\nLimor FriedLimor Fried at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2013BornUnited StatesOccupationElectrical engineerKnown\u00a0forOpen source movementSpouse(s)Phillip TorroneWebsitewww.ladyada.net\nLimor Fried is an American electrical engineer and owner of the electronics hobbyist company Adafruit Industries.
