He is also the highest ranked British Bangladeshi to be featured on the Sunday Times Rich List.\n Ahmed was born in Balaganj Thana, Sylhet District, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).[2] In 1971, at the age of 15, he moved to the United Kingdom. He attended the City College in Westminster, and a few years later he joined his family's business located in Oldham, which his brothers Kamal and Bilal joined later after the business expanded.[citation needed]\n Since March 1992, Ahmed has been CEO of the Seamark Group, which he founded with his brothers. The company Ibco is a supplier to the catering trade, and Seamark is the frozen-food processor.

In 2001, a new sales office was created in the United States to distribute products in North America, located in New Jersey and in Brooklyn, New York City.[9] He is popularly known as 'Mr Shrimp' or 'King Prawn' by the British community.[10]\n In 2006, Ahmed was nominated by The British Frozen Food Federation to represent their interest and concerns as a member of the Ethical Trading Champions' Group, which was set up as part of the Government's Food Industry Sustainability Strategy.[11]\n In 2007, Ahmed was invited to join an economic think tank, the New Enterprise Council, by George Osborne. Over the years he has played an active role in a number of government committees and advisory bodies. They include the Department of Trade and Industry's Southern Asia Advisory Group; the Competitiveness Council and the British Council's BOND initiative, which provides UK companies with low-cost introductions to potential business partners in key developing international markets.[11]\n In 2001, Ali was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2001 New Year Honours for his services to international trade.[12]\n Ahmed was recognised for services to import and export at the Legends of Industry Award at the Hilton Manchester Deansgate hotel.
