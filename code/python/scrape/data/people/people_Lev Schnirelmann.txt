His advisor was Nikolai Luzin.\n Schnirelmann committed suicide in Moscow on September 24, 1938, for reasons  that are not clear. According to Lev Pontryagin's memoir from 1998, Schnirelmann gassed himself, due to depression brought on by feelings of inability to work at the same high level as earlier in his career.[3][4] On the other hand, according to an interview Eugene Dynkin gave in 1988, Schnirelman took his own life after the NKVD tried to recruit him as an informer.[5]\n This article about a Russian mathematician is a stub.
