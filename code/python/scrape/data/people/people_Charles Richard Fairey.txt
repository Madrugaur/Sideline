{"name": "Charles Richard Fairey", "content": "\n Sir Charles Richard Fairey MBE, also known as Richard Fairey FRAeS (5 May 1887 \u2013 30 September 1956) was an English aircraft manufacturer.\n Charles Fairey was born on 5 May 1887  in Hendon, Middlesex and educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood and Ardingly College, and later as an apprentice at the Finsbury Technical College where he studied City & Guilds courses in electrical engineering and chemistry. Fairey\u2019s father had died when he was aged 11 and although from a middle-class background this dramatic change in the families circumstances led to Fairey taking a job, aged 15 with the Jandus Electric Company of London, who manufactured arc lamps. His progress was such that he was able to take charge of the installation of electric lights at Heysham docks whilst still in his teens. His next job was as an analytical chemist, working on boiler-feed and fuel problems at Municipal Borough of Finchley power station.  \nFairey became a skilled designer and builder of model aeroplanes and active member of the Kite and Model Aeroplane Association. On 4 June 1910 (aged 23) Fairey entered a model flying competition at Crystal Palace, London. His model monoplane design won 1st prize in the Longest Flight and Stability Competition with a distance of 153yds 1\u00a0ft 10in. His success in aeroplane modeling helped establish his reputation as a craftsman and innovator.\n In 1911 Fairey aged 24 became General manager with the Blair Atholl Syndicate Ltd., a company formed to develop the tailless aircraft designed by J. W. Dunne, at Eastchurch, Isle of Sheppey.\n In 1913 Fairey joined Short Brothers as chief engineer and in 1915 he formed his own company, Fairey Aviation. At the outbreak of the First World War he attempted to join first the Royal Navy Air Service and then the Royal Flying Corps, but was refused by both on medical grounds and by reason of his skill as an aeronautical engineer. A year later, at the age of 28, he formed his own aircraft company. It started with an office in Piccadilly, and factory space was found initially in The Gramophone company's facilities at Hayes.\n His standing in the United Kingdom aircraft industry led to him to be the chairman of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors in 1922-1924 and president of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1930-31 and 1932-33.[1]\n His company developed a new factory at Hayes just across the Great Western Railway.  In 1930 a 150-acre (0.61\u00a0km2) flying field was developed on land purchased from the church under the control of the vicar of Harmondsworth, Middlesex. Known as the Great West Aerodrome, it was later compulsorily purchased by the Crown during World War II, and today forms the south-eastern part of Heathrow Airport, London. Soon afterwards a seaplane base was established at Hamble.[2] He also gave his private yacht to the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. Armed and refitted, she served on anti-submarine duties as HMS Evadne.\n Fairey remained in charge of his company until his death in the early morning of 30 September 1956, Fairey, who was 69, had been suffering for several years from a heart condition. During those forty years he was involved with the development of many of the companies most important products including; aircraft, rotorcraft, marine craft, mechanical engineering and rocketry.\n ", "tags": ["1887 births", "1956 deaths", "People educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood", "People educated at Ardingly College", "People from Hendon", "English aerospace engineers", "English businesspeople", "Fellows of the Royal Aeronautical Society", "Knights Bachelor", "Members of the Order of the British Empire", "Recipients of the Medal of Freedom", "Use dmy dates from May 2012", "Use British English from May 2012", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nCharles Richard FaireyC.R.
