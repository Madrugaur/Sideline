He made personal visits to many of the victims and was accompanied by the First Lady of Chile, Cecilia Morel.[48][49]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nThis article contains a list of miscellaneous information.

It refers to his character as one of the Fellowship of the Ring. The other actors of \"The Fellowship\" got the same tattoo, with the exception of John Rhys-Davies, whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.[50]\nIn May 2006, Wood was ranked at No. 7 on Autograph Collector Magazine's list of the \"10 Best Hollywood Autograph Signers\".[51]\nWood was an active supporter of Bernie Sanders during the 2016 presidential election.[52]\nIn 2016, Wood discussed his belief that organized child sexual abuse happens in Hollywood.[53]\nIn 2019, Wood and Danish film producer Mette-Marie Kongsved had their first child together.[54]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nMain article: Elijah Wood filmography\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Elijah Wood Biography\".
