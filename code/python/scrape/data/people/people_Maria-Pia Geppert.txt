{"name": "Maria-Pia Geppert", "content": "Maria-Pia Geppert (May 28, 1907 \u2013\u00a0November 18, 1997) was a German mathematician and biostatistician who co-founded the Biometrical Journal.[1]\n Geppert was the first woman to become a full professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen.[2]\nWith Emmy Noether, Hilda Geiringer, Ruth Moufang, and Hel Braun, Geppert was one of only a handful of women to work in mathematics in Germany before World War II and later convert their degrees into research careers as full professors.[3]\n Geppert was born in Breslau, with Italian descent through her mother. Breslau is now Wroc\u0142aw, in Poland, but at that time it was part of the German Empire. Her older brother, Harald Geppert\u00a0[de] also became a mathematician, and a supporter of the Nazis.[4]\n She studied mathematics in Breslau and in Giessen,[1] and in 1932 completed a doctorate at the University of Breslau. Her dissertation, Approximative Darstellungen analytischer Funktionen, die durch Dirichletsche Reihen gegeben sind, concerned analytic number theory and was supervised by Guido Hoheisel.[5] Edmund Landau, in his last publication before Hitler came to power, commented unfavorably on one of her papers.[4]\n Next, Geppert moved to Rome, where from 1933 to 1936 she studied actuarial science and statistics for a second doctorate under the supervision of Guido Castelnuovo.[1]\nShe completed a habilitation in 1942 at the University of Giessen.
