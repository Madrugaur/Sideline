{"name": "Louis Israel Dublin", "content": "Louis Israel Dublin (November 1, 1882 \u2013 March 7, 1969) was a Jewish American statistician. As vice president and statistician of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, he promoted progressive and socially useful insurance underwriting policies.[1] As a scholar, Dublin was an important figure in the establishment of demography as a social-scientific discipline in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s.[1] Dublin was interested in eugenics but as a Jew of recent immigrant extraction criticized eugenicists for equating biological superiority with Nordic origins.[2]\n Dublin was born in Kovno, Russian Empire. He came to the U.S. in 1886 with his parents Max and Sarah (Rosensweig).  Dublin obtained his bachelor's in 1901 at City College of New York. He earned his Ph.D. at Columbia University in 1904. He married Augusta Salik on April 5, 1908.  Dublin taught at Yale as a lecturer in vital statistics.

Keys intended the BMI to be used only for the study of groups and not to be applied to individuals. The index is statistically very limited in usefulness as covered a very limited demographic of people who were able to afford life insurance and who were mostly white.[3]\n ", "tags": ["1882 births", "1969 deaths", "American statisticians", "Columbia University alumni", "Fellows of the American Statistical Association", "Presidents of the American Statistical Association", "Jewish scientists", "Emigrants from the Russian Empire to the United States", "American Jews", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from February 2014", "Articles with hCards", "All accuracy disputes", "Articles with disputed statements from February 2014", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Louis Israel DublinBorn(1882-11-01)November 1, 1882Kaunas, LithuaniaDiedMarch 7, 1969(1969-03-07) (aged\u00a086)NationalityUnited States[citation needed]EducationCity College of New YorkColumbia UniversityLouis Israel Dublin (November 1, 1882 \u2013 March 7, 1969) was a Jewish American statistician.
