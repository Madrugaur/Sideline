His works inspired a generation of Islamic astronomers in Al-Andalus, and later, after being translated, were very influential in Europe. His invention of the Saphaea (a perfected astrolabe) proved very popular and was widely used by navigators until the 16th century.[7]\n The crater Arzachel on the Moon is named after him.[6]\n Al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b was born in a village near the outskirts of Toledo, the then capital of the Taifa of Toledo.\n He was trained as a metalsmith and due to his burr skills he was nicknamed Al-Nekkach \"the engraver of metals\". His Latinized name, 'Arzachel' is formed from the Arabic al-Zarqali al-Naqqash, meaning 'the engraver'.[6]\n He was particularly talented in Geometry and Astronomy. He is known to have taught and visited C\u00f3rdoba on various occasions, and his extensive experience and knowledge eventually made him the foremost astronomer of his time. Al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b was also an inventor, and his works helped to put Toledo at the intellectual center of Al-Andalus. He is also referred to in the works of Chaucer, as 'Arsechieles'.[6]\n In the year 1085 Toledo was taken by the Christian king of Castile Alfonso VI. Al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b and his colleagues, such as Al\u2010Waqqashi (1017\u20131095) of Toledo, had to flee. It is unknown whether the aged Al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b fled to Cordoba or died in a Moorish refugee camp.\n His works influenced Ibn Bajjah (Avempace), Ibn Tufail (Abubacer), Ibn Rushd (Averro\u00ebs), Ibn al-Kammad, Ibn al\u2010Haim al\u2010Ishbili and Nur ad-Din al-Betrugi (Alpetragius).\n In the 12th century, Gerard of Cremona translated al-Zarqali's works into Latin. He referred to Al-Zarqali as an astronomer and magician.[6] Ragio Montanous[citation needed] wrote a book in the 15th century on the advantages of the Sahifah al-Zarqalia. In 1530, the German scholar Jacob Ziegler wrote a commentary on one of al-Zarqali's works. In his \"De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium\", in the year 1530, Nicolaus Copernicus quotes the works of al-Zarqali and Al-Battani.[8]\n Al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b wrote two works on the construction of an instrument (an equatorium) for computing the position of the planets using diagrams of the Ptolemaic model. These works were translated into Spanish in the 13th century by order of King Alfonso X in a section of the Libros del Saber de Astronomia entitled the \"Libros de las laminas de los vii planetas\".\n He also invented a perfected kind of astrolabe known as \"the tablet of al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b\" (al-\u1e63af\u012b\u1e25\u0101 al-zarq\u0101liyya), which was famous in Europe under the name Saphaea.[9][10]\n There is a record of an al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b who built a water clock, capable of determining the hours of the day and night and indicating the days of the lunar months.[11] According to a report found in al-Zuhr\u012b's Kit\u0101b al-Ju\u02bfr\u0101f\u012byya, his name is given as Ab\u016b al-Q\u0101sim bin \u02bfAbd al-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n, also known as al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b, which has made some historians think that this is a different person.[5]\n Al-Zarqali corrected geographical data from Ptolemy and Al-Khwarizmi. Specifically, he corrected Ptolemy's estimate of the longitude of the Mediterranean Sea from 62 degrees to the correct value of 42 degrees.[8] In his treatise on the solar year, which survives only in a Hebrew translation, he was the first to demonstrate the motion of the solar apogee relative to the fixed background of the stars. He measured its rate of motion as 12.04 seconds per year, which is remarkably close to the modern calculation of 11.77 seconds.[12]  Al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b's model for the motion of the Sun, in which the center of the Sun's deferent moved on a small, slowly rotating circle to reproduce the observed motion of the solar apogee, was discussed in the thirteenth century by Bernard of Verdun[13] and in the fifteenth century by Regiomontanus and Peurbach. In the sixteenth century Copernicus employed this model, modified to heliocentric form, in his De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium.[14]\n !--(Missing words and references, please fix) Al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b also contributed to the famous  of Toledo, an adaptation of earlier astronomical data to the location of Toledo along with the addition of some new material.[5]--! Al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b was famous as well for his own Book of Tables, of which many had been compiled.  Al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b' almanac contained tables which allowed one to find the days on which the Coptic, Roman, lunar, and Persian months begin, other tables which give the position of planets at any given time, and still others facilitating the prediction of solar and lunar eclipses.<citation needed>\n He also compiled an almanac that directly provided \"the positions of the celestial bodies and need no further computation\". The work provided the true daily positions of the sun for four Julian years from 1088 to 1092, the true positions of the five planets every 5 or 10 days over a period of 8 years for Venus, 79 years for Mars, and so forth, as well as other related tables.[15][16]\n His Zij and Almanac were translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the 12th century, and contributed to the rebirth of a mathematically based astronomy in Christian Europe and were later incorporated into the Tables of Toledo in the 12th century and the Alfonsine tables in the 13th century.[15]\n In designing an instrument to deal with Ptolemy's complex model for the planet Mercury, in which the center of the deferent moves on a secondary epicycle, al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b noted that the path of the center of the primary epicycle is not a circle, as it is for the other planets. Instead it is approximately oval and similar to the shape of a pignon (or pine nut).[17]  Some writers have misinterpreted al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b's description of an earth-centered oval path for the center of the planet's epicycle as an anticipation of Johannes Kepler's sun-centered elliptical paths for the planets.[18] Although this may be the first suggestion that a conic section could play a role in astronomy, al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b did not apply the ellipse to astronomical theory and neither he nor his Iberian or Maghrebi contemporaries used an elliptical deferent in their astronomical calculations.[19]\n Major Works and publications\u00a0:\n ", "tags": ["1029 births", "1087 deaths", "11th-century Arabs", "11th-century mathematicians", "Astronomers of medieval Islam", "Mathematicians of medieval Islam", "Astrologers of medieval Islam", "Inventors of medieval Islam", "Medieval Spanish astrologers", "Medieval Arab astrologers", "Medieval Moorish astronomers", "Medieval Arab astronomers", "Medieval Arab engineers", "Medieval Arab clockmakers", "Medieval Moorish mathematicians", "Medieval Arab mathematicians", "Scientific instrument makers", "Muslim inventors", "People from Toledo, Spain", "11th-century astronomers", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "Articles having same image on Wikidata and Wikipedia", "Articles containing Arabic-language text", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from April 2014", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\"Arzachel\" redirects here.
