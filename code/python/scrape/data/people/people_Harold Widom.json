{"name": "Harold Widom", "content": "Harold Widom (September 23, 1932 \u2013 January 20, 2021)[1] was an American mathematician best known for his contributions to operator theory and random matrices. He was appointed to the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1968 and became professor emeritus in 1994.\n Widom was born in Newark, New Jersey.[2] He studied at Stuyvesant High School, graduating in 1949, and was a member of the school's math team along with his brother Benjamin Widom (1944, 1948).[3]  Widom attended City College of New York until 1951, during which he was one of the winners of the\nWilliam Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition (1951).  At the University of Chicago he obtained an M.S. (1952) and Ph.D., the latter on a thesis Embedding of AW*-algebras advised by Irving Kaplansky (1955).[4]\nHe taught mathematics  at Cornell University (1955\u201368) where he started his work on Toeplitz and Wiener-Hopf operators, partly inspired by Mark Kac.[5]\n Widom was appointed in the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz and became professor emeritus in 1994. His research areas[6] were in integral equations and operator theory, in particular the determination of the spectra of a semi-infinite Toeplitz matrix and Wiener-Hopf operators, and the asymptotic behavior of the spectra of various classes of operators. The latter was looked at from the point of view of pseudodifferential operators (which generalize both integral and partial differential operators) on manifolds.\n More recently, his mathematical contributions with his long-term collaborator Craig Tracy have been recognized through the award of several prizes for their joint work on Tracy\u2013Widom distribution functions for random matrices. They used integral operators to obtain explicit representations, in terms of Painlev\u00e9 transcendents, of the limiting distributions of the largest and smallest eigenvalues in many models of random matrices (see Fredholm determinants). These same distributions have since been shown to arise in numerous other physical models, in random growth models, and in asymptotic combinatorics.\n He has been the author of two books and more than 120 journal articles, and was an associate editor of Asymptotic Analysis, Journal of Integral Equations and Applications and Mathematical Physics, Analysis, and Geometry. He was an honorary editor of Integral Equations and Operator Theory.[5]\n ", "tags": ["1932 births", "2021 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Scientists from New York City", "Stuyvesant High School alumni", "City College of New York alumni", "University of Chicago alumni", "Cornell University faculty", "University of California, Santa Cruz faculty", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "People from Newark, New Jersey", "Mathematicians from New Jersey", "Mathematicians from New York (state)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nHarold WidomBorn1932Newark, New JerseyNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ChicagoCity College of New YorkScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsCornell UniversityUniversity of California, Santa CruzDoctoral advisorIrving Kaplansky\n\nHarold Widom (September 23, 1932 \u2013 January 20, 2021)[1] was an American mathematician best known for his contributions to operator theory and random matrices.
