{"name": "Rasmus Lerdorf", "content": "\n Rasmus Lerdorf (born 22 November 1968) is a Danish-Canadian[1] programmer. He co-authored and inspired the PHP scripting language, authoring the first two versions of the language and participating in the development of later versions led by a group of developers including Jim Winstead (who later created blo.gs), Stig Bakken, Shane Caraveo, Andi Gutmans, and Zeev Suraski. He continues to contribute to the project.\n Lerdorf was born on Disko Island in Greenland and moved to Denmark in his early years.[2] Lerdorf's family moved to Canada from Denmark in 1980, and later moved to King City, Ontario in 1983.[3] He graduated from King City Secondary School in 1988, and in 1993 he graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Systems Design Engineering. He contributed to the Apache HTTP Server and he added the LIMIT clause to the mSQL DBMS. A variant of this LIMIT clause had already been around for a decade in mainframe relational database management systems (like Oracle Rdb running on VAX/VMS, formerly from Digital Equipment Corporation), but apparently it had not yet been picked up by the emerging PC-based databases. It was later adapted by several other SQL-compatible DBMS.[4][5] He released the first version of PHP in 1995.[6]\n From September 2002 to November 2009 Lerdorf was employed by Yahoo! Inc. as an Infrastructure Architecture Engineer. In 2010, he joined WePay in order to develop their application programming interface.[7] Throughout 2011 he was a roving consultant for startups. On 22 February 2012 he announced on Twitter that he had joined Etsy.[8] In July 2013 Rasmus joined Jelastic as a senior advisor to help them with the creation of new technology.[9]\n Lerdorf is a frequent speaker at Open Source conferences around the world. During his keynote presentation at OSCMS 2007, he presented a security vulnerability in each of the projects represented at the conference that year.[10]\n Lerdorf also appeared at the WeAreDevelopers Conferences 2017 and 2019,[11] making a speech on the history of PHP, the new PHP 7 release in 2017, and the 25 years of PHP.[12]\n In 2003, Lerdorf was named in the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[13]\n ", "tags": ["Greenlandic Inuit people", "Greenlandic people of Danish descent", "Danish computer scientists", "Greenlandic emigrants to Canada", "Free software programmers", "University of Waterloo alumni", "King City Secondary School alumni", "People from Qaasuitsup", "1968 births", "Living people", "Web developers", "PHP writers", "Programming language designers", "Danish computer programmers", "People from Qeqertarsuaq", "20th-century Canadian scientists", "21st-century Canadian scientists", "Use dmy dates from June 2020", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia external links cleanup from August 2014", "Wikipedia spam cleanup from August 2014", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nDanish programmer and creator of PHP\nRasmus LerdorfBorn (1968-11-22) 22 November 1968 (age\u00a052)Qeqertarsuaq (prev.
