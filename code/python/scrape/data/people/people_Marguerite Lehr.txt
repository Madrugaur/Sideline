{"name": "Marguerite Lehr", "content": "Marguerite Lehr (October 22, 1898 \u2013 December 14, 1987) was an American mathematician who studied algebraic geometry, humanism in mathematics, and mathematics education.[1][2][3]\n Born on October 22, 1898 to Margaret Kreuter and George Lehr in Baltimore, Marguerite Lehr attended Goucher College for her undergraduate education and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1919. After her undergraduate education, Lehr moved to Rome to study at the University of Rome for the 1923\u20131924 academic year, funded by the American Association of University Women and the M. Carey Thomas University Fellowship. In 1925, Lehr earned her Ph.D. at Bryn Mawr College.[1][2]\n After earning her doctorate, Lehr stayed at her alma mater, Bryn Mawr, as an instructor; she was promoted to associate lecturer in 1929, assistant professor in 1935, and associate professor in 1937. In 1955, she was made a full professor. While at Bryn Mawr, she had temporary or honorary appointments at several other universities. At Johns Hopkins University, she was an honorary fellow from 1931 to 1932; she was also a visiting fellow at Princeton University from 1956 to 1957. In 1958 she was given a traveling lectureship by the Mathematical Association of America and the National Science Foundation, and was funded to give lectures across the country. She also worked with the MAA and NBC to produce educational films about mathematics, and conducted a televised lecture course on mathematics in 1953 and 1954.[1][2] While at Princeton, and for the following decade, she was a member of the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Award committee. \nShe was also a member of the International Federation of University Women awards committee. Lehr lectured at Swarthmore College in the summer of 1944, and researched at the Institut Poincar\u00e9 in Paris in 1950.[1][2]\n Lehr was honored by Goucher College for her work with a \"distinguished citation\" in 1954. She was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the American Mathematical Society, the International Biometric Society, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and the Mathematical Association of America.[1][2]\n \n ", "tags": ["Women mathematicians", "American women scientists", "20th-century American mathematicians", "1898 births", "1987 deaths", "Bryn Mawr College alumni", "Bryn Mawr College faculty", "Goucher College alumni", "Princeton University fellows", "People from Baltimore", "Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science", "Mathematics educators", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nMarguerite LehrBorn(1898-10-22)October 22, 1898Baltimore, MarylandDiedDecember 14, 1987(1987-12-14) (aged\u00a089)AwardsFellow of the American Association for the Advancement of ScienceAcademic backgroundAlma materGoucher CollegeSapienza University of RomeBryn Mawr CollegeAcademic workInstitutionsBryn Mawr College,Main interestsMathematician\n\nMarguerite Lehr (October 22, 1898 \u2013 December 14, 1987) was an American mathematician who studied algebraic geometry, humanism in mathematics, and mathematics education.[1][2][3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career and research\n3 Honors and awards\n4 References\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nBorn on October 22, 1898 to Margaret Kreuter and George Lehr in Baltimore, Marguerite Lehr attended Goucher College for her undergraduate education and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1919.
