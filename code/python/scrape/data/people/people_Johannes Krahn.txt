He continued his studies 1927 to 1928 at the K\u00f6lner Werkschulen as Meistersch\u00fcler of Dominikus B\u00f6hm, who interested him in building churches.

In 1954 he completed at the Konstablerwache in Frankfurt the early skyscraper Bienenkorbhaus (Beehive House).[3][4] His church building St. Wendel, Frankfurt (1957) has been compared to Le Corbusier in terms of materials and flow of light.[5] In 1962 he built the Klaus-von-der-Fl\u00fce Friedenskirche in W\u00f6rsdorf.[2] In 1965 Krahn created a variation on the interplay of  stonemasonry, glass and concrete of St. Wendel in St. Martin, Idstein.[5] In 1966 he built St. Sebastian in Frankfurt.[2] In 1973 he built the City-Hochhaus\u00a0[de] in Frankfurt, together with Richard Heil.
