{"name": "Wolfgang L\u00fcck", "content": "Wolfgang L\u00fcck (born 19 February 1957 in Herford) is a German mathematician who is an internationally recognized expert in Algebraic topology.\n After receiving his Abitur from the Ravensberger Gymnasium in Herford in 1975, he studied at the University of G\u00f6ttingen where he obtained his Diplom in 1981 and his doctoral degree under Tammo tom Dieck in 1984. His thesis was entitled Eine allgemeine Beschreibung f\u00fcr Faserungen auf projektiven Klassengruppen und Whiteheadgruppen.\n From 1982 on he was research assistant and from 1985 on he was assistant in G\u00f6ttingen. In 1989 L\u00fcck received his Habilitation. From 1990-91, he was Associate Professor at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. From 1991 until 1996, he was professor at the University of Mainz, and from 1996 until 2010 he taught at the University of M\u00fcnster. Since 2010 he has been a professor at the University of Bonn. In 2003, he was awarded the Max Planck Research Award and in 2008 the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize.\n L\u00fcck has made significant contributions in topology; he and his coauthors resolved many cases of the Farrell-Jones conjecture and the Borel conjecture. He has also contributed to the development of the theory of L2-invariants (such as L2-Betti numbers and L2-cohomology) of manifolds, which were originally introduced by Michael Atiyah and are defined by means of operator algebras. These invariants have applications in group theory and geometry.\n In 2009 and 2010 L\u00fcck was president of the German Mathematical Society, whose vice president he had been since 2006. From 2011 until 2017, he was Director of the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics (HIM) in Bonn. In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[1]\n ", "tags": ["1957 births", "Living people", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners", "University of M\u00fcnster faculty", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "People from Herford", "University of Kentucky faculty", "Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz faculty", "University of Bonn faculty", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty", "Topologists", "21st-century German mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\n Wolfgang L\u00fcck at Oberwolfach in 2006\nWolfgang L\u00fcck (born 19 February 1957 in Herford) is a German mathematician who is an internationally recognized expert in Algebraic topology.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and work\n2 Selected publications\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nLife and work[edit]\nAfter receiving his Abitur from the Ravensberger Gymnasium in Herford in 1975, he studied at the University of G\u00f6ttingen where he obtained his Diplom in 1981 and his doctoral degree under Tammo tom Dieck in 1984.
