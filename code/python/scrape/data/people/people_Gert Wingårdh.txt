{"name": "Gert Wing\u00e5rdh", "content": "Gert Wing\u00e5rdh (born 1951) is a Swedish architect whose company, Wing\u00e5rdh arkitektkontor, maintains an international practice.[1]\n Gert Wing\u00e5rdh was born 1951 into a wealthy family in Sk\u00f6vde, V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland county, as the only child.[2] His father owned the local cement factory and the family\u2019s house was built on a limestone mountain. Both cement and limestone are materials Wing\u00e5rdh later has used in his work.\n When Wing\u00e5rdh was ten the family moved to Gothenburg. After moving to Gothenburg he was bullied by other children for a while.[3] As a teenager he took interest in art and cinema.\n Wing\u00e5rdh still lives in metropolitan Gothenburg, near Marstrand in Kung\u00e4lv Municipality with his family.[4] His home, an old cottage in the picturesque setting of an ancient village, contrasts sharply with the modernist style and skyscrapers with squares and sharp edges that he designs in his professional life.[5]\n Wing\u00e5rdh studied economics, art history and architecture in the 1970s at Gothenburg University and Chalmers University of Technology, and has in interviews stated that it was a visit to the Pantheon, Rome, that made him decide to become an architect.[6] Before deciding to become an architect he had plans to be an art-gallery owner.[3]\n He received his degree in architecture from Chalmers in 1975.\n Gert Wing\u00e5rdh started as an interior decorator in the 1970s.[7] After graduating he joined an architectural firm for a short while before setting up his own office in 1977. He had his big breakthrough as a regular architect with the \u00d6ijared Executive Country Club outside Gothenburg in 1988. The building rendered him a Kasper Salin Prize.\n He has had a number of assignments in the United States and Germany in recent years.\nWing\u00e5rdh is also the creator of the Swedish embassies in Washington[8] and Berlin. Most of his realized buildings, however, can be found in Sweden and in particular in the area of metropolitan Gothenburg. In 2007 Wing\u00e5rdh won a major international competition for a large new shopping centre in Malm\u00f6,[9] and in the same year seven of the twelve hottest architecture projects in the capital Stockholm \u2013 listed by a Swedish national daily \u2013 were designed by Wing\u00e5rdh.[10]\n Several spectacular projects have created considerable attention but remained unexecuted, such as a conference centre in \u00d6stersund, J\u00e4mtland, on the top of a mountain, called Breath of Life.[11][12] Features developed in these experimental projects do occasionally return in built projects later, such as the curved glass facade that is realized in the shopping mall Emporia in Malm\u00f6 2011.[13]\n Because of his skills, his way of constantly attract the media attention and the many prizes he has received, he is generally considered the most renowned living Swedish architect.[14] His role as a public figure is not without controversy, though. He has for example been known to be an advocate of skyscrapers which has made him a subject of critique from some (Swedish) colleagues.[4]\n He became PhD (HC) at Chalmers University of Technology in 1999 and received the Prince Eugene Medal in 2005.[1] In 2007 Gert Wing\u00e5rdh was appointed adjunct professor in building design at the architecture faculty at Chalmers.[15]\n The Wing\u00e5rdh office has circa 150 employees (2010).\n Gert Wing\u00e5rdh started as a Postmodernist in the 1980s, as one of the architects who broke away from the strong Functionalist (International style) norm that held sway over Scandinavia longer than in other countries.\n He is known to pick up new trends in architecture quickly and interpret them with a personal expressive language which integrates the surrounding landscapes into the projects:[16] \"His buildings do not stubbornly adhere to one style but are a response to the task in hand and the surrounding environmental conditions. Sweden\u2019s [sic] rich tradition of building with wood and a strong ecological awareness is combined with high tech expertise\".[17]\n Wing\u00e5rdh has himself described his architecture as \u201dhigh organic\u201d, combining high tech with organic architecture.[18] He also has been described as a \u201dmaximalist\u201d rather than a \u201dminimalist\u201d, his buildings being \u201da kind of modern baroque\u201d.[19] He has shown influences from and kinship with such different architects as Frank Lloyd Wright, Hans Scharoun, Carlo Scarpa, Frank Gehry and Peter Zumthor.[19] Another paradoxical description states that his buildings are both \u201dplayful\u201d and \u201dstrict\u201d.[20]\n A feature of Wing\u00e5rdh's is to surprise the visitors of the buildings, keeping the entrance of a building low and then \u201dheighten the sense of space and drama when entering the main rooms\u201d.[21] He also has a good knowledge of details as well as an understanding of intricate building structures which requires good knowledge of sociological processes and human behaviour.[22]\n His building for the \u00d6ijared Executive Country Club, Lerum, was awarded the Kasper Salin Prize in 1988, and the Astra Zeneca R&D Site, M\u00f6lndal, was awarded the same prize in 1993.[23] He received the ECSN European Award for Excellence in Concrete in 2002 for the Arlanda air traffic control tower. Other buildings include the Universeum Science Centre, Gothenburg (2001), and the auditorium and Student Union at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg (2001), the latter also received the Kaspar Salin Prize. And in 2006 the Aran\u00e4s Senior High School in Kungsbacka was awarded the same prestigious prize. He was awarded the Prince Eugen Medal for architecture in 2005.[24]\n In 2006 Wing\u00e5rdh also was nominated for the Mies van der Rohe Award for Mimer's house in Kung\u00e4lv. House of Sweden was awarded the American Architecture Awards by the Chicago Athenaeum 2007.[25]\n The Washington embassy also received the Kasper Salin Prize 2007, making it Wing\u00e5rdh's fifth Kasper Salin Prize\u2014which places him in a league of his own among Swedish architects.[26][27]\n At the 2008 World Architecture Festival in Barcelona Wing\u00e5rdh was declared the \u201dclear winner\u201d in the shopping category for the K:fem building in V\u00e4llingby, Stockholm.[28] At the  2012 World Architecture Festival in Singapore, Victoria Tower in Stockholm was the winner in the hotel category. And at the 2013 World Architecture Festivale in Singapore the Emporia shopping center in Hyllie outside Malm\u00f6 was declared the winner in the shopping category.[29]\n Gert Wing\u00e5rdh's awarded projects and his contributions to the public debate on architecture [30][31] have contributed to a changed image of architecture and architects in Sweden.[32] A will to create new solutions for every new task[32] has enhanced the variation in the production but reduced his impact as a stylistic beacon.[33] An ambition to \"give the client what they did not know that they wanted\" [34] reveals a will to provoke as well as to adapt.\n Citadellbadet in Landskrona, Sweden\n Citadellbadet in Landskrona, Sweden\n M\u00fcritzeum visitors centre in Germany\n M\u00fcritzeum, facades of burnt wood\n The Piano pavilion in Lahti, Finland\n Headquarters for Gina Tricot in Bor\u00e5s, Sweden\n House 10 office block in Kista, Sweden\n Department store K:fem in V\u00e4llingby, Sweden\n ", "tags": ["1951 births", "Living people", "People from Sk\u00f6vde Municipality", "Gert Wing\u00e5rdh buildings", "Swedish architects", "Chalmers University of Technology alumni", "Recipients of the Prince Eugen Medal", "Webarchive template wayback links", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from September 2018", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from January 2018", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Swedish architect\nGert Wing\u00e5rdhWing\u00e5rdh in 2015Born (1951-04-26) 26 April 1951 (age\u00a069)Sk\u00f6vdeNationalitySwedishAlma\u00a0materChalmers University of TechnologyOccupationArchitectAwardsKasper Salin Prize 1988, 1993, 2001, 2006 and 2007, ECSN European Award for Excellence in Concrete 2002, Prince Eugen Medal 2005, Mies van der Rohe Award nominee 2006, American Architecture Awards 2007, World Architecture Festival Award 2008, 2012 and 2013.PracticeWing\u00e5rdh arkitektkontor ABBuildings\u00d6ijared Executive Country Club, Lerum, 1988, Astra Zeneca R&D Site, M\u00f6lndal, 1993-, Swedish Embassy, Berlin, 1999, Universeum Science Centre, Gothenburg, 2001, Auditorium and Student Union at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, 2001, Housing at Bo01, Malm\u00f6, 2001, Arlanda flight control tower Arlanda, Sigtuna, 2001, Aran\u00e4s Senior High School, Kungsbacka, 2006, House of Sweden, Washington, D.C., 2003-06, V\u00e4llingby shopping centre, 2008, Stockholm, M\u00fcritzeum visitors centre, Mecklenburg, 2008, Citadellbadet swimming baths, Landskrona, 2005-07, Malm\u00f6 Arena, Malm\u00f6, 2008, Building 10, Kista, 2010, Sven-Harry's Art Museum, Stockholm, 2005-11, Emporia shopping center, Malm\u00f6, 2007-12, Spira Concert hall and theatre, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, 2006-11, Naturum T\u00e5kern, Mj\u00f6lby, 2008-2011, Victoria Tower, Stockholm, 2008-11, Aula at Karolinska Institutet, Solna, 2006-13, Naturum Laponia, G\u00e4llivare, 2009-13,  Kuggen at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, 2011ProjectsVictoria Olympia Stadium, Stockholm, 1996, Scandinavian Tower, Malm\u00f6, 1997, Dalsland Lodge, 2002, Breath of Life, \u00d6stersund, 2003, Glaskasten in Marl, North Rhine-Westphalia, 2005\n\nGert Wing\u00e5rdh (born 1951) is a Swedish architect whose company, Wing\u00e5rdh arkitektkontor, maintains an international practice.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Personal life\n2 Education\n3 Career\n4 Architectural style\n5 Awards\n6 Influences on architecture\n7 Notes and references\n\n7.1 Selected books about Gert Wing\u00e5rdh\n\n\n8 External links\n\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nGert Wing\u00e5rdh was born 1951 into a wealthy family in Sk\u00f6vde, V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland county, as the only child.[2] His father owned the local cement factory and the family\u2019s house was built on a limestone mountain.
