{"name": "Jean Gaston Darboux", "content": "Jean-Gaston Darboux FAS MIF FRS FRSE (14 August 1842\u00a0\u2013 23 February 1917) was a French mathematician.[2]\n According to his birth certificate, he was born in N\u00eemes in France on 14 August 1842, at 1 am. However, probably due to the midnight birth, Darboux himself usually reported his own birthday as 13 August, e.g. in his filled form for L\u00e9gion d'Honneur.\n His parents were Fran\u00e7ois Darboux, businessman of mercery, and Alix Gourdoux. The father died when Gaston was 7. His mother undertook the mercery business with great courage, and insisted that her children receive good education. Gaston had a younger brother, Louis, who taught mathematics at the Lyc\u00e9e N\u00eemes for almost his entire life. [3]\n He studied at the N\u00eemes Lyc\u00e9e and the Montpellier Lyc\u00e9e before being accepted as the top qualifier at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in 1861,[4] and received his Ph.D. there in 1866. His thesis, written under the direction of Michel Chasles, was titled Sur les surfaces orthogonales. During his studies at the ENS, he also took lectures in Sorbonne University and Coll\u00e8ge de France.\n In 1870, he co-founded the journal Bulletin des sciences math\u00e9matiques et astronomiques, called \"Darboux's Journal\" by his contemporary mathematicians. The editorial board was also formed by the mathematicians Paul \u00c9mile Appell, \u00c9mile Borel, Jacques Hadamard and Amedeo Guillet, with Darboux in the role of President. The publishing house was the Henry Gauthier-Villars et Cle \u00c9diteurs, located in Paris.[5]\n In 1872, Darboux married the Beauvaisian milliner Am\u00e9lie C\u00e9lina Carbonnier (1848-1911), daughter of Charles Louis Carbonnier, tailor, and Marie Victorine Anastase H\u00e8nocq. He and C\u00e9lina had two children, Jean-Gaston (1870-1921), who was born at the time of the Siege of Paris and later became a marine zoologist at the Faculty of Science in Marseille, and Ana\u00efs Berthe Lucie (1873-1970). [6]\n He participated in the foundation of the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de jeunes filles in 1880, an institute that aimed at training female educators and ran parallel to the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure on rue d'Ulm. Its first director was Julie Favre.[7]\n In 1884, Darboux was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences. \n Darboux made several important contributions to geometry and mathematical analysis (see, for example, linear PDEs). He was a biographer of Henri Poincar\u00e9 and he edited the Selected Works of Joseph Fourier.\n Among his students were \u00c9mile Borel, \u00c9lie Cartan, \u00c9mile Picard, Gheorghe \u021ai\u021beica and Stanis\u0142aw Zaremba.\n In 1900, he was appointed the Academy's permanent secretary of its Mathematics section.\n In 1902, he was elected to the Royal Society; in 1916, he received the Sylvester Medal from the Society.  In 1908, he was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rome.[8]\nHe continued to contribute to the French Bulletin des sciences math\u00e9matiques, even after 1916.[5]\n There are many things named after him:\n 1873.
