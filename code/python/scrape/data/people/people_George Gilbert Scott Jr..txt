Some of his finest works, the churches of All Hallows, Southwark (1877), and St Agnes, Kennington (1880) were destroyed by Second World War bombing.[7][8] His best remaining residential work is found in the Avenues area of Kingston upon Hull, which are in a Queen Anne revival style.[9] Much of his work was in the Queen Anne revival style, or in imitation of later Gothic architectural styles.[10]\n After his father died in 1878 he became distant from the architectural business, and was supported by his inheritance.[5] In 1880 Scott became a Roman Catholic, to the shock of his family.
