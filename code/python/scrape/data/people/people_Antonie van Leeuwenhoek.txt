A largely self-taught man in science, he is commonly known as \"the Father of Microbiology\", and one of the first microscopists and microbiologists.[6][7] Van Leeuwenhoek is best known for his pioneering work in microscopy and for his contributions toward the establishment of microbiology as a scientific discipline.\n Raised in Delft, Dutch Republic, van Leeuwenhoek worked as a draper in his youth and founded his own shop in 1654. He became well recognized in municipal politics and developed an interest in lensmaking. In the 1670s, he started to explore microbial life with his microscope. This was one of the notable achievements of the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s\u20131720s).\n Using single-lensed microscopes of his own design and make, van Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe and to experiment with microbes, which he originally referred to as dierkens, diertgens or diertjes (Dutch for \"small animals\" [translated into English as animalcules, from Latin animalculum = \"tiny animal\"]).[8] He was the first to relatively determine their size. Most of the \"animalcules\" are now referred to as unicellular organisms, although he observed multicellular organisms in pond water. He was also the first to document microscopic observations of muscle fibers, bacteria, spermatozoa, red blood cells, crystals in gouty tophi, and among the first to see blood flow in capillaries. Although van Leeuwenhoek did not write any books, he described his discoveries in letters to the Royal Society, which published many of his letters, and to persons in several European countries.\n Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was born in Delft, Dutch Republic, on 24 October 1632. On 4 November, he was baptized as Thonis. His father, Philips Antonisz van Leeuwenhoek, was a basket maker who died when Antonie was only five years old. His mother, Margaretha (Bel van den Berch), came from a well-to-do brewer's family. She remarried Jacob Jansz Molijn, a painter. Antonie had four older sisters: Margriet, Geertruyt, Neeltje, and Catharina.[9] When he was around ten years old his step-father died. He attended school in Warmond for a short time before being sent to live in Benthuizen with his uncle, an attorney.  At the age of 16 he became a bookkeeper's apprentice at a linen-draper's shop in Amsterdam,[10] which was owned by the Scot William Davidson. Van Leeuwenhoek left there after six years.[11][12]\n Van Leeuwenhoek married Barbara de Mey in July 1654, with whom he fathered one surviving daughter, Maria (four other children died in infancy). That same year he returned to Delft, where he would live and study for the rest of his life. He opened a draper's shop, which he ran throughout the 1650s. His wife died in 1666, and in 1671, van Leeuwenhoek remarried to Cornelia Swalmius with whom he had no children.[13] His status in Delft had grown throughout the years. In 1660 he received a lucrative job as chamberlain for the assembly chamber of the Delft sheriffs in the city hall, a position which he would hold for almost 40 years. In 1669 he was appointed as a land surveyor by the court of Holland; at some time he combined it with another municipal job, being the official \"wine-gauger\" of Delft and in charge of the city wine imports and taxation.[14]\n Van Leeuwenhoek was a contemporary of another famous Delft citizen, the painter Johannes Vermeer, who was baptized just four days earlier. It has been suggested that he is the man portrayed in two Vermeer paintings of the late 1660s, The Astronomer and The Geographer, but others argue that there appears to be little physical similarity. Because they were both relatively important men in a city with only 24,000 inhabitants, it is possible that they were at least acquaintances; van Leeuwenhoek acted as the executor of Vermeer's will after the painter died in 1675.[15][note 3]\n While running his draper shop, van Leeuwenhoek wanted to see the quality of the thread better than what was possible using the magnifying lenses of the time. He developed an interest in lensmaking, although few records exist of his early activity. By placing the middle of a small rod of soda lime glass in a hot flame, one can pull the hot section apart to create two long whiskers of glass. Then, by reinserting the end of one whisker into the flame, a very small, high-quality glass lens is created. Another possibility is do create a hollow glass bubble at the end of a hollow glass tube. The far side of the bubble will contain a biconvex area which can be used as lens. It is not clear which of the two methods Leeuwenhoek used, but the smallest molten lenses provided his highest magnifications. For lower magnifications he also made ground lenses.[16]\n After developing his method for creating powerful lenses and applying them to the study of the microscopic world,[17] van Leeuwenhoek introduced his work to his friend, the prominent Dutch physician Reinier de Graaf. When the Royal Society in London published the groundbreaking work of an Italian lensmaker in their journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, de Graaf wrote to the editor of the journal, Henry Oldenburg, with a ringing endorsement of van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes which, he claimed, \"far surpass those which we have hitherto seen\". In response, in 1673 the society published a letter from van Leeuwenhoek that included his microscopic observations on mold, bees, and lice.[18]\n Van Leeuwenhoek's work fully captured the attention of the Royal Society, and he began corresponding regularly with the society regarding his observations. At first he had been reluctant to publicize his findings, regarding himself as a businessman with little scientific, artistic, or writing background, but de Graaf urged him to be more confident in his work.[19] By the time van Leeuwenhoek died in 1723, he had written some 190 letters to the Royal Society, detailing his findings in a wide variety of fields, centered on his work in microscopy. He only wrote letters in his own colloquial Dutch; he never published a proper scientific paper in Latin. He strongly preferred to work alone, distrusting the sincerity of those who offered their assistance.[20] The letters were translated into Latin or English by Henry Oldenburg, who had learned Dutch for this very purpose. He was also the first to use the word animalcules to translate the Dutch words that Leeuwenhoek used to describe microorganisms.[8] Despite the initial success of van Leeuwenhoek's relationship with the Royal Society, soon relations became severely strained. His credibility was questioned when he sent the Royal Society a copy of his first observations of microscopic single-celled organisms dated 9 October 1676.[21] Previously, the existence of single-celled organisms was entirely unknown. Thus, even with his established reputation with the Royal Society as a reliable observer, his observations of microscopic life were initially met with some skepticism.[22]\n Eventually, in the face of van Leeuwenhoek's insistence, the Royal Society arranged for Alexander Petrie, minister to the English Reformed Church in Delft; Benedict Haan, at that time Lutheran minister at Delft; and Henrik Cordes, then Lutheran minister at the Hague, accompanied by Sir Robert Gordon and four others, to determine whether it was in fact van Leeuwenhoek's ability to observe and reason clearly, or perhaps, the Royal Society's theories of life that might require reform. Finally in 1677,[23] van Leeuwenhoek's observations were fully acknowledged by the Royal Society.[24]\n Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was elected to the Royal Society in February 1680 on the nomination of William Croone, a then-prominent physician.[note 4] Van Leeuwenhoek was \"taken aback\" by the nomination, which he considered a high honor, although he did not attend the induction ceremony in London, nor did he ever attend a Royal Society meeting.[26]\n By the end of the seventeenth century, van Leeuwenhoek had a virtual monopoly on microscopic study and discovery. His contemporary Robert Hooke, an early microscope pioneer, bemoaned that the field had come to rest entirely on one man's shoulders.[27] He was visited over the years by many notable individuals, such as the Russian Tsar Peter the Great. To the disappointment of his guests, van Leeuwenhoek refused to reveal the cutting-edge microscopes he relied on for his discoveries, instead showing visitors a collection of average-quality lenses.[28]\n Van Leeuwenhoek was visited by Leibniz, William III of Orange and his wife, Mary II of England, and the burgemeester (mayor) Johan Huydecoper of Amsterdam, the latter being very interested in collecting and growing plants for the Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam, and all gazed at the tiny creatures. In 1698, van Leeuwenhoek was invited to visit the Tsar Peter the Great on his boat. On this occasion van Leeuwenhoek presented the Tsar with an \"eel-viewer\", so Peter could study blood circulation whenever he wanted.[29]\n Antonie van Leeuwenhoek made more than 500 optical lenses. He also created at least 25 single-lens microscopes, of differing types, of which only nine have survived. These microscopes were made of silver or copper frames, holding hand-made lenses. Those that have survived are capable of magnification up to 275 times. It is suspected that van Leeuwenhoek possessed some microscopes that could magnify up to 500 times. Although he has been widely regarded as a dilettante or amateur, his scientific research was of remarkably high quality.[30]\n The single-lens microscopes of van Leeuwenhoek were relatively small devices, the largest being about 5\u00a0cm long.[31][32] They are used by placing the lens very close in front of the eye, while looking in the direction of the sun. The other side of the microscope had a pin, where the sample was attached in order to stay close to the lens. There were also three screws to move the pin and the sample along three axes: one axis to change the focus, and the two other axes to navigate through the sample.\n Van Leeuwenhoek maintained throughout his life that there are aspects of microscope construction \"which I only keep for myself\", in particular his most critical secret of how he made the lenses. For many years no one was able to reconstruct van Leeuwenhoek's design techniques, but in 1957, C. L. Stong used thin glass thread fusing instead of polishing, and successfully created some working samples of a van Leeuwenhoek design microscope.[33] Such a method was also discovered independently by A. Mosolov and A. Belkin at the Russian Novosibirsk State Medical Institute.[34]\n Van Leeuwenhoek used samples and measurements to estimate numbers of microorganisms in units of water.[35][36] He also made good use of the huge advantage provided by his method. He studied a broad range of microscopic phenomena, and shared the resulting observations freely with groups such as the British Royal Society.[37] Such work firmly established his place in history as one of the first and most important explorers of the microscopic world. Van Leeuwenhoek was one of the first people to observe cells, much like Robert Hooke.[38]\n Van Leeuwenhoek's main discoveries are:\n In 1687, van Leeuwenhoek reported his research on the coffee bean. He roasted the bean, cut it into slices and saw a spongy interior. The bean was pressed, and an oil appeared. He boiled the coffee with rain water twice and set it aside.[41]\n Van Leeuwenhoek has been attributed as the first person to use a histological stain to color specimens observed under the microscope using saffron[42]\n Like Robert Boyle and Nicolaas Hartsoeker, van Leeuwenhoek was interested in dried cochineal, trying to find out if the dye came from a berry or an insect.[43][44][45]\n Van Leeuwenhoek's religion was \"Dutch Reformed\" Calvinist.[46] He often referred with reverence to the wonders God designed in making creatures great and small, and believed that his discoveries were merely further proof of the wonder of creation.[47][48]\n van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes by Henry Baker\n A replica of a microscope by van Leeuwenhoek\n By the end of his life, van Leeuwenhoek had written approximately 560 letters to the Royal Society and other scientific institutions concerning his observations and discoveries. Even during the last weeks of his life, van Leeuwenhoek continued to send letters full of observations to London. The last few contained a precise description of his own illness. He suffered from a rare disease, an uncontrolled movement of the midriff, which now is named van Leeuwenhoek's disease.[49] He died at the age of 90, on 26 August 1723, and was buried four days later in the Oude Kerk in Delft.[50]\n In 1981, the British microscopist Brian J. Ford found that van Leeuwenhoek's original specimens had survived in the collections of the Royal Society of London. They were found to be of high quality, and all were well preserved.[51][52][53] Ford carried out observations with a range of single-lens microscopes, adding to our knowledge of van Leeuwenhoek's work.[54] In Ford's opinion, Leeuwenhoek remained imperfectly understood, the popular view that his work was crude and undisciplined at odds with the evidence of conscientious and painstaking observation. He constructed rational and repeatable experimental procedures and was willing to oppose received opinion, such as spontaneous generation, and he changed his mind in the light of evidence.[30]\n On his importance in the history of microbiology and science in general, the British biochemist Nick Lane wrote that he was \"the first even to think of looking\u2014certainly, the first with the power to see.\" His experiments were ingenious and he was \"a scientist of the highest calibre\", attacked by people who envied him or \"scorned his unschooled origins\", not helped by his secrecy about his methods.[22]\n The Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital in Amsterdam, named after van Leeuwenhoek, is specialized in oncology.[55] In 2004, a public poll in the Netherlands to determine the greatest Dutchman (\"De Grootste Nederlander\") named van Leeuwenhoek the 4th-greatest Dutchman of all time.[56]\n On 24 October 2016, Google commemorated the 384th anniversary of van Leeuwenhoek's birth with a Doodle that depicted his discovery of \"little animals\" or animalcules, now known as bacteria.[57]\n The Leeuwenhoek Medal, Leeuwenhoek Lecture, Leeuwenhoek (crater), Leeuwenhoeckia, Levenhookia (a genus in the family Stylidiaceae), and Leeuwenhoekiella (an aerobic bacterial genus) are named after him.[58]\n Memorial of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in Oude Kerk (Delft)\n Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is buried in the Oude Kerk in Delft.\n A cluster of Escherichia coli bacteria magnified 10,000 times. In the early modern period, Leeuwenhoek's discovery and study of the microscopic world, like the Dutch discovery and mapping of largely unknown lands and skies, is considered one of the most notable achievements of the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s\u20131720s).\n ", "tags": ["Antonie van Leeuwenhoek", "1632 births", "1723 deaths", "17th-century Dutch businesspeople", "17th-century Dutch inventors", "17th-century Dutch naturalists", "17th-century Dutch people", "17th-century Dutch scientists", "18th-century Dutch people", "Age of Enlightenment", "Burials at the Oude Kerk, Delft", "Dutch Calvinist and Reformed Christians", "Dutch microbiologists", "Dutch naturalists", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "History of biology", "Microscopists", "Natural history", "People from Delft", "Protistologists", "Dutch scientific instrument makers", "Biology and natural history in the Dutch Republic", "Scientific revolution", "CS1 Russian-language sources (ru)", "CS1: long volume value", "Wikipedia pages semi-protected against vandalism", "Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from August 2019", "Biography with signature", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with hAudio microformats", "Pages with missing ISBNs", "CS1 Dutch-language sources (nl)", "Articles with Project Gutenberg links", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BPN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ICCU identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "For the eponymous microbiology journal, see Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (journal).\n\"Leeuwenhoek\" redirects here.

He constructed rational and repeatable experimental procedures and was willing to oppose received opinion, such as spontaneous generation, and he changed his mind in the light of evidence.[30]\nOn his importance in the history of microbiology and science in general, the British biochemist Nick Lane wrote that he was \"the first even to think of looking\u2014certainly, the first with the power to see.\" His experiments were ingenious and he was \"a scientist of the highest calibre\", attacked by people who envied him or \"scorned his unschooled origins\", not helped by his secrecy about his methods.[22]\nThe Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital in Amsterdam, named after van Leeuwenhoek, is specialized in oncology.[55] In 2004, a public poll in the Netherlands to determine the greatest Dutchman (\"De Grootste Nederlander\") named van Leeuwenhoek the 4th-greatest Dutchman of all time.[56]\nOn 24 October 2016, Google commemorated the 384th anniversary of van Leeuwenhoek's birth with a Doodle that depicted his discovery of \"little animals\" or animalcules, now known as bacteria.[57]\nThe Leeuwenhoek Medal, Leeuwenhoek Lecture, Leeuwenhoek (crater), Leeuwenhoeckia, Levenhookia (a genus in the family Stylidiaceae), and Leeuwenhoekiella (an aerobic bacterial genus) are named after him.[58]\n\n\n\n\n\nMemorial of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in Oude Kerk (Delft)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntonie van Leeuwenhoek is buried in the Oude Kerk in Delft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cluster of Escherichia coli bacteria magnified 10,000 times. In the early modern period, Leeuwenhoek's discovery and study of the microscopic world, like the Dutch discovery and mapping of largely unknown lands and skies, is considered one of the most notable achievements of the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s\u20131720s).\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nAnimalcule\nRegnier de Graaf\nDutch Golden Age\nHistory of microbiology\nHistory of microscopy\nHistory of the microscope\nRobert Hooke\nList of people considered father or mother of a scientific field\nMicroscopic discovery of microorganisms\nMicroscopic scale\nScience and technology in the Dutch Republic\nScientific Revolution\nNicolas Steno\nJan Swammerdam\nTimeline of microscope technology\nJohannes Vermeer\nNotes\n\n\n^ Van Leeuwenhoek is universally acknowledged as the father of microbiology because he was the first to undisputedly discover/observe, describe, study, conduct scientific experiments with microscopic organisms (microbes), and relatively determine their size, using single-lensed microscopes of his own design.[1] Leeuwenhoek is also considered to be the father of bacteriology and protozoology (recently known as protistology).[2][3]\n\n^ The spelling of van Leeuwenhoek's name is exceptionally varied. He was christened as Thonis, but always went by Antonj (corresponding with the English Antony). The final j of his given name is the Dutch tense i. Until 1683 he consistently used the spelling Antonj Leeuwenhoeck (ending in \u2013oeck) when signing his letters. Throughout the mid-1680s he experimented with the spelling of his surname, and after 1685 settled on the most recognized spelling, van Leeuwenhoek.[4]\n\n^ In A Short History of Nearly Everything (p.\u00a0236) Bill Bryson alludes to rumors that Vermeer's mastery of light and perspective came from use of a camera obscura produced by van Leeuwenhoek. This is one of the examples of the controversial Hockney\u2013Falco thesis, which claims that some of the Old Masters used optical aids to produce their masterpieces.\n\n^ He was also nominated as a \"corresponding member\" of the French Academy of Sciences in 1699, but there is no evidence that the nomination was accepted, nor that he was ever aware of it.[25]\n\n^ The \"Lens on Leeuwenhoek\" site, which is exhaustively researched and annotated, prints this letter in the original Dutch and in English translation, with the date 17 September 1683. Assuming that the date of 1676 is accurately reported from Pommerville (2014), that book seems more likely to be in error than the intensely detailed, scholarly researched website focused entirely on van Leeuwenhoek.\n\n^ Sixty-two years later, in 1745, a physician correctly attributed a diarrhea epidemic to van Leeuwenhoek's \"bloodless animals\" (Valk 1745, cited by Moll 2003).\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ Lane, Nick (6 March 2015). \"The Unseen World: Reflections on Leeuwenhoek (1677) 'Concerning Little Animal'.\" Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2015 Apr; 370 (1666): doi:10.1098/rstb.2014.0344\n\n^ Dobell, Clifford (1923). \"A Protozoological Bicentenary: Antony van Leeuwenhoek (1632\u20131723) and Louis Joblot (1645\u20131723)\".
