The lower part of the figure shows a representation of a plano-convex lens (at the right) and its principal axis (the intersecting horizontal line).

The inner hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle shows the path of an incident ray and the outer hypotenuse shows an extension of the path of the refracted ray if the incident ray met a change of medium whose face is vertical at the point where the two hypotenuses intersect.
