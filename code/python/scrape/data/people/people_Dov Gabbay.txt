He is editor of several international journals, and of many reference works and handbooks of logic, including the Handbook of Philosophical Logic (with Franz Guenthner), the Handbook of Logic in Computer Science] (with Samson Abramsky and T. S. E. Maibaum), and the Handbook of Logic in Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming (with C.J. Hogger and J.A. Robinson).\n He is well-known for pioneering work on logic in computer science and artificial intelligence, especially the application of (executable) temporal logics in computer science, in particular formal verification, the logical foundations of non-monotonic reasoning and artificial intelligence, the introduction of fibring logics and the theory of labelled deductive systems.\n He is Chairman and founder of several international conferences, executive of the European Foundation of  Logic, Language and Information and President of the International IGPL Logic Group.
