{"name": "Carl Wolfgang Benjamin Goldschmidt", "content": "Carl Wolfgang Benjamin Goldschmidt (1807\u2013February 15, 1851)[1][2][3] was a German astronomer, mathematician, and physicist of Jewish descent[4] who was a professor of astronomy at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.[1] He is also known as Benjamin Goldschmidt,[2] C. W. B. Goldschmidt,[5][6] Carl Goldschmidt, and Karl Goldschmidt.[3]\n Goldschmidt, who suffered from an enlargement of the heart, died in his sleep and was found on the morning of February 15, 1851.[1][2]\n A student of Carl Friedrich Gauss[4] and an assistant to Gauss at the university observatory,[1][2] Goldschmidt frequently collaborated with Gauss on various mathematical and scientific works. Goldschmidt was in turn a professor of Gauss's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Bernhard Riemann.[3] Data gathered by Gauss and Goldschmidt on the growth of the logarithmic integral compared to the distribution of prime numbers was cited by Riemann in \"On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude\", Riemann's seminal paper on the prime-counting function.[7]\n In 1831, Goldschmidt wrote a mathematical treatise in Latin, \"Determinatio superficiei minimae rotatione curvae data duo puncta jungentis circa datum axem ortae\" (\"Determination of the surface-minimal rotation curve given two joined points about a given axis of origin\").[8] The paper dealt with the problem in the calculus of variations of determining the minimal surface of revolution, the surface of revolution of the planar curve between two given points which minimizes surface area.[9] Solutions to the problem exist which are not continuous; such discontinuous solutions are known as Goldschmidt solutions in honor of Goldschmidt's discovery of them.[6][10]\n In 1834, Goldschmidt co-authored, in German, the textbook Lehrbuch der analytischen Optik (Textbook of Analytical Optics) with J. C. Eduard Schmidt.[5] Together with Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber, Goldschmidt published in 1840 Atlas des Erdmagnetismus: nach den Elementen der Theorie entworfen (Atlas of Geomagnetism: According to the Elements of the Theory of Design), a series of magnetic maps.[11][12] In 1845, Goldschmidt published, also in German, a book on electromagnetism, Untersuchungen \u00fcber die magnetische Declination in G\u00f6ttingen (Studies of the Magnetic Declination in G\u00f6ttingen).[13]\n ", "tags": ["1807 births", "1851 deaths", "German astronomers", "19th-century German mathematicians", "German physicists", "Number theorists", "University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty", "Jewish physicists", "German Jews", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Carl Wolfgang Benjamin Goldschmidt (1807\u2013February 15, 1851)[1][2][3] was a German astronomer, mathematician, and physicist of Jewish descent[4] who was a professor of astronomy at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.[1] He is also known as Benjamin Goldschmidt,[2] C.
