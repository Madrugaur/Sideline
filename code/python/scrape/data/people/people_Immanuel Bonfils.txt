{"name": "Immanuel Bonfils", "content": "Immanuel ben Jacob Bonfils (c. 1300 \u2013 1377) was a French-Jewish mathematician and astronomer in medieval times who flourished from 1340 to 1377, a rabbi who was a pioneer of exponential calculus and is credited with inventing the system of decimal fractions.[1]  He taught astronomy and mathematics in Orange and later lived in Tarascon, both towns in the Holy Roman Empire that are now part of modern-day France.[2] Bonfils studied the works of Gersonides (Levi ben Gershom), the father of modern trigonometry[citation needed], and Al-Battani and even taught at the academy founded by Gersonides in Orange.[3][4]\n Bonfils preceded any attempt at a European decimal system by 150 years,[5] publishing the treatise Method of Division by Rabbi Immanuel and Other Topics (Hebrew: \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05d7\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u200e) on the general theory of decimal fractions around 1350. This was a forerunner to Simon Stevin, the first to widely distribute publications on this topic, and employed decimal notation for integers, fractions, and both positive and negative exponents.[2][6][7]\n While living in Tarascon in 1365, Bonfils published the work for which he would become best known, Sepher Shesh Kenaphayim (Book of Six Wings) (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05e9 \u05db\u05e0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd\u200e), a manuscript on eclipses that featured astronomical tables predicting future solar and lunar positions (divided into six parts).[1][8] The book included data for every important date on the Jewish calendar and even correction factors necessary for those who lived as far away as Constantinople.[6]  Breaking the tables into six parts was an allusion to the six wings of the seraphim as mentioned in the Bible in Isaiah 6:2, earning Bonfils the nickname master of the wings.[1]\n For 300 years, Bonfils' calculations which were extensively used by sailors and explorers well into the 17th century.[5] The book was translated from Hebrew into Latin in 1406 by Johannes Lucae e Camerino and into Greek in 1435 by Michael Chrysokokkes. The book inspired Chemist George Sarton to publish his own version of Six Wings nearly 600 years later.[1] Bonfils translated a number of books from Latin to Hebrew. He also wrote a treatise on the relationship between the diameter and circumference of a circle and methods of calculating square roots.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1300 births", "1377 deaths", "Jewish astronomers", "14th-century mathematicians", "Medieval French mathematicians", "14th-century astronomers", "Medieval Jewish astronomers", "Medieval French astronomers", "14th-century French writers", "Jewish writers", "14th-century translators", "14th-century Latin writers", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from July 2015", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Immanuel ben Jacob Bonfils (c. 1300 \u2013 1377) was a French-Jewish mathematician and astronomer in medieval times who flourished from 1340 to 1377, a rabbi who was a pioneer of exponential calculus and is credited with inventing the system of decimal fractions.[1]  He taught astronomy and mathematics in Orange and later lived in Tarascon, both towns in the Holy Roman Empire that are now part of modern-day France.[2] Bonfils studied the works of Gersonides (Levi ben Gershom), the father of modern trigonometry[citation needed], and Al-Battani and even taught at the academy founded by Gersonides in Orange.[3][4]\nBonfils preceded any attempt at a European decimal system by 150 years,[5] publishing the treatise Method of Division by Rabbi Immanuel and Other Topics (Hebrew: \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05d7\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u200e) on the general theory of decimal fractions around 1350.
