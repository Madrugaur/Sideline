Her research involves symbolic dynamics, combinatorics on words, discrete geometry, numeral systems, tessellations, and fractals.[2]\n Berth\u00e9 completed her baccalaur\u00e9at at age 16,[3] and studied at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure from 1988 to 1993. She earned a licentiate and master's degree in pure mathematics from Pierre and Marie Curie University in 1989, a Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes approfondies from University of Paris-Sud in 1991, completed her agr\u00e9gation in 1992, and was recruited by CNRS in 1993.[1] Continuing her graduate studies, she defended a doctoral thesis in 1994 at the University of Bordeaux 1. Her dissertation, Fonctions de Carlitz et automates: Entropies conditionnelles was supervised by Jean-Paul Allouche.[1][4] She completed a habilitation in 1999, again under the supervision of Allouche, at the University of the Mediterranean Aix-Marseille II; her habilitation thesis was \u00c9tude arithm\u00e9tique et dynamique de suites algorithmiques.[1]\n Berth\u00e9's research spans the area of symbolic dynamics, combinatorics on words, numeration systems and discrete geometry.
