Kazhdan is a 1990 MacArthur Fellow.\n Kazhdan was born on 20 June 1946 in Moscow, USSR.[1]  His father is Alexander Kazhdan. He earned a doctorate under Alexandre Kirillov in 1969 and was a member of Israel Gelfand's school of mathematics. He is Jewish, and emigrated from the Soviet Union to take a position at Harvard University in 1975.  He changed his name from Dmitri Aleksandrovich to David and became an Orthodox Jew around that time.\n In 2002, he immigrated to Israel and is now a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem as well as a professor emeritus at Harvard.\n On October 6, 2013, Kazhdan was critically injured in a car accident while riding a bicycle in Jerusalem.[2]\n Kazhdan has four children.  His son, Eli Kazhdan, was general director of Natan Sharansky's Yisrael BaAliyah political party (now merged with Likud).\n He is known for collaboration with Israel Gelfand, Victor Kac, George Lusztig (on the Kazhdan\u2013Lusztig conjecture on Verma modules), with Grigory Margulis (Kazhdan\u2013Margulis theorem), with Yuval Flicker and S. J. Patterson on the representations of metaplectic groups. Kazhdan's property (T) is widely used in representation theory.\n Kazhdan held a MacArthur Fellowship from 1990 to 1995.  He was the doctoral advisor of Vladimir Voevodsky, a recipient of the Fields Medal, one of the highest awards in mathematics. Kazhdan has been a member of United States National Academy of Sciences since 1990,  of the Israel Academy of Sciences since 2006, and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2008.  In 2012, he was awarded the Israel Prize, the country's  highest academic honor, for mathematics and computer science.[3] In 2020 he received the Shaw Prize in Mathematics.[4]\n ", "tags": ["Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities", "Israeli mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "Russian mathematicians", "Soviet mathematicians", "Israeli Orthodox Jews", "Baalei teshuva", "Russian Orthodox Jews", "MacArthur Fellows", "Living people", "Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty", "Harvard University faculty", "Soviet emigrants to the United States", "1946 births", "Israel Prize in computer sciences recipients", "CS1 maint: archived copy as title", "BLP articles lacking sources from February 2013", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Hebrew-language text", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.
