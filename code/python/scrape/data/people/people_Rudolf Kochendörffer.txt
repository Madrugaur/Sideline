{"name": "Rudolf Kochend\u00f6rffer", "content": "\n Rudolf Paul Joachim Kochend\u00f6rffer (21 November 1911 in Pankow \u2013 23 August 1980 in Dortmund) was a German mathematician who was a Professor of mathematics in the University of Rostock specialising in algebra, Group theory and theory of finite groups and their representation.[1][2] During World War II, Kochend\u00f6rffer worked as a  mathematical cryptanalyst in the mathematical referat of Inspectorate 7/IV, that would later become part of Referat I of Group IV of the General der Nachrichtenaufkl\u00e4rung (abbr. GDNA), the signals intelligence agency of the Wehrmacht and was known as a cryptographic tester of the Enigma cipher machine.[3] Kochend\u00f6rffer was a Member of the Scientific Advisory Council for Mathematics at the State Secretariat for the Higher and Specialist Schools of the GDR, a staff member of Mathematical Reviews and collaborated with the Zentralblatt MATH[2]\n Rudolf Kochend\u00f6rffers father, Albert Kochend\u00f6rffer(1877-1958) was a lending bookseller (German: Leihbuchh\u00e4ndler). His mother was Bertha Kochend\u00f6rffer. In 1930, Kochend\u00f6rffer completed his Abitur. Kochend\u00f6rffer subsequently studied at the Technical University of Berlin from 1930 to 1936 on the study of mathematics, physics and philosophy.[4]\n In 1936, he was promoted to Dr Phil, with a doctoral thesis titled: Investigations on a presumption of W. Burnside (German:Untersuchungen \u00fcber eine Vermutung von W. Burnside) (Burnside's theorem), whose doctorals advisors where among others, Ludwig Bieberbach, Issai Schur and Erhard Schmidt, but was forced to resign as a Jew in 1935. During 1938/9 he was an assistant at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. From 1939 to 1942 he was an assistant to the cryptanalysis department of the German Foreign Office (German: Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt) and from 1942-1945 he was employed as a mathematical cryptanalysis in the OKW/Chi and the GDNA. from 1946 to 1948 he worked as a Senior assistant at the Mathematical Institute of the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1948, Kochend\u00f6rffer  habilitated in the subjects of mathematics in Berlin, and was promoted to full professor, therein working as a lecturer. He then found position for a year as Professor with full lecturing for mathematics at the  University of Greifswald. At the start of the new decade in 1950, Kochend\u00f6rffer became a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Rostock, a position he held until 1966.[2]\n Kochend\u00f6rffer specialized in group theory. He was also known for writing various algebra textbooks. Between 1967-1970 Rudolf Kochend\u00f6rffer was Visiting Professor of Mathematics, Faculty of Natural Sciences at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,[5] and at the University of Tasmania. Between 1970-1977, Kochend\u00f6rffer finished his career as Professor of Mathematics at the Technical University of Dortmund.[2]\n He was a member of the Mathematische Gesellschaft der DDR\u00a0[de], German Mathematical Society and the member of Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik.[2]\n In 1960, he was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in Bronze, which was recognized in 1967. In 1963 he received the National Prize of the German Democratic Republic, National Prize III. for science and technology.\n ", "tags": ["1911 births", "1980 deaths", "German cryptographers", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from October 2017", "Use British English from October 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing German-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\n\n\nRudolf Kochend\u00f6rfferMathematician Kochendoerffer.jpgBorn(1911-11-21)21 November 1911MunichDied23 August 1980(1980-08-23) (aged\u00a068)PankowCitizenshipGermanAlma\u00a0materHumboldt University of BerlinKnown\u00a0forWriting several textbooks on algebra and group theory.<bt> Tester of Enigma cipher machine security, and decoding of Swiss Enigma K.Scientific careerFieldsalgebragroup theoryInstitutionsUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenTechnical University of Berlin Humboldt University of Berlin University of RostockJohannes Gutenberg University of MainzUniversity of TasmaniaTechnical University of DortmundGesellschaft f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und MechanikMathematical ReviewsZentralblatt MATHDoctoral advisorIssai Schur Erhard SchmidtLudwig Bieberbach\n\nRudolf Paul Joachim Kochend\u00f6rffer (21 November 1911 in Pankow \u2013 23 August 1980 in Dortmund) was a German mathematician who was a Professor of mathematics in the University of Rostock specialising in algebra, Group theory and theory of finite groups and their representation.[1][2] During World War II, Kochend\u00f6rffer worked as a  mathematical cryptanalyst in the mathematical referat of Inspectorate 7/IV, that would later become part of Referat I of Group IV of the General der Nachrichtenaufkl\u00e4rung (abbr.
