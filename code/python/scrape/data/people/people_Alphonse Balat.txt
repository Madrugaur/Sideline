{"name": "Alphonse Balat", "content": "\n Alphonse Hubert Fran\u00e7ois Balat (15 May 1818 \u2013 16 September 1895) was a Belgian architect.\n Balat was born in Gochen\u00e9e.  He studied at the Academie of Namur and obtained his degree in architecture from the Academy of Antwerp in 1838.\nIn 1839 he stayed in Paris for a year but returned after his father's death. He was soon discovered by the Walloon nobility for which he built or renovated a number of 'Ch\u00e2teau's' (amongst others Castle of Jehay-Bodegn\u00e9e, Castle of Presles). Stylistically these constructions often contained renaissance elements with a neoclassical stress. In his interior designs he also used elements from the Louis XV and Louis XVI styles.\n In 1846 Balat settled in Brussels. His was introduced to the Belgian royal family after he was noticed for his design of a temporary festive decoration for the Salle de la Madeleine (Magdalenamarkt) where the royal family had been present (1848). In 1851 and 1856 he created several temporary festive decorations for the monarchy. In 1852 he was appointed as the architect of the Duke of Brabant, the later king Leopold II of Belgium. In 1856 he constructed the town palace (H\u00f4tel) of the Marquess of Assche (Asse) in the newly planned district called 'Quartier L\u00e9opold'. It was noticed for its austere classical Neo-Renaissance facade inspired by Michelangelo's Palazzo Farnese in Rome. His rather sober classical approach was rare at that time when excessively decorated facades and interiors were much preferred . During his career he built a large number of private residences. Most of them were demolished during the 20th century.\n After Leopold II ascended the throne in 1865, Balat became his principal architect. Balat made a number of designs for the sumptuous reception rooms of the Royal Palace of Belgium such as the 'Throne Room', 'The Grand Staircase', and the 'Grande Galerie'. For this realisations he greatly followed the example of the French Royal residences. Balat realised the facade on the back of the palace and the facades of the courtyards. His design for the principal facade of the palace is deeply influenced by the work of the French architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel. It was not executed during Balat's lifetime and later completed in an altered form by Henri Maquet.\n Balat died at Ixelles, aged 76, and was buried in the Laeken Cemetery.\n His most successful architectural project are the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken. It consists of a huge complex of several dome-shaped buildings in iron and glass that are connected by glass-roofed galleries. The centerpiece is the domed 'Grand Jardin d'hiver' which is a circular interpretation of the Palm House of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.\nWorking with new materials like iron and glass, Balat was obliged to abandon his 'classical' stance. This stimulated the imagination of the architect. In the steel constructions he introduced decorative motifs derived from plants and flowers. This formed a first step towards Art Nouveau architecture that was further developed by Victor Horta who served as an apprentice of Balat.\n Palace of the Marquess of Assche (Asse)\n The medieval Castle of Jehay-Bodegn\u00e9e renovated by Balat\n 'Victoria Regia' greenhouse, designed by Alphonse Balat (Meise)\n \n ", "tags": ["1818 births", "1895 deaths", "Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp) alumni", "Members of the Royal Academy of Belgium", "Burials at Laeken Cemetery", "19th-century Belgian architects", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from March 2020", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with suppressed authority control identifiers"], "raw": "Belgian architect\n\n\nAlphonse Hubert Fran\u00e7ois BalatBorn(1818-05-15)15 May 1818Gochen\u00e9e, BelgiumDied16 September 1895(1895-09-16) (aged\u00a077)Ixelles, BelgiumNationalityBelgianOccupationArchitectBuildingsRoyal Greenhouses of LaekenRoyal Palace of BelgiumRoyal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium\n\nAlphonse Hubert Fran\u00e7ois Balat (15 May 1818 \u2013 16 September 1895) was a Belgian architect.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life\n2 Royal Greenhouses of Laeken\n3 Honours\n4 Works\n5 Gallery\n6 Bibliography\n7 References\n\n\nLife[edit]\nBalat was born in Gochen\u00e9e.
