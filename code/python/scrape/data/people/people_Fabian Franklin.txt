{"name": "Fabian Franklin", "content": "\n Fabian Franklin (1853\u20131939) was a Hungarian-born American engineer, mathematician and journalist, husband of Christine Ladd-Franklin.\n The Franklin family (his parents were born in Poland) migrated from Hungary to Philadelphia (United States) when Fabian Franklin was four years old and they afterwards moved to Washington, D.C. in 1861. He was educated at Columbian College (now George Washington University) where he graduated Ph.B. in 1869. Franklin worked the following seven years as surveyor and engineer for the Baltimore City Council.[1]\n When Johns Hopkins University was founded in 1876, he had the opportunity to study mathematics, his true passion. He was awarded a doctorate in 1880[2] and he was the assistant of James Joseph Sylvester till his return to England in 1883, applying the new calculational techniques to compute binary forms.[3] In 1882 he married Christine Ladd-Franklin; the marriage was a marriage of equals, based on their shared concerns, both social and intellectual.[4]  They both studied with Charles Sanders Peirce.[5] During his short university period, some fifteen years, he published thirty papers, most of which appeared in the American Journal of Mathematics.[6]\n In 1895 he left the university to begin a new career as journalist and writer.[1] First as editor of Baltimore News (from 1895 to 1908) and after as associate editor of New York Evening Post (from 1909 to 1919). He also wrote some remarkable books on social, economic and political issues like Cost of living (1915),[7] What Prohibition Has Done to America (1922) and Plain Talks on Economics: Leading Principles and Their Application to the Issues of Today (1924) among others. He also collaborated in the launching of The Weekly Review (1919\u20131922), a journal devoted to the Consideration of Politics, of Social and Economic Tendencies, of History, Literature, and the Arts.  He also wrote a biography of the founding president of Johns Hopkins University, The Life of Daniel Coit Gilman (1910).\n ", "tags": ["1853 births", "1939 deaths", "19th-century American people", "19th-century mathematicians", "20th-century mathematicians", "20th-century American journalists", "George Washington University alumni", "Johns Hopkins University alumni", "Johns Hopkins University faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from October 2019", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 maint: ref=harv", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician, engineer and journalist 1853 - 1939\n\n\nFabian FranklinBorn(1853-01-18)January 18, 1853Eger, Kingdom of HungaryDiedJanuary 9, 1939(1939-01-09) (aged\u00a085)New York CityResting placeFerncliff Cemetery41\u00b001\u203239\u2033N 73\u00b049\u203256\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff41.02750\u00b0N 73.83222\u00b0W\ufeff / 41.02750; -73.83222Alma\u00a0materColumbian CollegeJohns Hopkins UniversitySpouse(s)Christine Ladd-FranklinScientific careerFieldsMathematics, Engineering, JournalismInstitutionsBaltimore City CouncilJohns Hopkins UniversityNew York PostThesisBipunctual Coordinates\u00a0(1880)Doctoral advisorJames Joseph SylvesterNotable studentsHenry A.
