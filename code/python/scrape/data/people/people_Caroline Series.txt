{"name": "Caroline Series", "content": "\n Caroline Mary Series FRS (born 24 March 1951)[2] is an English mathematician known for her work in hyperbolic geometry, Kleinian groups and dynamical systems.\n Series was born on 24 March 1951 in Oxford to Annette and George Series.[2] She attended Oxford High School for Girls and from 1969 studied at Somerville College, Oxford, where she was interviewed for admission by Anne Cobbe.[3] She obtained a B.A. in Mathematics in 1972 and was awarded the university Mathematical Prize. She was awarded a Kennedy Scholarship and studied at Harvard University from 1972, obtaining her Ph.D. in 1976[4] supervised by George Mackey on the Ergodicity of product groups.[4][1]\n In 1976\u201377 she was a lecturer at University of California, Berkeley, and in 1977\u201378 she was a research fellow at Newnham College, Cambridge. From 1978 she was at the University of Warwick, first as a lecturer, then, from 1987, as a reader, and from 1992 as a professor. From 1999 to 2004 she was Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Senior Research Fellow at the University of Warwick.\n In the 1970s, Series found illustrations of Rufus Bowen's Theory of Dynamic Systems in the geometry of continued fractions and two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, effect of Fuchsian groups. After that she investigated similar, including fractal, geometric patterns in three-dimensional hyperbolic spaces, with Klein groups  as symmetry groups. The computer images led to a book project with David Mumford and David Wright, which took over ten years. Other coauthors are Linda Keen and Joan Birman.\n Series became the third woman to be president of the London Mathematical Society when she held the post in 2017\u20132019.[5][6]\n She is Emeritus Professor in Mathematics at the University of Warwick.[2]\n In 1987 she was awarded the Junior Whitehead Prize by the London Mathematical Society. In 1992 she held the Rouse Ball Lecture in Cambridge, and in 1986 she was the invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berkeley (Symbolic Dynamics for Geodesic Flows). From 1990 to 2001 she was the editor of the Student Texts of the London Mathematical Society. In 1986 she was a founding member of European Women in Mathematics (EWM).[7] In 2009 she was the Emmy Noether visiting professor at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. She was elected  a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in its inaugural class of 2013. She is an Honorary Fellow of Somerville College.[8]\n She is the daughter of the physicist George Series.[2]\n \u201cAll text published under the heading 'Biography' on Fellow profile pages is available under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\u201d --Royal Society Terms, conditions and policies at the Wayback Machine (archived September 25, 2015) \n ", "tags": ["1951 births", "Living people", "Alumni of Somerville College, Oxford", "Harvard University alumni", "20th-century English mathematicians", "21st-century English mathematicians", "British women mathematicians", "Academics of the University of Warwick", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "Members of Academia Europaea", "Whitehead Prize winners", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "Female Fellows of the Royal Society", "Fellows of Somerville College, Oxford", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Webarchive template wayback links", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from March 2017", "Use British English from March 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "English mathematician\n\n\nCaroline SeriesFRSCaroline Series at the Royal Society admissions day in London for new fellows in 2016BornCaroline Mary Series (1951-03-24) 24 March 1951 (age\u00a070)OxfordCitizenshipEnglishEducationOxford High School for GirlsAlma\u00a0mater\nSomerville College, Oxford (B.A.)\nHarvard University (Ph.D.)\nAwards\nWhitehead Prize (1987)\nFellow of the Royal Society (2016)\nScientific careerFieldsHyperbolic geometryKleinian groupsDynamical systemsInstitutionsUniversity of California, BerkeleyNewnham College, CambridgeUniversity of WarwickThesisErgodic action of product groups\u00a0(1976)Doctoral advisorGeorge Mackey[1]Doctoral studentsRalf J.
