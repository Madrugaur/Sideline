In these graphs the appropriate generalizations of cycles and spanning trees hinge on a proper treatment of the ends of the graph. Reviewer R. Bruce Richter writes that \"the results are extremely satisfactory, in the sense that standard theorems for finite graphs have perfect analogues\" but that \"there is nothing simple about any aspect of this work. It is a nice mix of graph-theoretic and topological ideas.\"[4]\n In 2011, K\u00fchn and her co-authors published a proof of Sumner's conjecture, that every n-vertex polytree forms a subgraph of every (2n\u00a0\u2212\u00a02)-vertex tournament, for all but finitely many values of\u00a0n. MathSciNet reviewer K. B.
