{"name": "Tony Robbin", "content": "Tony Robbin (born November 24, 1943 in Washington, DC) is an American artist and author, who works with painting, sculpture and computer visualizations.\nHe is considered part of the Pattern and Decoration (P&D) art movement.[1]\n Robbin has had over 25 solo exhibitions of his painting and sculpture since his debut at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1974, and has been included in over 100 group exhibitions in 12 countries.\n Robbin was granted a patent for the application of quasicrystal geometry to architecture,[notes 1] and has implemented this geometry for a large-scale architectural sculpture at the Danish Technical University in Kongens Lyngby, Denmark, as well as one for the city of Jacksonville, Florida.\n Robbin is the author of four books: Fourfield: Computers, Art, & the 4th Dimension (1992 ),[books 1] Engineering A New Architecture,[books 2] (1996),[2] Shadows of Reality[books 3] (2006) and Mood Swings A Painters Life[books 4]  (2011), an autobiography.\n Robbin is a pioneer in the computer visualization of four-dimensional geometry. Since 1981, his realtime rotation programs of four-dimensional figures have been useful for obtaining an intuitive feel for four-dimensional space, and quasicrystal space.
