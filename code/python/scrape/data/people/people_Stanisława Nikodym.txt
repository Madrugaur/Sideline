{"name": "Stanis\u0142awa Nikodym", "content": "Stanis\u0142awa Nikodym  (n\u00e9e Liliental; 2 July 1897, Warsaw \u2014 25 March 1988, Warsaw) was a Polish mathematician and artist. She is known for her results in continuum theory, especially on Jordanian continuums.\n Stanis\u0142awa Dorota Liliental was born in Warsaw to Regina Lilientalowa, an ethnographer, and Nathan Liliental. Stanis\u0142awa had a younger brother, Antoni (born 1908). She attended Helena Sk\u0142odowska-Szalay's primary school, and went to Warsaw's private school for women for 7 years. She joined the Warsaw University in 1916, reading mathematics under Stefan Mazurkiewicz, Zygmunt Janiszewski, and Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski [1]\n She married Otto M. Nikodym, a mathematician, in 1924, and joined him at Krakow. Supervised by Mazurkiewicz, she was awarded a doctoral degree from the Jagiellonian University in 1925. She was the first woman in Poland to obtain a PhD in mathematics.[2]\n Receiving government funding to study in Paris, she and Otto attended the Sorbonne for two years from 1926. In 1930, they returned to Warsaw. She took up a job at the Warsaw Polytechnic, working with Franciszek Leja till 1936, when he left for Krakow.[3]\n Her brother, Antoni, a chemist and officer in the Polish army, was murdered during the Katyn Massacre in 1940.[1] Under the Nazi occupation of Poland, unnecessary occupations, including higher education, were suppressed. The Nikodyms conducted clandestine classes in mathematics despite the danger of punishment.[4] In 1944's Warsaw Uprising, she and her husband lost their possessions, including several unpublished mathematical works. They moved to Belgium for a congress of mathematicians in 1946, and Otto gave lectures in various European cities, before they emigrated to the United States, settling in Gambier, Ohio.[5]\n After her husband's death in 1974, she donated their papers and her paintings to the Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas, Austin.[6] Stanis\u0142awa Nikodym died in Warsaw in 1988.[5]\n While on leave from university in 1918\u20131919, Stanis\u0142awa taught mathematics to soldiers in the Polish army.[2]\n Her doctoral thesis was titled On disconnecting the plane by connected sets and continua.[1]\n She published three books and several articles before the Second World War broke out.[3]\n Among her findings were necessary and sufficient conditions for a subcontinuum of a Jordanian continuum to be Jordanian. She also established that if the intersection and union of two closed sets are Jordanian continua, then so are the sets themselves.[3]\n In the 1940s, she taught mathematics at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, where her husband was also a member of the faculty.[7]\n As a student, Liliental participated in open-air painting in Sandomierz. She painted the cityscape several times in watercolour over many years in the inter-war period from 1922. The resulting works were presented at an exhibition in 1933, after which she donated them to the District Museum in Sandomierz, where they remain to this day.[8]\n ", "tags": ["Polish mathematicians", "Polish women mathematicians", "1897 births", "1988 deaths", "Kenyon College faculty", "Jagiellonian University alumni", "University of Warsaw alumni", "Polish emigrants to the United States", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 Polish-language sources (pl)", "CS1 errors: missing periodical", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers"], "raw": "Polish mathematician\nStanis\u0142awa NikodymStanis\u0142awa Liliental as a student at Warsaw University, 1916BornStanis\u0142awa Dorota Liliental(1897-07-02)July 2, 1897WarsawDiedMarch 25, 1988(1988-03-25) (aged\u00a090)WarsawNationalityPolishCitizenshipUnited StatesAlma\u00a0materWarsaw UniversitySpouse(s)Otto M.
