Schnorr's contributions to cryptography include his study of Schnorr groups, which are used in the digital signature algorithm bearing his name. Besides this, Schnorr is known for his contributions to algorithmic information theory and for creating an approach to the definition of an algorithmically random sequence which is alternative to the concept of Martin-L\u00f6f randomness.\n Schnorr was a professor of mathematics and computer science at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe university at Frankfurt. He retired in 2011 after working there for 40 years. He is also a Distinguished Associate of RSA Laboratories, and a joint recipient of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize together with Johannes Buchmann in 1993.
