{"name": "Yuri Manin", "content": "\n Yuri Ivanovich Manin (Russian: \u042e\u0301\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u0301\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041c\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0438\u043d; born 16 February 1937) is a Russian mathematician, known for work in algebraic geometry and diophantine geometry, and many expository works ranging from mathematical logic to theoretical physics. Moreover, Manin was one of the first to propose the idea of a quantum computer in 1980 with his book Computable and Uncomputable.[1]\n Manin gained a doctorate in 1960 at the Steklov Mathematics Institute as a student of Igor Shafarevich. He is now a Professor at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Mathematik in Bonn, and a professor emeritus at Northwestern University.[2][3]\n Manin's early work included papers on the arithmetic and formal groups of abelian varieties, the Mordell conjecture in the function field case, and algebraic differential equations. The Gauss\u2013Manin connection is a basic ingredient of the study of cohomology in families of algebraic varieties. He wrote a book on cubic surfaces and cubic forms, showing how to apply both classical and contemporary methods of algebraic geometry, as well as nonassociative algebra. He also indicated the role of the Brauer group, via Grothendieck's theory of global Azumaya algebras, in accounting for obstructions to the Hasse principle, setting off a generation of further work. He pioneered the field of arithmetic topology (along with John Tate, David Mumford, Michael Artin and Barry Mazur). He also formulated the Manin conjecture, which predicts the asymptotic behaviour of the number of rational points of bounded height on algebraic varieties. He has further written on Yang\u2013Mills theory, quantum information, and mirror symmetry.\n Manin had over 40 doctoral students, including Vladimir Berkovich, Mariusz Wodzicki, Alexander Beilinson, Ivan Cherednik, Alexei Skorobogatov, Vladimir Drinfeld, Mikhail Kapranov, Vyacheslav Shokurov, Arend Bayer and Victor Kolyvagin, as well as foreign students including H\u00e0 Huy Kho\u00e1i.\n He was awarded the Brouwer Medal in 1987, the first Nemmers Prize in Mathematics in 1994, the Schock Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1999, the Cantor Medal of the German Mathematical Society in 2002, the King Faisal International Prize in 2002 and the Bolyai Prize of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 2010.\n In 1990 he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[4]\n ", "tags": ["1937 births", "Living people", "People from Simferopol", "Algebraic geometers", "Algebraists", "Moscow State University alumni", "Northwestern University faculty", "Members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Corresponding Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences", "Rolf Schock Prize laureates", "Brouwer Medalists", "Soviet mathematicians", "21st-century Russian mathematicians", "20th-century Russian mathematicians", "Knights Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)", "Quantum information scientists", "CS1 Russian-language sources (ru)", "Use dmy dates from February 2021", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Russian-language text", "All articles with dead external links", "Articles with dead external links from July 2016", "Articles with permanently dead external links", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nRussian mathematician\nYuri ManinYuri Manin with his wife Ksenia Semenova at the ICM 2006 in MadridBornYuri Ivanovich Manin (1937-02-16) 16 February 1937 (age\u00a084)Simferopol, Soviet UnionNationalityRussianAlma\u00a0materMoscow State UniversitySteklov Mathematics Institute (PhD)Known\u00a0foralgebraic geometry, diophantine geometryAwardsNemmers Prize in Mathematics (1994)Schock Prize (1999)Cantor Medal (2002)Bolyai Prize (2010)King Faisal International Prize (2002)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicianInstitutionsMax-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr MathematikNorthwestern UniversityDoctoral advisorIgor ShafarevichDoctoral studentsAlexander Beilinson, Vladimir Berkovich, Mariusz Wodzicki, Vladimir Drinfeld, Mikhail Kapranov, Victor Kolyvagin, Alexander L.
