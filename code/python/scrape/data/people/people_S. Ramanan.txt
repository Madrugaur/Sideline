{"name": "S. Ramanan", "content": "\n S (Sundararaman) Ramanan (born 20 July 1937) is an Indian mathematician who works in the area of algebraic geometry, moduli spaces and Lie groups. He is one of India's leading mathematicians and recognised as an expert in algebraic geometry, especially in the area of moduli problems. He has also worked in differential geometry: his joint paper with MS Narasimhan on universal connections has been influential. It enabled SS Chern and B Simons to introduce what is known as the Chern-Simons invariant, which has proved useful in theoretical physics.[1]\n He is an alumnus of the Ramakrishna Mission School in Chennai and the Vivekananda College in Chennai, where he completed a BA Honours in mathematics.[citation needed] He completed his PhD at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, under the direction of MS Narasimhan. He did his post-doctoral studies at Oxford University, Harvard University and ETH Zurich.[citation needed]\n He later pursued a career at TIFR. He picked up the methods of modern differential geometry from the French mathematician Jean-Louis Koszul,[2] and later successfully applied it for his research centred on algebraic geometry. He has also made contributions to the topics of abelian varieties and vector bundles.\n He collaborated with Raoul Bott, who was at Harvard University. He has been a visiting professor at Harvard University, University of California at Berkeley, the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, UCLA, Oxford University, Cambridge University, the Max Planck Institute and University of Paris.[citation needed] In 1978, he gave one of the invited talks at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki. In 1999, he spoke about some aspects of the work of Andr\u00e9 Weil on the occasion of his being awarded the Inamouri Prize.[citation needed]\n Ramanan discovered and encouraged Vijay Kumar Patodi, who proved part of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, Patodi did his PhD under the combined direction of Narasimhan and Ramanan.[3] Ramanan was MS Raghunathan's senior colleague and influenced him considerably.[4]\n Ramanan wrote the book Moduli of Abelian Varieties with Allan Adler, published by Springer-Verlag, and a graduate-level book on algebraic geometry called Global Calculus, published by the American Mathematical Society.[5] He continues his contributions via teaching and mentoring at the Chennai Mathematical Institute,[6] where he is adjunct professor, and at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.\n Ramanan received the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, India's highest science prize,[7] in 1979; the TWAS Prize for Mathematics in 2001[8] and the Ramanujan Medal in 2008.[citation needed]\n He is married to Anuradha Ramanan, a translator and former librarian. They have two daughters, Sumana Ramanan, a journalist, and Kavita Ramanan,[9] a noted mathematician who is a professor of applied mathematics at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\n ", "tags": ["1937 births", "Living people", "Algebraic geometers", "20th-century Indian mathematicians", "21st-century Indian mathematicians", "Recipients of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in Mathematical Science", "Tata Institute of Fundamental Research alumni", "University of Madras alumni", "Ramakrishna Mission schools alumni", "TWAS laureates", "Webarchive template wayback links", "BLP articles lacking sources from March 2019", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Articles with hCards", "Use British English from January 2012", "Use dmy dates from January 2012", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from March 2019", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "This biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.
