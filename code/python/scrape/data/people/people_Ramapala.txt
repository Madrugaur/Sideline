{"name": "Ramapala", "content": "\n Ramapala (reigned 1082\u20131124 AD) was the successor to the Pala king Shurapala II in the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, and fifteenth ruler of the Pala line.[2][3]\n Rampala is recognised as the last great ruler of the dynasty, managing to restore much of the past glory of the Pala lineage. He crushed the Varendra Rebellion and extended his empire farther to Kamarupa, Orissa and Northern India. He was succeeded by Kumarapala. According to Bengali legend he died by walking into the sea.[4]\nSandhyakar Nandi, the court poet of Ramapala wrote a Sanskrit two meaning base poem-like novel Ramacharitam.\n After gaining control of Varendra, Ramapala tried to revive the Pala empire with limited success. He ruled from a new capital at Ramavati, which remained the Pala capital until the dynasty's end. He reduced taxation, promoted cultivation and constructed public utilities. He brought Kamarupa and Rar under his control, and forced the Varman king of east Bengal to accept his suzerainty. He also struggled with the Ganga king for control of present-day Orissa; the Gangas managed to annex the region only after his death. Ramapala maintained friendly relations with the Chola king Kulottunga to secure support against the common enemies: the Ganas and the Chalukyas. He kept the Sens in check, but lost Mithila to a Karnataka chief named Nanyuadeva. He also held back the aggressive design of the Gahadavala ruler Govindachandra through a matrimonial alliance.[5]\n A circa 1100-1125 manuscript of Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita,  now in LACM,[6] was copied in the Kurkihar monastery during the rule of Ramapala.\n \n This biography of a member of an Indian royal house is a stub.
