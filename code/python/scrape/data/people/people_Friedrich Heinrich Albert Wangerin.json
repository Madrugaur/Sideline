{"name": "Friedrich Heinrich Albert Wangerin", "content": "Friedrich Heinrich Albert Wangerin (November 18, 1844 \u2013 October 25, 1933) was a German mathematician.\n Wangerin was born on November 18, 1844 in Greifenberg[1] Pomerania, Prussia (now Gryfice, Poland). He studied at the gymnasium at Greifenberg and completed his final examination with an \"excellent\" grade in 1862. \n In spring 1862, Wangerin entered the University of Halle-Wittenberg, where he studied Mathematics and Physics. He was taught by mathematicians  Eduard Heine and Carl Neumann. In 1864 he moved to the University of K\u00f6nigsberg. He worked under the supervision of German mathematician Franz Ernst Neumann. He competed his doctorate from K\u00f6nigsberg University on March 16, 1866. His doctorate thesis was De annulis Newtonianis.[2]\n After he completing his doctorate, Wangerin took the examinations to become a school teacher. From 1866 to 1867, he trained at the Friedrichswerdersche Gymnasium, Berlin. From 1867 to 1876, he  taught mathematics at several gymnasiums.[2]\n Wangerin became Professor at the University of Berlin in 1876. He taught mathematics to the first year undergraduates. He left the University of Berlin in 1882 and became ordinary professor at the University of Halle-Wittenberg. The chair of ordinary professor had fallen vacant because of the death of Eduard Heine, the former teacher of Wangerin.[2]\n Wangerin held professorship at Halle for more than thirty five years. During the academic year 1910-11, he was rector of the university. He retired in 1919.[2][3]\n After the retirement, Wangerin continued to live in Halle. He was active in mathematical research. He died on October 25, 1933 in Halle.[2]\n Wangerin was known for his research on potential theory, spherical functions and differential geometry.[2] He wrote an important two volume treatise on potential theory and spherical functions. Theorie des Potentials und der Kugelfunktionen I was published in 1909 and Theorie des Potentials und der Kugelfunktionen II was published in 1921.[4] He studied Wangerin functions. \n Wangerin was also known for writing of textbooks, encyclopaedias and his historical writings.[2] In 1904, he wrote Theorie der Kugelfunktionen und der verwandten Funktionen, insbesondere der Lam\u00e9schen und Besselschen (Theorie spezieller, durch lineare Differentialgleichungen definierter Funktionen) on functions such as Lam\u00e9 function and Bessel function for the Encyklop\u00e4die der mathematischen Wissenschaften. In 1909, he wrote an article on optics (Optik \u00e4ltere Theorie) for the physics volume of the same encyclopaedia.[4]\n Wangerin also played an important role in the reviewing of mathematical papers. From 1869 to 1921, he was coeditor of Fortschritte der Mathematik.[2]\n Wangerin was elected to the German Academy of Scientists Leopoldina in 1883. From 1906 to 1921, he served as President of the Academy. In 1907, he was awarded an honorary degree from Uppsala University. He received many medals, including the 1922 Cothenius medal from the German Academy of Scientists Leopoldina.[2]\n ", "tags": ["1844 births", "1933 deaths", "People from Gryfice", "19th-century German mathematicians", "20th-century German mathematicians", "Humboldt University of Berlin faculty", "Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg alumni", "Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg faculty", "University of K\u00f6nigsberg alumni", "People from the Province of Pomerania", "Presidents of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Friedrich Heinrich Albert WangerinBornNovember 18, 1844Greifenberg, GermanyDiedOctober 25, 1933(1933-10-25) (aged\u00a088)Halle, GermanyNationalityGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Halle-WittenbergUniversity of K\u00f6nigsbergKnown\u00a0forResearch on potential theory, spherical functions and differential geometryWriting textbooks, encyclopaedias and his historical writingsScientific careerFieldsMathematicianInstitutionsUniversity of BerlinUniversity of Halle-Wittenberg\n\nFriedrich Heinrich Albert Wangerin (November 18, 1844 \u2013 October 25, 1933) was a German mathematician.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Academic career\n3 Later life\n4 Work\n5 Honors\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\nWangerin was born on November 18, 1844 in Greifenberg[1] Pomerania, Prussia (now Gryfice, Poland).
