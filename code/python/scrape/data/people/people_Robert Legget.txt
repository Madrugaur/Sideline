{"name": "Robert Legget", "content": "\n Robert Ferguson Legget CC FRSC FRSE  (September 29, 1904 \u2013 April 17, 1994) was a civil engineer, historian and non-fiction writer. He is internationally known for his contributions to engineering, geology and building research and standardization. He is credited with the establishment of co-operation among Canadian geotechnical engineers, geologists and pedologists.\n Legget was born in Liverpool, England, to Donald Thompson Legget and his wife Mary, both of whom were of Scottish descent. He was educated at the Merchant Taylors' Boys' School, Crosby.[1] He studied Civil Engineering and obtained a BEng (Hons) in 1925, and MEng 1927, from the University of Liverpool. He was initially employed as an engineer on the Lochaber Water Power Scheme in Scotland. He then emigrated to Canada in 1929, working for the Power Corporation of Canada.[2]\n In 1936, he began teaching at Queen's University and the University of Toronto. He left teaching in 1947 to establish and serve as director of the National Research Council of Canada's new Division of Building Research. He held this position until he retired in 1969. Part of his legacy there was to establish a National Building Code that was respected throughout all of Canada, as opposed to the multitude of inconsistent local codes that were prevalent in 1947.\n Around 1945, after World War II, Leggat shaped the Environmental Conservation movement in Ontario by spearheading the Guelph Conference, the Ganaraska Study and the Conservation Authorities Act of Ontario (1946). He also was a founder, in 1962, of the Canadian Permafrost Conferences.\n He was the founding President of the Canadian Academy of Engineering.\n Between 1959 and 1960, Legget was the chairman of the Engineering Geology Division of the Geological Society of America (GSA). He served as GSA president in 1966.[3]\n In 1971 he received an honorary doctorate (DEng) from the University of Liverpool. In 1977 he received the Sir John Kennedy Medal.\n After he retired, Dr. Legget wrote many books on the history of transportation in Canada including Ottawa Waterway: Gateway to A Continent, Rideau Waterway, Canals of Canada, The Seaway, and others, and he was a contributor to the Dictionary of Canadian Biography.\n Legget died in Ottawa at the age of 89. His wife, Mary Free, had died in 1984. They had one son.\n The Legget Endowment Fund is used by the Conservation Foundation on an annual basis for otherwise-unfunded current needs in the Rideau Valley.\n ", "tags": ["1904 births", "1994 deaths", "Alumni of the University of Liverpool", "Anglo-Scots", "Canadian environmentalists", "Canadian civil engineers", "Canadian geologists", "Canadian science writers", "Canadian philanthropists", "University of Toronto faculty", "Companions of the Order of Canada", "English emigrants to Canada", "Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada", "Fellows of the Engineering Institute of Canada", "Writers from Ottawa", "Canadian people of Scottish descent", "Academics from Liverpool", "Logan Medal recipients", "20th-century philanthropists", "Presidents of the Geological Society of America", "20th-century geologists", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles lacking in-text citations from March 2021", "All articles lacking in-text citations", "Use mdy dates from May 2016", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Canadian civil engineer, historian and non-fiction writer\nThis article includes a list of general references, but it remains largely unverified because it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations.
