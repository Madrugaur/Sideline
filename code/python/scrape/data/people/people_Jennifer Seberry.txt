She was formerly the head of the Department of Computer Science and director of the Centre for Computer Security Research at the university.\n Seberry attended Parramatta High School and got her BSc at University of New South Wales, 1966; MSc at La Trobe University, 1969; PhD at La Trobe University, 1971 (Computational Mathematics); B.Ec. with two years completed at University of Sydney.[1] Her doctoral advisor was Bertram Mond.[2]\n Seberry was the first person to teach cryptology at an Australian University (University of Sydney). She was also the first woman Professor of Computer Science in Australia. She was the first woman Reader in Combinatorial Mathematics in Australia.\n As of 2020[update] she had supervised 30 doctorates and had 71 academic descendants. Her notable students have included Peter Eades, Mirka Miller, and Deborah Street.[2][3]\n Seberry was a founding member of the University of Sydney's Research Foundation for Information Technology Information Security Group in 1987. The group grew into the Australian Information Security Association, an Australian representative industry body with over 1000 paid members and branches in most capitals.[4]\n Seberry was one of the founders of the Asiacrypt international conference in 1990 (then called Auscrypt).\n Seberry has contributed to the knowledge and use of Hadamard\nmatrices and bent functions for network security.[5] She has published numerous papers on mathematics, cryptography, and computer and network security. She led the team that produced the LOKI and LOKI97 block ciphers and the HAVAL cryptographic hash functions. Seberry is also a co-author of the Py stream cipher, which was a candidate for the eSTREAM stream cipher project.\n ", "tags": ["Australian mathematicians", "Women mathematicians", "Living people", "Modern cryptographers", "Computer security academics", "1944 births", "University of Wollongong faculty", "International Association for Cryptologic Research fellows", "People in information technology", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "EngvarB from August 2014", "Use dmy dates from December 2015", "Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2020", "All articles containing potentially dated statements", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Australian cryptographer, mathematician, and computer scientist\n\nJennifer Roma Seberry (born 13 February 1944 in Sydney) is an Australian cryptographer, mathematician, and computer scientist, currently a professor at the University of Wollongong, Australia.
