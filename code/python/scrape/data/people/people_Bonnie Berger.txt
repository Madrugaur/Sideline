{"name": "Bonnie Berger", "content": "\n Bonnie Anne Berger is an American mathematician and computer scientist, who works as the Simons professor of mathematics and professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her research interests are in algorithms, bioinformatics[2] and computational molecular biology.[6]\n Berger did her undergraduate studies at Brandeis University, and earned her doctorate from MIT in 1990 under the supervision of Silvio Micali.[6][3] As a student, she won the Machtey Award in 1989 for a paper on parallel algorithms that she published with fellow student John Rompel at the Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science.[7]\n After completing her PhD, Berger remained at MIT for postdoctoral research where she became a faculty member in 1992.[6] Her research in bioinformatics has been published in leading peer reviewed scientific journals including Science, the Journal of Algorithms.[2][8][9] Her former doctoral students include Serafim Batzoglou,[3] Lior Pachter,[4] Mona Singh,[5] Manolis Kellis, and Phil Bradley.\n Berger has served as vice president of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB)[10] and chair of the steering committee for RECOMB.[11]\n Berger was the 1997 winner of the Margaret Oakley Dayhoff Award.[12] In 1998 she was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin (but she was unable to make a personal appearance).[13] In 1999, Berger was included in a list of 100 top innovators published by Technology Review.[14] In 2003, Berger became a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),[15] and in 2012 she became an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and a fellow the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB).[16][17]  In 2016, Berger was inducted into the college of fellows of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE).[18] She was included in the 2019 class of fellows of the American Mathematical Society \"for contributions to computational biology, bioinformatics, algorithms and for mentoring\".[19] She also received the Honorary Doctorate at \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL). She serves as a Member-at-Large of the Section on Mathematics at American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). She was awarded the ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award in 2019.[1]  In 2020 she gave the AWM-SIAM Sonia Kovalevsky Lecture,[20] and additionally was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[21]\n ", "tags": ["Living people", "American computer scientists", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American women computer scientists", "American women mathematicians", "Brandeis University alumni", "MIT School of Engineering alumni", "MIT School of Engineering faculty", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery", "Fellows of the International Society for Computational Biology", "Fellows of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering", "Fellows of the American Mathematical Society", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "20th-century American women scientists", "21st-century American women scientists", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use mdy dates from February 2019", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ACM-DL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DBLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ORCID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Year of birth missing (living people)"], "raw": "American mathematician and computer scientist\n\n\nBonnie BergerBornBonnie Anne BergerAlma\u00a0materBrandeis University (SB)Massachusetts Institute of Technology (PhD)Awards\nMember, National Academy of Sciences (2020)\nAMS Fellow (2019)\nISCB Senior Scientist Award (2019)[1]\nAMS Fellow (2019)\nMember, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2012)\nISCB Fellow (2012)\nACM Fellow (2003)\nAIMBE Fellow\nMargaret Oakley Dayhoff Award (1997)\nMachtey Award (1989)\nScientific careerFieldsBioinformatics[2]ThesisUsing Randomness to Design Efficient Deterministic Algorithms\u00a0(1990)Doctoral advisorSilvio Micali[3]Doctoral students\nManolis Kellis\nSerafim Batzoglou[3]\nLior Pachter[4]\nMona Singh[5]\n\nWebsitepeople.csail.mit.edu/bab\nBonnie Anne Berger is an American mathematician and computer scientist, who works as the Simons professor of mathematics and professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
