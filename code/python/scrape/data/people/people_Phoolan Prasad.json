{"name": "Phoolan Prasad", "content": "\n Phoolan Prasad (born 1 January 1944) is an Indian mathematician who specialised in Partial differential equations, fluid mechanics. He was awarded in 1983 the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, the highest science award in India,  in the mathematical sciences category.  He is also a Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy (INSA).[1]\n Prasad studied in Nalhati HP High School, Krishnath College Berhampore, received his  B.Sc. from the Presidency College, Calcutta University and M.Sc. from Rajabazar Science College campus of Calcutta University followed by a Ph.D. from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore in  1968.[1]\n Prasad started his career as a lecturer in the Department of Applied Mathematics in 1967 at Indian Institute of Science, thereafter he became a Professor in 1977. Meanwhile, he also remained a Postdoctoral Fellow at Leeds University (1970\u201372) and Alexander von Humboldt Fellow (1980-81).[1]\n Prasad has done some significant work in the area on non-linear hyperbolic equations. He succeeded in assessing the basic properties of the equations of various physical phenomena, generalized these mathematical properties and then used his theory to explain new results in the field of non-linear waves.
