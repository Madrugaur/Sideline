{"name": "Welton Becket", "content": "Welton David Becket (August 8, 1902 \u2013 January 16, 1969) was an American modern architect who designed many buildings in Los Angeles, California.\n Becket was born in Seattle, Washington and graduated from the University of Washington program in Architecture in 1927 with a Bachelor of Architecture degree (B.Arch.).[1]\n He moved to Los Angeles in 1933 and formed a partnership with his University of Washington classmate Walter Wurdeman and Angelean architect Charles F. Plummer.  Their first major commission was the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in 1935, which won them residential jobs from James Cagney, Robert Montgomery, and other film celebrities.  Plummer died in 1939.\n The successor firm Wurdeman and Becket went on to design Bullock's Pasadena (1944) and a couple of corporate headquarters.  Wurdeman and Becket developed the concept of \"total design,\" whereby their firm would be responsible for master planning, engineering, interiors, furniture, fixtures, landscaping, signage, and even (in the case of restaurants) menus, silverware, matchbooks, and napkins.[2]\n After Wurdeman's death in 1949, Becket formed Welton Becket and Associates and continued to grow the firm to the extent that it was one of the largest architectural offices in the world by the time of his death in 1969. In 1987, his firm was acquired by Ellerbe Associates, and the merged firm continued as Ellerbe Becket until the end of 2009, when it was acquired by AECOM. It is now known as Ellerbe Becket, an AECOM Company.[3]\n Becket's buildings used unusual facade materials such as ceramic tile and stainless steel grillwork, repetitive geometric patterns, and a heavy emphasis on walls clad in natural stone, particularly travertine and flagstone.\n With The Walt Disney Company and the United States Steel Corporation, Becket's firm co-designed Disney's Contemporary Resort, which opened in 1971 at Walt Disney World Resort. The Contemporary was designed as a 14-story steel A-frame with a monorail running through the building. Modular guest rooms were assembled, finished, furnished, fully equipped and their doors locked, on the ground, then lifted by crane and inserted into the frame; however, this sometimes took multiple tries.[4]\n Welton Becket was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1952.\n Becket's sons, Welton MacDonald Becket & Bruce Becket, are also practicing architects, as well as his nephew[5] MacDonald G. Becket and granddaughter Alexandra Becket.[6]\n Becket's extensive list of credits includes:[7]\n ", "tags": ["Welton Becket buildings", "Architects from Los Angeles", "Modernist architects", "Fellows of the American Institute of Architects", "1902 births", "1969 deaths", "Architects from Seattle", "University of Washington College of Built Environments alumni", "20th-century American architects", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Incomplete lists from January 2011", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from December 2016", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American architect\nWelton BecketBorn(1902-08-08)August 8, 1902Seattle, WashingtonUnited StatesDiedJanuary 16, 1969(1969-01-16) (aged\u00a066)Los Angeles, CaliforniaUnited StatesNationalityAmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of WashingtonOccupationArchitectChildren2PracticeWelton Becket and AssociatesBuildingsCapitol Records BuildingPan-Pacific AuditoriumBeverly Hilton HotelDesignCentury City Master Plan\n\nWelton David Becket (August 8, 1902 \u2013 January 16, 1969) was an American modern architect who designed many buildings in Los Angeles, California.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Commissions\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nBecket was born in Seattle, Washington and graduated from the University of Washington program in Architecture in 1927 with a Bachelor of Architecture degree (B.Arch.).[1]\nHe moved to Los Angeles in 1933 and formed a partnership with his University of Washington classmate Walter Wurdeman and Angelean architect Charles F.
