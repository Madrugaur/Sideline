{"name": "Franz Woepcke", "content": "Franz Woepcke (May 6, 1826 \u2013 March 25, 1864) was an historian, Orientalist, and mathematician. He is remembered for publishing editions and translations of medieval Arabic mathematical manuscripts and for his research on the propagation of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system in the medieval era.\n Woepcke was born in Dessau in Germany. He studied mathematics at the University of Berlin, gaining his doctorate in 1847. With astronomer Johann Franz Encke and archaeologist Ernst Heinrich T\u00f6lken as his academic advisors, he penned his dissertation involving sundials of antiquity (Archaeologico-mathematicae circa solaria veterum).[1] Afterwards he studied Arabic language at the University of Bonn, where in 1850 he obtained his habilitation. Woepcke spent much of his subsequent career studying and working outside of Germany, particularly in Paris. Most of his output was written in French. In 1856 he returned to Berlin and taught classes at the Franz\u00f6sischen Gymnasium until 1858. He died in Paris on March 25, 1864 at the age of 37.\n Among his better known works are: an edition of the algebra book of Omar Khayy\u00e1m (died c. 1131) (L'alg\u00e8bre d'Omar Alkhayy\u00e2m\u00ee, publi\u00e9e, traduite et accompagn\u00e9e d'extraits des manuscrits in\u00e9dits, 1851);[2] an edition of the algebra book of Al-Karkhi (died c. 1029) (Extrait du Fakhr\u00ee, trait\u00e9 d'alg\u00e8bre par Mohammed Alkarkhi, pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d'un m\u00e9moire sur l'alg\u00e8bre ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e chez les Arabes, 1853); lengthy essays on the introduction and propagation of the Hindu-Arabic numerals (Sur l'introduction de l'arithmetique indienne en Occident (1859) and M\u00e9moire sur la propagation des chiffres indiens (1863)); and essays involving the influences of Arabic sources in the mathematics of Leonardo Pisano (died c. 1250).\n Hippolyte Taine dedicated his book De l'intelligence to him and described him as his friend that he had most respected.[3]\n ", "tags": ["1826 births", "1864 deaths", "People from Dessau-Ro\u00dflau", "German orientalists", "19th-century German mathematicians", "German Arabists", "German male non-fiction writers", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Franz Woepcke (May 6, 1826 \u2013 March 25, 1864) was an historian, Orientalist, and mathematician.
