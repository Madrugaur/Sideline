{"name": "Ernst Kummer", "content": "Ernst Eduard Kummer (29 January 1810 \u2013 14 May 1893) was a German mathematician. Skilled in applied mathematics, Kummer trained German army officers in ballistics; afterwards, he taught for 10 years in a gymnasium, the German equivalent of high school, where he inspired the mathematical career of Leopold Kronecker.\n Kummer was born in Sorau, Brandenburg (then part of Prussia). He was awarded a PhD from the University of Halle in 1831 for writing a prize-winning mathematical essay (De cosinuum et sinuum potestatibus secundum cosinus et sinus arcuum multiplicium evolvendis), which was eventually published a year later.\n In 1840, Kummer married Ottilie Mendelssohn, daughter of Nathan Mendelssohn and Henriette Itzig. Ottilie was a cousin of Felix Mendelssohn and his sister Rebecca Mendelssohn Bartholdy, the wife of the mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. His second wife (whom he married soon after the death of Ottilie in 1848), Bertha Cauer, was a maternal cousin of Ottilie. Overall, he had 13 children. His daughter Marie married the mathematician Hermann Schwarz. Kummer retired from teaching and from mathematics in 1890 and died three years later in Berlin.\n Kummer made several contributions to mathematics in different areas; he codified some of the relations between different hypergeometric series, known as contiguity relations. The Kummer surface results from taking the quotient of a two-dimensional abelian variety by the cyclic group {1, \u22121} (an early orbifold: it has 16 singular points, and its geometry was intensively studied in the nineteenth century).\n Kummer also proved Fermat's last theorem for a considerable class of prime exponents (see regular prime, ideal class group). His methods were closer, perhaps, to p-adic ones than to ideal theory as understood later, though the term 'ideal' was invented by Kummer. He studied what were later called Kummer extensions of fields: that is, extensions generated by adjoining an nth root to a field already containing a primitive nth root of unity. This is a significant extension of the theory of quadratic extensions, and the genus theory of quadratic forms (linked to the 2-torsion of the class group). As such, it is still foundational for class field theory.\n Kummer further conducted research in ballistics and, jointly with William Rowan Hamilton he investigated \nray systems.[1]\n ", "tags": ["1810 births", "1893 deaths", "People from \u017bary", "19th-century German mathematicians", "Number theorists", "German Lutherans", "People from the Province of Brandenburg", "Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg alumni", "University of Breslau faculty", "Humboldt University of Berlin faculty", "Technical University of Berlin faculty", "Mendelssohn family", "Members of the French Academy of Sciences", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences", "Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with DSI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "German mathematician\nErnst KummerBornErnst Eduard Kummer(1810-01-29)29 January 1810Sorau, PrussiaDied14 May 1893(1893-05-14) (aged\u00a083)Berlin, Brandenburg, GermanyNationalityPrussianAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Halle (Ph.D., 1831)Known\u00a0forBessel functions, Kummer theory, Kummer surface, and other contributionsScientific careerFieldsMathematicianInstitutionsUniversity of BerlinUniversity of BreslauGewerbeinstitutLomonosov UniversityThesisDe cosinuum et sinuum potestatibus secundum cosinus et sinus arcuum multiplicium evolvendis\u00a0(1831/1832)Doctoral advisorHeinrich ScherkDoctoral studentsGotthold EisensteinGeorg FrobeniusLazarus FuchsWilhelm KillingAdolf KneserFranz MertensHermann SchwarzGeorg CantorHans Carl Friedrich von MangoldtAdolf PiltzFriedrich Prym\n\nErnst Eduard Kummer (29 January 1810 \u2013 14 May 1893) was a German mathematician.
