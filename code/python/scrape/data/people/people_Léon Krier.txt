{"name": "L\u00e9on Krier", "content": "L\u00e9on Krier CVO (born 7 April 1946) is a Luxembourgish architect, architectural theorist and urban planner, a prominent critic of architectural Modernism and advocate\u00a0of New Traditional Architecture and New Urbanism. Krier combines an international architecture & planning practice with writing and teaching. He is well-known for his master plan for Poundbury, in Dorset, England.[1]  He is the younger brother of architect Rob Krier.\n Krier abandoned his architectural studies at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, in 1968, after only one year, to work in the office of architect James Stirling in London, UK. After four years working for Stirling, interrupted by a two years association with Josef Paul Kleihues in Berlin, Krier spent 20 years in England practicing and teaching at the Architectural Association and Royal College of Art. In this period, Krier's statement: \u201cI am an architect, because I don\u2019t build\u201d,[2] became a famous expression of his uncompromising anti-modernist attitude. From the late 1970s onwards he has been one of the most influential modern traditional architects and planners. He is one of the first and most prominent critics of architectural modernism, mainly of its functional zoning and the ensuing suburbanism, campaigning for the reconstruction of the traditional European city model and its growth based on the polycentric city model.\n His ideas had a great influence on the New Urbanism movement, both in the USA and Europe. The most complete compilation of them is published in his book The Architecture of Community.\n He is best known for his masterplan for, and ongoing oversight of, the development of Poundbury, an urban extension to Dorchester, UK for the Duchy of Cornwall and the Prince of Wales; and for his masterplan for Paseo Cayal\u00e1, an extension of four new urban quarters for Guatemala City. From 1976\u20132016 Krier was a visiting professor at the Universities of Princeton, Yale, Virginia, Cornell and Notre Dame. From 1987\u201390 Krier was the first director of the SOMAI, the Skidmore, Owings & Merrill Architectural Institute, in Chicago. Since 1990, Krier has been industrial designer for Valli e Valli - Assa Abloy[3] and Giorgetti,[4] an Italian furniture company.[5] In 2003 Krier became the inaugural Driehaus Architecture Prize laureate.[6]\n Krier acts as architectural consultant on his urban planning projects but only designs buildings of his personal choice. Amongst his best known realizations are the temporary fa\u00e7ade at the 1980 Venice Biennale; the Krier house in the resort village of Seaside, Florida, USA (where he also advised on the masterplan); the Archaeological Museum of S\u00e3o Miguel de Odrinhas, Portugal; the Windsor Village Hall in Florida; the Jorge M. Perez Architecture Center,[7] the University of Miami School of Architecture in Miami,[8] Florida; and the new Neighbourhood Center Citt\u00e0 Nuova in Alessandria, Italy. \n Though Krier is well known for his defense of classical architecture and the reconstruction of traditional \u201cEuropean city\u201d models, close scrutiny of his work[9] in fact shows a shift from an early Modernist rationalist approach (project for University of Bielefeld, 1968) towards a vernacular and classical approach both formally and technologically. The project that marked a major turning point in his campaigning attitude towards the reconstruction of the traditional European city was his scheme (unrealized) for the 'reconstruction' of his home city of Luxembourg (1978), in response to the modernist redevelopment of the city. He later master planned Luxembourg's new Cit\u00e9 Judiciaire that was to be architecturally designed by his brother (1990\u20132008).[10]\n In 1990, of the nine experts invited he was the only one to support the Dresden citizens initiative to reconstruct the historic Dresden Frauenkirche and the Historische Neumarkt area and, in 2007, the Frankfurt Altstadt Forum,[11] citizen initiative which succeeded in reconstructing the historic \"H\u00fchnermarkt\" area against strong professional and political opposition.\n Krier has applied his theories in large-scale, detailed plans for numerous cities in the Western world like the unrealized schemes Kingston upon Hull (1977), Rome (1977), Luxembourg (1978) most comprehensive masterplan focusing on sprawl repair and town center repair, West Berlin (1977\u201383), Bremen (1978\u20131980), Stockholm (1981), Poing Nord, Munich (1983), a masterplan for the completion till the year 2000 of  Washington D.C. (1984) commissioned by the M.O.M.A of New York; Atlantis, an ideal classical town for intellectuals and artists, Tenerife (1987); also in projects for new towns commissioned by developers, like Area Fiat, Novoli, Italy, (1993) and Corbeanca Romania (2007), and by public administrations like the redevelopment of Tor Bella Monaca, a degraded suburb of Rome, (2010) and a long term redevelopment policy plan of the municipal area of Cattolica, Rimini, Italy (2017)[12][13]  and those of High Malton Masterplan for the Fitzwilliam Estate, Yorkshire, U.K. (2014) and the redevelopment of the demised Fawley Waterside Power Station,[14] Southampton, U.K. (2017) in the permitting stage; then in built developments\u00a0like Knokke, Heulebrug Belgium (1998) near completion after Krier\u2019s plan but without his direction; and in his masterplan for Newquay growth area (2002-2006), Cornwall, UK, after his resignation continued by Adam Associates. And the ones he is currently implementing for Poundbury Dorset, U.K. (1988 onwards); Paseo Cayal\u00e1, Guatemala City (2003 onwards); and El Socorro, two new urban quarters for Guatemala City (2018 onwards) and a new town, Herencia de Allende, near San Miguel de Allende, M\u00e9xico (2018 onwards).\n Krier agreed with the viewpoint of the late Heinrich Tessenow that there is a strict relationship between the economic and cultural wealth of a city, on the one hand, and the limitation of its population on the other. But this is not a matter of mere hypothesis, he argues, but historical fact. The measurements and geometric organization of a city and of its quarters are not the result of mere chance or accident or simply of economic necessity, but rather represents a civilizing order which is not only aesthetic and technical but also legislative and ethical.\n Krier claims, that \u201cthe whole of Paris is a pre-industrial city which still works, because it is so adaptable, something the creations of the 20th century will never be. A city like Milton Keynes cannot survive an economic crisis, or any other kind of crisis, because it is planned as a mathematically determined social and economic project. If that model collapses, the city will collapse with it.\u201d Thus Krier argues not merely against the contemporary modernist city (he in fact argues that places like Los Angeles, U.S., are not cities), but against a gigantism tendency in urban growth, evident in the exploding scale of urban networks and buildings in European cities throughout the 19th century which was a result of the concentration of economic, political and cultural power.[15] In response to this, Krier proposed the reconstruction of the European city, based on polycentric settlement models which are dictated not by machine scale but by human scale both horizontally and vertically, of self-sufficient mixed use quarters not exceeding 33 hectares (82 acres) (able to be crossed in 10 minutes walk) of building heights of 3 to 5 floors or 100 steps (able to be walked up comfortably) and which are limited not by mere administrative borders but by walkable, ridable, drivable boulevards, tracks, park ways. Cities then grow by the multiplication of independent urban quarters, not by horizontal or vertical over-extensions of established urban cores.\n Krier has written a number of essays \u2212 many first published in the journal Architectural Design, against modernist town planning and its principle of dividing up the city into a system of single use zones (housing, shopping, industry, leisure, etc.), as well as the resultant suburbia, commuting, etc. Indeed, Krier sees the modernist planner as a tyrannical figure that imposes detrimental megastructural scale more dictated by ideology than necessity.[16]\n Krier summons up his criticisms and pinpoints concepts in the form of series of drawings and didactic annotated diagrams, often in his own handwriting, eventually collected in his book Drawings for Architecture, like the concept of Urban in his 1983 diagram of a truly urban town= RES PUBLICA+RES PRIVATE. There he conceives the basic urban fabric, made of private buildings and uses, as an object of vernacular local design and the exceptional public and institutional buildings as objects of classical architecture and located in privileged sites, on squares and in the focus of major vistas.\n The principle behind Krier\u2019s writings has been to explain the rational foundations of architecture and the city, stating that \u201cIn the language of symbols, there can exist no misunderstanding\u201d. That is to say, for Krier, buildings have a rational order and type: a house, a palace, a temple, a campanile, a church; but also a roof, a column, a window, etc., what he terms \u201cnameable objects\u201d. As projects get bigger, he goes on to argue, the buildings should not get bigger, but divide up; thus, for instance, in his unrealized scheme for a school in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (1978), France, the school became a \u201ccity in miniature\u201d. \n Krier proposes functional programs greatly varied within each block and plot. For him the building\u2019s design should always be typologically or tectonically justified and the variety of building types and volumes should reflect this functional variety in an evident and natural way; in short all gratuitous uniformity or gratuitous variety should be avoided designing neighboring building lots of dimensional, functional and thus formal variety and in such a way as to generate networks of public spaces consisting of public streets, squares, avenues, boulevards, parks. For Krier it is essential to compose at once the harmony of the urban blocks and of the inseparable public spaces generated between them.\n In searching for such a typological architecture, Krier\u2019s work has been termed \u201can architecture without a style\u201d. However, it has also been pointed out that the appearance of his architecture is very much like Roman architecture, which he then places in all his projects, be it central London, Stockholm, Tenerife or Florida.\u201d[17]\n Many of these are available online[18]\n ", "tags": ["Luxembourgian architects", "New Classical architects", "Neohistoricist architects", "Academics of the Royal College of Art", "1946 births", "Living people", "People from Luxembourg City", "Urban theorists", "Luxembourgish urban planners", "New Urbanism", "Driehaus Architecture Prize winners", "21st-century architects", "Articles with hCards", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "L\u00e9on KrierL\u00e9on Krier in Poundbury, Dorchester, UK, 2016Born (1946-04-07) 7 April 1946 (age\u00a074)City of Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of LuxembourgOccupationArchitectAwardsDriehaus Architecture Prize 2003Commander of the Royal Victorian Order\nL\u00e9on Krier CVO (born 7 April 1946) is a Luxembourgish architect, architectural theorist and urban planner, a prominent critic of architectural Modernism and advocate\u00a0of New Traditional Architecture and New Urbanism.
