{"name": "Norman Levinson", "content": "Norman Levinson (August 11, 1912 in Lynn, Massachusetts \u2013 October 10, 1975 in Boston) was an American mathematician.  Some of his major contributions were in the study of Fourier transforms, complex analysis, non-linear differential equations, number theory, and signal processing.  He worked closely with Norbert Wiener in his early career. He joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1937. In 1954, he was awarded the B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize of the American Mathematical Society and in 1971 the Chauvenet Prize (after winning in 1970 the Lester R. Ford Award) of the Mathematical Association of America for his paper A Motivated Account of an Elementary Proof of the Prime Number Theorem.[2] In 1974 he published a paper proving that more than a third of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line, a result later improved to two fifths by Conrey.\n He received both his bachelor's degree and his master's degree in electrical engineering  from MIT in 1934, where he had studied under Norbert Wiener and took almost all of the graduate-level courses in mathematics.  He received the MIT Redfield Proctor Traveling Fellowship to study at the University of Cambridge, with the assurance that MIT would reward him with a Ph.D. upon his return regardless of whatever he produced at Cambridge.   Within the first four months in Cambridge, he had already produced two papers.  In 1935, MIT awarded him with the Ph.D. in mathematics.\n His death in 1975 was caused by a brain tumor. He was married since 1938; his widow Zipporah died at age 93 in 2009, survived by two daughters and four grandchildren. Norman Levinson's doctoral students include Raymond Redheffer and Harold Shapiro.[1]\n ", "tags": ["1912 births", "1975 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Jewish scientists", "MIT School of Engineering alumni", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty", "People from Lynn, Massachusetts", "Mathematicians from Massachusetts", "Number theorists", "Mathematical analysts", "Deaths from brain tumor", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nNorman LevinsonBorn(1912-08-11)11 August 1912Lynn, Massachusetts, USADied10 October 1975(1975-10-10) (aged\u00a063)Boston, Massachusetts, USACitizenshipUSAAlma\u00a0materMITKnown\u00a0forLevinson recursion  Levinson's inequalityAwardsB\u00f4cher Memorial Prize (1953)  Chauvenet Prize (1971)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsThesisOn the Non-Vanishing of a Function[1]Doctoral advisorNorbert Wiener[1]Doctoral studentsRaymond RedhefferHarold S.
