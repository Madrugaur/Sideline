His father, Ferdinand Lindemann, taught modern languages at a Gymnasium in Hanover.  His mother, Emilie Crusius, was the daughter of the Gymnasium's headmaster.

At Erlangen he received a doctorate, supervised by Felix Klein,[1] on non-Euclidean geometry. Lindemann subsequently taught in W\u00fcrzburg and at the University of Freiburg. During his time in Freiburg, Lindemann devised his proof that \u03c0 is a transcendental number (see Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem). After his time in Freiburg, Lindemann transferred to the University of K\u00f6nigsberg.
