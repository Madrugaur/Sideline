Pope\u2019s partnership with Edison ended shortly after it was formed.[3]\n Pope was awarded several patents for his work in railroad semaphore lock signal systems, the most important of which was his 1872 invention for the rail circuit for automatic control of the electric-block signal system, which was widely used by the major U.S. railways. Pope was president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1886 to 1887.[4]\n Pope was an editor of the magazine Electrical Engineer, and edited the electrical section of The Engineering Magazine. Pope also worked as a patent attorney for Western Union Telegraph Company, and was retained as an expert in many important patent suits.\n Pope married Sarah Amelia Dickinson on 6 August 1873, and they had three children; two daughters and a son.\n Pope died at age 54 as a result of an accidental electrocution by 3000 volts in the basement of his home at 518 main street in Great Barrington.
