{"name": "David Emmanuel (mathematician)", "content": "David Emmanuel (31 January 1854 \u2013 4 February 1941) was a Romanian Jewish mathematician and member of the Romanian Academy, considered to be the founder of the modern mathematics school in Romania.\n Born in Bucharest, Emmanuel studied at Gheorghe Laz\u0103r and Gheorghe \u0218incai high schools. In 1873 he went to Paris, where he received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Paris (Sorbonne) in 1879 with a thesis on Study of abelian integrals of the third species, becoming the second Romanian to have a Ph.D. in mathematics from the Sorbonne (the first one was Spiru Haret). The thesis defense committee consisted of Victor Puiseux (advisor), Charles Briot, and Jean-Claude Bouquet.[1]\n In 1882, Emmanuel became a professor of superior algebra and function theory at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Bucharest. Here, in 1888, he held the first courses on group theory and on Galois theory, and introduced set theory in Romanian education.[2] Among his students were Anton Davidoglu, Alexandru Froda, Traian Lalescu, Grigore Moisil, Alexandru Myller\u00a0[ro], Miron Nicolescu, Octav Onicescu, Dimitrie Pompeiu, Simion Stoilow, and Gheorghe \u021ai\u021beica. Emmanuel had an important role in the introduction of modern mathematics and of the rigorous approach to mathematics in Romania.\n Emmanuel was the president of the first Congress of Romanian Mathematicians, held in 1929 in Cluj. He died in Bucharest in 1941. \n A street in the Doroban\u021bi neighborhood of Bucharest is named after him.\n ", "tags": ["1854 births", "1941 deaths", "Scientists from Bucharest", "Romanian Sephardi Jews", "Gheorghe Laz\u0103r National College (Bucharest) alumni", "University of Paris alumni", "Romanian mathematicians", "Romanian academics", "University of Bucharest faculty", "Honorary members of the Romanian Academy", "Mathematical analysts", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 Romanian-language sources (ro)", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "David EmmanuelBorn(1854-01-31)January 31, 1854Bucharest, WallachiaDiedFebruary 4, 1941(1941-02-04) (aged\u00a087)Bucharest, Kingdom of RomaniaNationalityRomanianAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ParisKnown\u00a0forFounder of modern mathematics school in RomaniaScientific careerFieldsMathematicianThesis\u00c9tude des int\u00e9grales abstraites du troisi\u00e8me esp\u00e8ce\u00a0(1879)Doctoral advisorVictor PuiseuxNotable studentsTraian LalescuSimion StoilowGheorghe \u021ai\u021beica\n\nDavid Emmanuel (31 January 1854 \u2013 4 February 1941) was a Romanian Jewish mathematician and member of the Romanian Academy, considered to be the founder of the modern mathematics school in Romania.\nBorn in Bucharest, Emmanuel studied at Gheorghe Laz\u0103r and Gheorghe \u0218incai high schools.
