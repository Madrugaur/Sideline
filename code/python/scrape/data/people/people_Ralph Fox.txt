{"name": "Ralph Fox", "content": "\n Ralph Hartzler Fox (March 24, 1913\u00a0\u2013 December 23, 1973) was an American mathematician. As a professor at Princeton University, he taught and advised many of the contributors to the Golden Age of differential topology, and he played an important role in the modernization and main-streaming of knot theory.\n Ralph Fox attended Swarthmore College for two years, while studying piano at the Leefson Conservatory of Music in Philadelphia. He earned a master's degree from Johns Hopkins University, and a Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1939. His doctoral dissertation, On the Lusternick-Schnirelmann Category, was directed by Solomon Lefschetz. (In later years he disclaimed all knowledge of Lusternik\u2013Schnirelmann category, and certainly never published on the subject again.) He directed 21 doctoral dissertations, including those of John Milnor, John Stallings, Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez-Acu\u00f1a, Guillermo Torres-Diaz and Barry Mazur.\n He was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[1] His mathematical contributions include Fox n-coloring of knots, the Fox-Artin arc, and the free differential calculus.  He also identified the compact-open topology on function spaces as being particularly appropriate for homotopy theory.\n Aside from his strictly mathematical contributions, he was responsible for introducing several basic phrases to knot theory: the phrases slice knot, ribbon knot, and Seifert circle all appear in print for the first time under his name, and he also popularized (if he did not introduce) the phrase Seifert surface.\n He popularized the playing of the game of Go at both Princeton and the Institute for Advanced Study.\n ", "tags": ["1913 births", "1973 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars", "Topologists", "Princeton University faculty", "Swarthmore College alumni", "People from Morrisville, Pennsylvania", "Mathematicians from Pennsylvania", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use American English from November 2019", "All Wikipedia articles written in American English", "Use mdy dates from November 2019", "Articles with hCards", "CS1: long volume value", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician\nThis article is about the American mathematician.
