{"name": "James Newlands", "content": "\n James Newlands (28 July 1813 \u2013 15 July 1871) was a Scottish civil engineer who worked in Liverpool as the first Borough Engineer appointed in the United Kingdom, and is credited with designing and implementing the first integrated sewerage system in the world in 1848.[1][2]\n Newlands was born in Edinburgh, the third of nine children of Janet Mckay and Thomas Newlands, a ropemaker. He attended Edinburgh High School, and then  studied mathematics and natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. He also became an accomplished draughtsman and was trained as a musician, playing the flute and piano.[3][4] Newlands became apprenticed (c. 1827) to Edinburgh Corporation architect, Thomas Brown, and then worked for Professor Low of the University's school of agriculture,[5] during which time he illustrated Low's book Elements of Practical Agriculture, was involved in the design of farm buildings, and produced agricultural models. He received additional training in chemistry, mathematics and mechanics, and wrote copiously for Encyclopaedia Britannica and other publications. In 1847 he designed the Johnston's Free School in Kirkcudbright in Galloway, Scotland.[6][7] He married in 1845, [8] but was widowed in 1848 and never remarried,[3] living in his later years with his sister, Jessie.\n Newlands was one of a celebrated trio of pioneering officers appointed under a private Act, the Liverpool Sanatory Act by the Borough of Liverpool Health of Towns Committee. The other officers appointed under the Act were William Henry Duncan, Medical Officer for Health, and Thomas Fresh, Inspector of Nuisances (an early antecedent of the environmental health officer). One of five applicants for the post, Newlands was appointed Borough Engineer of Liverpool on 26 January 1847. He was paid a salary of \u00a3700, plus a horse and 'vehicle'.\n In his first year, he made a careful and exact survey of Liverpool and its surroundings, involving somewhere about 3,000 geodetical observations, and resulting in the construction of a contour map of the town and its environs, on a scale of one inch to 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m). From this elaborate survey Newlands proceeded to lay down a comprehensive system of outlet and contributory sewers, and main and subsidiary drains, to an aggregate extent of nearly 300 miles (480\u00a0km). The details of this projected system he presented to the Corporation in April 1848.\n In July 1848, ten years before London began its similar endeavours following the Great Stink, James Newlands' sewer construction programme began, and over the next 11 years 86 miles (138\u00a0km) of new sewers were built. Between 1856 and 1862 another 58 miles (93\u00a0km) were added. This programme was completed in 1869. Before the sewers were built, life expectancy in Liverpool was 19 years, and by the time Newlands retired it had more than doubled.\n During the Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u201355), the British government wrote to the Mayor and Corporation of Liverpool, asking that Newlands might be permitted to vacate his post and proceed to the Crimea as Sanitary Commissioner, to assist in relieving the 'pestilence' which was contributing to the high casualties among British and allied forces. Florence Nightingale later wrote to him, saying \"Truly I may say that to us sanitary salvation came from Liverpool.\"\n Newlands was an early proponent for a ring-road serving Liverpool (not realised for another 50 years, when Queens Drive was constructed by his successor as borough engineer, John Alexander Brodie). In addition to his sewerage projects, he also worked extensively on Liverpool's highways, designed the Cornwallis Street and Margaret Street Baths, and improved the city's lighting.[9]\n Newlands wrote several books, and was a contributor to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. He was also an accomplished musician and artist, creating several hundred sketches. Several of his paintings were exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy. After long bouts of ill-health, he died in Liverpool in 1871, aged 57, shortly after his retirement as borough engineer.\n There is a plaque to James Newlands in Abercromby Square, Liverpool, erected by the Institution of Civil Engineers in 2007.\n ", "tags": ["People from Edinburgh", "1813 births", "1871 deaths", "Alumni of the University of Edinburgh", "Local government officers in England", "British civil engineers", "Sewerage infrastructure", "Engineers from Liverpool", "19th-century Scottish architects", "Architects from Edinburgh", "Sanitary commissioners", "Use dmy dates from November 2017", "Use British English from November 2017", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nJames NewlandsBornJames Newlands(1813-07-28)July 28, 1813Edinburgh, ScotlandDiedJuly 15, 1871(1871-07-15) (aged\u00a057)Liverpool, EnglandNationalityScottishOccupationCivil engineerYears\u00a0active1827 - c.1871Notable workLiverpool sewerage systemParentsThomas Newlands (father)Janet McKay (mother)\nJames Newlands (28 July 1813 \u2013 15 July 1871) was a Scottish civil engineer who worked in Liverpool as the first Borough Engineer appointed in the United Kingdom, and is credited with designing and implementing the first integrated sewerage system in the world in 1848.[1][2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n2 Liverpool\n3 Legacy\n4 Bibliography\n\n4.1 References\n\n\n\n\nEarly life[edit]\n Johnston's Free School, Kirkcudbright\nNewlands was born in Edinburgh, the third of nine children of Janet Mckay and Thomas Newlands, a ropemaker.
