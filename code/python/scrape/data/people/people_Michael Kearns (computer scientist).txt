{"name": "Michael Kearns (computer scientist)", "content": "Michael Kearns is an American computer scientist, professor and National Center Chair at the University of Pennsylvania, the founding director of Penn's Singh Program in Networked & Social Systems Engineering (NETS), the founding director of  Warren Center for Network and Data Sciences, and also holds secondary appointments in Penn's Wharton School and department of Economics. He is a leading researcher in computational learning theory and algorithmic game theory, and interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, computational finance, algorithmic trading, computational social science and social networks.[1] He leads the Advisory and Research function in Morgan Stanley's Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence team.[2]\n Kearns was born into an academic family, where his father David R Kearns is Professor Emeritus at University of California, San Diego in chemistry, who won Guggenheim Fellowship in 1969,[3] and his uncle Thomas R. Kearns is Professor Emeritus at Amherst College in Philosophy and Law, Jurisprudence, and Social Thought. His paternal grandfather Clyde W. Kearns was a pioneer  in insecticide toxicology and was a professor at University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign in Entomology,[4] and his maternal grandfather Chen Shou-Yi (1899\u20131978) was a professor at Pomona College in history and literature, who was born in Canton (Guangzhou, China) into a family noted for their scholarship and educational leadership.[5] In the growth and development of Asian Studies on the West Coast, the Claremont Colleges and Professor Chen occupy a leading place.
