{"name": "Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s", "content": "Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s, sometimes referred to as the Elder (23 October 1695, Soignies, Hainaut \u2014 14 April 1768, Munich), was a Belgian-born Bavarian  decorative designer and architect. He was instrumental in bringing the Rococo style to the Wittelsbach court at Munich and to Central Europe in general.\n Cuvilli\u00e9s was so diminutive in stature that it was as a court dwarf that he first came to the notice of the then-exiled Max Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria,[1]  who detected the young dwarf's aptitude and had him tutored in mathematics, then underwrote his further education with Joseph Effner and sent him to Paris from 1720\u201324, where he trained in the atelier of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel,[2] On his return to Munich, he was appointed court architect, at first in conjunction with Effner.\n At the Elector's death in 1726, for a time Cuvilli\u00e9s worked at Schloss Br\u00fchl for the new Elector's brother, Clemens August of Bavaria. He provided designs for the chapel at Br\u016bhl, (1730\u201340) and the hunting lodge Falkenlust (1729\u201340) but as Charles Albert's interests shifted to Munich, he also returned to Munich. There his fame was established by the decors of the Reiche Zimmer in the Munich Residenz, which had been damaged by a fire, 14 December 1729. The contents of the Schatzkammer fortunately had been spared, and Cuvilli\u00e9s was commissioned to design the panelling of a new interior, to be executed by the court's premier carver Joachim Dietrich.[3] with four rococo gilded console tables on scrolling legs with playful dragons.[4]\n His masterpiece is the Amalienburg in the park at Nymphenburg, built 1734-39, with silvered or gilded naturalist Rococo decorations set off by coloured grounds. As the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica commented, \"his style, while essentially thin, is often painfully elaborate and bizarre. He designed mirrors and consoles, balustrades for staircases, ceilings and fireplaces, and in furniture, beds and commodes especially\".\n The Residenztheater, or \"Cuvilli\u00e9s Theatre\", (1751\u20131755) was designed and constructed for Elector Max III Joseph by Cuvilli\u00e9es. Though the theatre was bombed during World War II, the carved and gilded boxes had been dismantled and stored for security. Afterwards, the Residenztheatre was meticulously recreated in the 1950s.\n He wrote several treatises on artistic and decorative subjects, which were edited by his son, Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s the Younger, who succeeded his father at the court of Munich. From 1738 he embarked on his lifelong series of suites of engravings of wall-panelling, cornices, furniture and wrought-iron work, which were then published in Munich and distributed in Paris and doubtless elsewhere;[5] they served to disseminate the Rococo throughout Europe.\n His son Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s the Younger (* 24 October 1731 in Munich; \u2020 10 January 1777 there) was also an architect and an assistant to his father. After the death of the latter, he became a deputy master-builder to the Electoral court at Munich. His work at first was in his father's Rococo style, but later led to Neoclassicism.\n \n ", "tags": ["18th-century German architects", "Architects of the Bavarian court", "People with dwarfism", "1698 births", "1767 deaths", "People from Soignies", "Architects from Munich", "Rococo architects", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers", "Use dmy dates from March 2017"], "raw": "Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s, sometimes referred to as the Elder (23 October 1695, Soignies, Hainaut \u2014 14 April 1768, Munich), was a Belgian-born Bavarian  decorative designer and architect.
