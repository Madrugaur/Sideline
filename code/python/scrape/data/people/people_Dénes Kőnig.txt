{"name": "D\u00e9nes K\u0151nig", "content": "D\u00e9nes K\u0151nig (September 21, 1884 \u2013 October 19, 1944) was a Hungarian mathematician of Jewish heritage who worked in and wrote the first textbook on the field of graph theory.\n K\u0151nig was born in Budapest, the son of mathematician Gyula K\u0151nig. In 1907, he received his doctorate[1] at, and joined the faculty of the Royal Joseph University in Budapest (today Budapest University of Technology and Economics). His classes were visited by Paul Erd\u0151s, who, as a first year student, solved one of his problems. K\u0151nig became a full professor there in 1935.[1] To honor his fathers' death in 1913, K\u0151nig and his brother Gy\u00f6rgy created the Gyula K\u0151nig prize in 1918.[1] This prize was meant to be an endowment for young mathematicians, however was later devaluated. But the prize remained as a medal of high scientific recognition. In 1899, he published his first work while still attending High School[1] in a journal Matematikai \u00e9s Fizikai Lapok. After his graduation in 1902, he won first place in a mathematical competition \"E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd\".[1]  Shortly after he wrote the first of two book collections Matematikai Mulats\u00e1gok (Mathematical Entertainments). He spent four semesters at the university in Budapest and his last five in G\u00f6ttingen, during which he studied under the famous mathematicians J\u00f3zsef K\u00fcrsch\u00e1k and Hermann Minkowski. He then received his doctorate [1] in 1907 due to his dissertation in geometry, that same year he began working for the Technische Hochschule in Budapest and remained a part of the faculty till his death in 1944. At first he started as an assistant in problem sessions, in 1910 he was promoted to \"oberassistant\",[1] and then promoted to \"Privatdocent\" [1] in 1911 teaching nomography, analysis situs (later to be known as topology), set theory, real numbers and functions, and graph theory (the name \"graph theory\" didn't appear in the university catalogue until 1927). During this time he would be a guest speaker giving mathematics lecture for architecture and chemistry students, in 1920 these lectures made their way into book form.[1] at the Technische Hochschule.\n From 1915 to 1942 he was on a committee to judge school contests in mathematics, collecting problems for these contests, and organizing them.[1] Then in 1933 he was elected as secretary of the society [1] and in 1942 he became the chairman of this committee.[1]  He then decided to make edits in the society's journal during his time on the committee till his death.\n K\u0151nig's activities and lectures played a vital role in the growth of graph theoretical work of: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Egyed, Paul Erd\u0151s, Tibor Gallai, Gy\u00f6rgy Haj\u00f3s, J\u00f3zsef Kraus, Tibor Szele, P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n, Endre V\u00e1zsonyi, and many others.[1] He went on to write the first book on graph theory Theorie der endlichen und unendlichen Graphen in 1936.[1]  This marked the beginning of graph theory as its own branch of mathematics. Then in 1958, Claude Berge wrote the second book on graph theory, Th\u00e9orie des Graphes et ses applications,[1] following K\u0151nig.\n After the occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany, he worked to help persecuted mathematicians. On October 15, 1944 the National Socialist Arrow Cross Party took over the country.  Days later on October 19, 1944 he committed suicide to evade persecution from the Nazis for being a Hungarian Jew.[1]\n The D\u00e9nes K\u00f6nig Prize is a prize established and given by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Activity Group on Discrete Mathematics to an early career researcher for outstanding research in an area of discrete mathematics. The first award was given in 2008, and it had been given biennially thereafter.[2] The award is named after D\u00e9nes K\u0151nig, a Hungarian mathematician who was an earlier pioneer of discrete mathematics.\n ", "tags": ["1884 births", "1944 suicides", "Jewish scientists", "20th-century Hungarian mathematicians", "Graph theorists", "Suicides in Hungary", "Austro-Hungarian mathematicians", "Mathematics awards", "Suicides by Jews during the Holocaust", "Articles with short description", "Short description is different from Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Hungarian mathematician (1884-1944)\nD\u00e9nes K\u0151nigBorn(1884-09-21)September 21, 1884Budapest, Austria-HungaryDiedOctober 19, 1944(1944-10-19) (aged\u00a060)Budapest, Kingdom of HungaryNationalityKingdom of HungaryAlma\u00a0materTechnical University of BudapestScientific careerFieldsMathematicsInstitutionsTechnical University of BudapestDoctoral advisor\nJ\u00f3zsef K\u00fcrsch\u00e1k\nHermann Minkowski\nDoctoral studentsTibor Gallai\n\nD\u00e9nes K\u0151nig (September 21, 1884 \u2013 October 19, 1944) was a Hungarian mathematician of Jewish heritage who worked in and wrote the first textbook on the field of graph theory.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Accomplishments\n3 D\u00e9nes K\u00f6nig Prize\n\n3.1 Past award recipients\n\n\n4 Bibliography\n5 See also\n6 Notes\n7 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nK\u0151nig was born in Budapest, the son of mathematician Gyula K\u0151nig.
