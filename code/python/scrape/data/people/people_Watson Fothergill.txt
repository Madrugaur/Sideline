{"name": "Watson Fothergill", "content": "\n Watson Fothergill (12 July 1841 \u2013 6 March 1928) was a British architect[1] who designed over 100 unique buildings in Nottingham in the East Midlands of England, his influences were mainly from the Gothic Revival and Old English vernacular architecture styles.\n His work dates from 1864 (when he set himself up in practice) to around 1912. His earliest surviving known building dates from 1866.\n Born Fothergill Watson in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire in 1841, he was the son of wealthy Nottingham Lace merchant Robert Watson and Mary Ann Fothergill. He changed his name to Watson Fothergill in 1892 to continue his maternal family name.\n He married Anne Hage in 1867[2] at St. John's Church, Mansfield.[3] They had the following children:\n His father-in-law was Samuel Hage,[2] one of the founding partners of Mansfield Brewery.\n His half-brother was Robert Mackie Watson, chairman of the Mansfield Improvement Commission and the Brunts' Charity.[citation needed]\n In 1856, he entered the St Peter\u2019s Gate office of Frederick Jackson, an architect and surveyor in Nottingham. In mid 1860 he moved as assistant to Isaac Charles Gilbert who was based in Clinton Street, Nottingham. After spending around 18 months with Gilbert, he moved in early 1862 to join the office of Arthur William Blomfield in London. In 1864 he was working with John Middleton in Cheltenham, but in the same year, left to set up his own office at 6 Clinton Street, Nottingham.[4] He remained at Clinton Street until it was demolished by the works in connection with the arrival of the Great Central Railway in 1894. He moved to a new temporary office at 18 George Street, and arranged to rebuild 15 George Street opposite which he completed the next year and moved in on 12 December 1895.\n He was in partnership with Lawrence George Summers from 1880 and he retired in 1912.\n He is credited as having had a great impact on the architecture of the major British industrial city of Nottingham, and designed over a hundred buildings in the city, from offices, banks and warehouses, to churches and private dwelling houses. His easily recognisable style includes the use of contrasting horizontal bands of red and blue brick, dark timber eaves and balconies, and elaborate turrets and stone carving.\n On his death in 1928, he left an estate valued at \u00a373,908 5s 11d[5] (equivalent to \u00a34,490,000 in 2019).[6]\n List of major works[4]\n All Nottinghamshire unless otherwise stated.\n 1860s\n 1870s\n 1880s\n 1890s\n 1900s\n Watson Fothergill's office at 15\u201317 George Street, Nottingham\n Statue (by Nathaniel Hitch) on the frontage of Watson Fothergill's office\n Villa at Bridgegate in Retford\n Houses and Shops at Castle Road in Nottingham\n Banking House at Kirkgate in Newark\n Eight Ladies Homes at Sherwood Rise in Nottingham\n Woodborough Road Baptist Chapel\n Queen\u2019s Chambers at Long Row and King Street in Nottingham\n Carlton Laundry\n Castle Court, Castle Boulevard\n Rose of England public house, Mansfield Road, Nottingham\n Black Boy Hotel, Long Row, Nottingham\n ", "tags": ["1841 births", "1928 deaths", "People from Mansfield", "Architects from Nottinghamshire", "CS1: Julian\u2013Gregorian uncertainty", "Use British English from September 2014", "Use dmy dates from September 2014", "Articles with hCards", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from December 2015", "Commons link from Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nWatson FothergillTitle above the door of the Watson Fothergill offices at 15 George Street, NottinghamBorn(1841-07-12)July 12, 1841Linden, Chesterfield Road, MansfieldDiedMarch 6, 1928(1928-03-06) (aged\u00a086)7 Mapperley Road, NottinghamOther\u00a0namesFothergill WatsonOccupationArchitectSpouse(s)Ann HagePracticeAssociated architectural firm[s]BuildingsNottingham and Nottinghamshire Bank, Thurland Street, Nottingham\n\nWatson Fothergill (12 July 1841 \u2013 6 March 1928) was a British architect[1] who designed over 100 unique buildings in Nottingham in the East Midlands of England, his influences were mainly from the Gothic Revival and Old English vernacular architecture styles.\nHis work dates from 1864 (when he set himself up in practice) to around 1912.
