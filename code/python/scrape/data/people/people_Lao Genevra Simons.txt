When Simons was six months old, her family moved west to New Jersey.[1]\n Upon retiring from Hunter College, Simons founded a $1000 scholarship for the university named after the mathematics honour society, Pi Mu Epsilon. A second graduate scholarship was created in her name, funded by friends, alumnae, and admirers, in the same year.[2]\n Simons died on November 25, 1949 in Greenwich, Connecticut at age 79 of natural causes.[1][2]\n As a child, Simons attended school in New Jersey. She later obtained a teaching certificate from the College for the Training of Teachers at Columbia University and later studied astronomy and mathematics for a year at Vassar College.[3]\n Simons earned a bachelor of science in 1908 from Columbia University; she attained a master\u2019s degree and a Ph.D. also from Columbia in 1912 and 1924 respectively.[3] Her Ph.D. was obtained with a major in education and a minor in mathematics. Simons' doctoral thesis was entitled Introduction of algebra into American schools in the eighteenth century.[4]\n After obtaining her teaching certificate she taught at a preparatory school in Connecticut, then taught elementary school for a year in South Orange, New Jersey.[3]\n Simons was hired at a mathematics professor at Hunter College in 1895. This appointment did not require a bachelor's degree, which Simons did not have at the time of her initial hiring. In 1916, she became an assistant professor and in 1925, she became an associate professor. Simons would later be promoted to professor and head of the mathematics department at Hunter College in 1928.[2]\n At Hunter College, Simons was Chairman of Student Activities from 1934, when the committee was initially founded, until 1940.[2] Simons taught elective courses in mathematics, including advanced classes in pure mathematics and classes in the history of mathematics, in addition to required classes; Simons was one of the first mathematics professors at Hunter to do so. Simons worked at Hunter College until her retirement in 1940.[3]\n Simons was elected a member of the American Mathematical Society in September 1923.[5] Simons was also a member of the Council of The History of Science Society.[6] As part of the Council, Simons was part of the committee on arrangements for the meeting and exhibition commemorating the bi-centenary of the death of Sir Isaac Newton.[7]\n Simons wrote articles about math history for Scripta Mathematica, The Mathematics Teacher, and the American Mathematical Monthly.
