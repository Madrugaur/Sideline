As a freshman at Fort Valley State College in 1957, Knight was studying home economics when the Sputnik launch created a big push for more American students to become educated in mathematics and the sciences. Knight transferred to mathematics, \"because it had fewer labs than any of the sciences\", and graduated in 1961.[3][1][2]\n She completed a master's degree in 1963 at Atlanta University, under the supervision of Abdulalim A. Shabazz,\nand took a teaching position at the Hampton Institute, also becoming an NSF fellow, a position that allowed her to travel and meet with other college mathematics teachers. In 1966, she returned to graduate school, and completed a doctorate in mathematics education in 1970 at the University of Maryland, College Park under the supervision of Henry H. Walbesser.[3][1][2]\n Returning from her doctorate, Knight remained at the Hampton Institute, where she became chair of mathematics and computer science.[4] In 1985 she moved to Coppin State College as a full professor.[1][2] She retired in 2006.\n In 1980, the Virginia Council of Teachers of Mathematics named Knight as their College Teacher of the Year.[5]\nIn 1993 she was named Maryland Mathematics Teacher of the Year, and the Mathematical Association of America gave Knight a Distinguished Teaching Award.[4]\nIn 1996 the University System of Maryland named her as that year's Wilson H.
