{"name": "William Feller", "content": "William \"Vilim\" Feller (July 7, 1906 \u2013 January 14, 1970), born Vilibald Sre\u0107ko Feller, was a Croatian-American mathematician specializing in probability theory.\n Feller was born in Zagreb to Ida Oemichen-Perc, a Croatian-Austrian Catholic, and Eugen Viktor Feller, son of a Polish-Jewish father (David Feller) and an Austrian mother (Elsa Holzer).[1]\n Eugen Feller was a famous chemist and created Elsa fluid named after his mother. According to Gian-Carlo Rota, Eugen Feller's surname was a \"Slavic tongue twister\", which William changed at the age of twenty.[2] This claim appears to be false. His forename, Vilibald, was chosen by his Catholic mother for the saint day of his birthday.[3]\n Feller held a docent position at the University of Kiel beginning in 1928. Because he refused to sign a Nazi oath,[4] he fled the Nazis and went to Copenhagen, Denmark in 1933. He also lectured in Sweden (Stockholm and Lund).[5] As a refugee in Sweden, Feller reported being troubled by increasing fascism at the universities. He reported that the mathematician Torsten Carleman would offer his opinion that Jews and foreigners should be executed.[6]\n Finally, in 1939 he arrived in the U.S. where he became a citizen in 1944 and was on the faculty at Brown and Cornell. In 1950 he became a professor at Princeton University.\n The works of Feller are contained in 104 papers and two books on a variety of topics such as mathematical analysis, theory of measurement, functional analysis, geometry, and differential equations in addition to his work in mathematical statistics and probability.\n Feller was one of the greatest probabilists of the twentieth century, who is remembered for his championing of probability theory as a branch of mathematical analysis in Sweden and the United States. In the middle of the 20th century, probability theory was popular in France and Russia, while mathematical statistics was more popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, according to the Swedish statistician, Harald Cram\u00e9r.[7] His two-volume textbook on probability theory and its applications was called \"the most successful treatise on probability ever written\" by Gian-Carlo Rota.[8]  By stimulating his colleagues and students in Sweden and then in the United States, Feller helped establish research groups studying the analytic theory of probability. In his research, Feller contributed to the study of the relationship between Markov chains and differential equations, where his theory of generators of one-parameter semigroups of stochastic processes gave rise to the theory of \"Feller operators\".\n Numerous topics relating to probability are named after him, including  Feller processes, Feller's explosion test, Feller\u2013Brown movement,  and the Lindeberg\u2013Feller theorem. Feller made fundamental contributions to renewal theory, Tauberian theorems, random walks, diffusion processes, and the law of the iterated logarithm. Feller was among those early editors who launched the journal Mathematical Reviews.\n Feller won the National Medal of Science in 1969.[citation needed]\nHe was president of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.[citation needed]\n In 1949, he was named a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.[11] He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1980.[12]\n ", "tags": ["1906 births", "1970 deaths", "20th-century American mathematicians", "20th-century Croatian people", "Croatian mathematicians", "Presidents of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics", "Probability theorists", "Brown University faculty", "Cornell University faculty", "Princeton University faculty", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb alumni", "National Medal of Science laureates", "Croatian refugees", "American people of Polish-Jewish descent", "Croatian Austro-Hungarians", "Croatian people of Austrian descent", "Croatian people of Polish-Jewish descent", "Scientists from Zagreb", "Yugoslav emigrants to the United States", "Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences", "Fellows of the American Statistical Association", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Biography with signature", "Articles with hCards", "Articles needing additional references from January 2018", "All articles needing additional references", "All articles with unsourced statements", "Articles with unsourced statements from November 2020", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "Croatian-American mathematician\nNot to be confused with William Fellner.\nWilliam FellerBornVilibald Sre\u0107ko FellerJuly 7, 1906\u00a0(1906-07-07)Zagreb, Austro-Hungarian Monarchy (now Croatia)DiedJanuary 14, 1970\u00a0(1970-01-15) (aged\u00a063)New York, New York, USNationalityCroatian\u2013AmericanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of ZagrebUniversity of G\u00f6ttingenKnown\u00a0forFeller processFeller's coin-tossing constantsFeller-continuous processProof by intimidationStars and barsAwardsNational Medal of Science (USA) in Mathematical, Statistical, and Computational Sciences (1969)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicianInstitutionsUniversity of Kiel University of Copenhagen University of Stockholm University of Lund Brown UniversityCornell UniversityPrinceton UniversityDoctoral advisorRichard CourantDoctoral studentsPatrick BillingsleyGeorge ForsytheRobert KurtzHenry McKeanLawrence SheppHale TrotterBenjamin WeissDavid A.
