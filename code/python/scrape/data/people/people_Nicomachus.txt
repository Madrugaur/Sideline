{"name": "Nicomachus", "content": "Nicomachus of Gerasa[1] (Greek: \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2; c. 60 \u2013 c. 120 AD) was an important ancient mathematician best known for his works Introduction to Arithmetic and Manual of Harmonics in Greek. He was born in Gerasa, in the Roman province of Syria (now Jerash, Jordan). He was a Neopythagorean, who wrote about the mystical properties of numbers.[2][3]\n Little is known about the life of Nicomachus except that he was a Pythagorean who came from Gerasa. Historians consider him a Neopythagorean based on his tendency to view the numbers having mystical properties.[2][3] The age in which he lived (c. 100 AD) is only known because he mentions Thrasyllus in his Manual of Harmonics, and because his Introduction to Arithmetic was apparently translated into Latin in the mid 2nd century by Apuleius.[4] His Manual of Harmonics was addressed to a lady of noble birth, at whose request Nicomachus wrote the book, which suggests that he was a respected scholar of some status.[4] He mentions his intent to write a more advanced work, and how the journeys he frequently undertakes leave him short of time.[4]\n Introduction to Arithmetic (\u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae, Arithmetike eisagoge), the lesser work on arithmetic. As a Neo-Pythagorean, Nicomachus was often more interested in the mystical properties of numbers rather than their mathematical properties.[2][3] According to Henrietta O. Midonick (1965), he distinguishes between the wholly conceptual immaterial number, which he regards as the 'divine number', and the numbers which measure material things, the 'scientific' number.[4][5] He writes extensively on numbers, especially on the significance of prime numbers and perfect numbers and argues that arithmetic is ontologically prior to the other mathematical sciences (music, geometry, and astronomy), and is their cause.  Boethius' De institutione arithmetica is in large part a Latin translation of this work.\nHowever Introduction of Arithmetic does contain quite elementary errors which show that Nicomachus chose not to give proofs of his results because he did not in general have such proofs. Many of the results were known by Nicomachus to be true since they appeared with proofs in Euclid, although in a geometrical formulation. Sometimes Nicomachus states a result which is simply false and then illustrates it with an example that happens to have the properties described in the result. We can deduce from this that some of the results are merely guesses based on the evidence of the numerical examples.\n Although he was preceded by the Babylonians and the Chinese,[6] Nicomachus provided one of the earliest Greco-Roman multiplication tables, whereas the oldest extant Greek multiplication table is found on a wax tablet dated to the 1st century AD (now found in the British Museum).[7]\n Manuale Harmonicum (\u1f18\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f01\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1fc6\u03c2, Encheiridion Harmonikes). This is the first important music theory treatise since the time of Aristoxenus and Euclid.  It provides the earliest surviving record of the legend of Pythagoras's epiphany outside a smithy that pitch is determined by numeric ratios.  Nicomachus also gives the first in-depth account of the relationship between music and the ordering of the universe via the \"music of the spheres.\"  Nicomachus's discussion of the governance of the ear and voice in understanding music unites Aristoxenian and Pythagorean concerns, normally regarded as antitheses.[8]  In the midst of theoretical discussions, Nicomachus also describes the instruments of his time, also providing a valuable resource.  In addition to the Manual, ten extracts survive from what appear to have originally been a more substantial work on music.\n The works which are lost are:\n ", "tags": ["60 births", "120 deaths", "1st-century philosophers", "1st-century Greek people", "2nd-century Greek people", "Ancient Greek mathematicians", "Neo-Pythagoreans", "People from Jerash", "Pythagoreans", "Roman-era philosophers", "Ancient Greek music theorists", "2nd-century writers", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text", "Articles containing Greek-language text", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLG identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SELIBR identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Greco-Syrian mathematician (c. 60 \u2013 c. 120 AD)\nFor other people named Nicomachus, see Nicomachus (disambiguation).\n Plato (left) and Nicomachus (right), as inventors of music, from a 12th-century manuscript\nNicomachus of Gerasa[1] (Greek: \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2; c. 60 \u2013 c. 120 AD) was an important ancient mathematician best known for his works Introduction to Arithmetic and Manual of Harmonics in Greek.

There is an extant work sometimes attributed to Iamblichus under this title written two centuries later which contains a great deal of material thought to have been copied or paraphrased from Nicomachus' work.\nA Life of Pythagoras (per Iamblichus), one of the main sources used by Porphyry and Iamblichus, for their (extant) Lives of Pythagoras.\nA collection of Pythagorean dogmata, referred to by Iamblichus.\nOn Egyptian festivals (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f11\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd), is mentioned by Athenaeus, but whether by this Nicomachus is uncertain.\nSee also[edit]\nMonad\nDyad\nTriad\nTetrad\nNicomachus's theorem\nSuperparticular number\nSuperpartient number\nPhilolaus\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Gillian Clark (1989).
