She is the daughter of actor Ranjit Mallick & Deepa Mallick. Her debut film was Nater Guru.\n Koel was born in Kolkata to Bengali film actor Ranjit Mallick and Deepa Mallick, of Kolkata's notable Mallick Bari of Bhowanipore (i.e., the Mallick family, which is closely associated with the powerful Barat and Gupta families), known for its Durga Puja.[2] Koel did her schooling from Modern High School for Girls, and completed a BSc (honors) in psychology from the Gokhale Memorial Girls' College, an affiliated college of the University of Calcutta.[3]\n Mallick's screen debut was in Nater Guru \u2013 opposite Jeet. Nater Guru was a \"runaway success\" at the box office.[4] The film, released in 2003, marked Mallick's entry into Tollywood. She also won her first award for Best Actor in Leading Role Female  from 4th Tele Cine Awards 2004 for Nater Guru.

While the first two performed poorly[clarification needed] at the box office, Bandhan  was a huge success in Bengal and was a blockbuster at the box office. It was also the highest grossing Bengali film of 2004.[citation needed]\n In 2005, Mallick appeared in Shubhodrishti, Manik, Yuddho and Chore Chore Mastuto Bhai. She appeared in Yuddho opposite actors Mithun Chakraborty and Debashree Roy. The film recorded an initial collection of \u20b9 12\u00a0million (12 million) in its first week.

She also starred in the Bengali remake of Love Story, the 2008 film Love.[6]\n Mallick made her television debut with her talk-show Katha O Kahini. The show went on to the channel Star Jalsha.[7] In 2013 Koel was on TV again as a celebrity judge in the Bengali version of Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa along with renowned Bollywood choreographer Remo D'Souza. The show aired on ETV Bangla.[8]\n She and Jeet was also seen as a guest in Star Jalsha serial Sansar Sukher Hoy Romonir Gune for the promotion of the movie 100% Love. Mallick has also appeared on the popular soap Bojhena Se Bojhena which is also aired on STAR Jalsha.
