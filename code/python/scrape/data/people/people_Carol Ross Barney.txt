She began her education in the Chicago Public Schools. In 1958, her father, an accountant and management consultant, was relocated to D\u00fcsseldorf in the British sector of West Germany. Returning to the Chicago area for high school, Carol was educated at the all-girls Catholic school, Regina Dominican, in Wilmette.[5]  She enrolled in the Architecture program at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign receiving a Bachelor of Architecture degree in 1971. She returned and completed her Master's of Architecture in 1984.[5]\n Barney enlisted in the U.S. Peace Corps immediately after graduation and was assigned to Costa Rica where she worked for the fledgling Costa Rican National Park Service. Her projects included a master plan for coral reef protection and interpretation at Parque Nacional Cahuita, restoration of the historic hacienda at Parque Nacional Santa Rosa and worker housing at Parque Nacional Volcan Poas.[5]\n Following Peace Corps service, Barney joined Holabird and Root in Chicago and met her mentor, John A.

Plym Traveling Fellowship from the University of Illinois. The fellowship funded travel for research and allowed her to study the post war planning and rebuilding of European cities during 1983\u201384.[8]\n In 2001, construction began for the new Oklahoma City Federal Building, with Barney chosen as the lead designer for the replacement building for the Oklahoma City Federal Building[9] following the terrorist bombing in 1995.[10] The new Oklahoma City Federal Building had the design objective to create a space that was secure but open to reflect the United States democracy.\n Barney has combined her own teaching with practice in 1976, when she taught at the University of Illinois Chicago.  Since 1994, she has been adjunct Professor of Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology where she teaches a popular advanced design studio and serves on the College of Architecture Board of Overseers.[11]\n Through her firm Ross Barney Architects, Carol has designed numerous projects for which she has received several accolades.
