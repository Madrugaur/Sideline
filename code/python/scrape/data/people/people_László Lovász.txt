{"name": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz", "content": "\n L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz (Hungarian:\u00a0[\u02c8la\u02d0slo\u02d0 \u02c8lova\u02d0s]; born March 9, 1948) is a Hungarian-American mathematician and professor emeritus at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, best known for his work in combinatorics, for which he was awarded the 2021 Abel Prize jointly with Avi Wigderson. He was the president of the International Mathematical Union from 2007 to 2010 and the president of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences from 2014 to 2020.\n In graph theory, Lov\u00e1sz's notable contributions include the proofs of Kneser's conjecture and the Lov\u00e1sz local lemma, as well as the formulation of the Erd\u0151s\u2013Faber\u2013Lov\u00e1sz conjecture. He is also one of the eponymous authors of the LLL lattice reduction algorithm.\n Lov\u00e1sz was born on March 9, 1948 in Budapest, Hungary.[2][3][1]\n Lov\u00e1sz attended the Fazekas Mih\u00e1ly Gimn\u00e1zium in Budapest.[4] From 1964 to 1966, he won three gold medals and one silver medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad.[2][3][5][4] He also participated in a Hungarian game show about math prodigies.[3] Paul Erd\u0151s helped introduce Lov\u00e1sz to graph theory at a young age.[3][6]\n Lov\u00e1sz received his Candidate of Sciences (C.Sc.) degree in 1970 at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.[3][7][1]  His advisor was Tibor Gallai.[7][8] He received his first doctorate (Dr.Rer.Nat.) degree from E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in 1971 and his second doctorate (Dr.Math.Sci.) from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1977.[1]\n From 1971 to 1975, Lov\u00e1sz worked at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University as a Research Associate.[1] From 1975 to 1978, he was a docent at the University of Szeged, and then served as a professor and the Chair of Geometry there until 1982.[1] He then returned to E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University as a professor and the Chair of Computer Science until 1993.[1]\n Lov\u00e1sz was a professor at Yale University from 1993 to 1999, when he moved to the Microsoft Research Center where he worked as a Senior Researcher until 2006.[1] He returned to E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University where he was the director of the Mathematical Institute (2006\u20132011)[9] and a professor in the Department of Computer Science (2006\u20132018).[1] He retired in 2018.[1]\n Lov\u00e1sz was the president of the International Mathematical Union between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2010.[10][6] In 2014, he was elected the President of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA) and served until 2020.[11][12][6]\n In collaboration with Erd\u0151s in the 1970s, Lov\u00e1sz developed complementary methods to Erd\u0151s's exisiting probabilistic graph theory techniques.[3] This included the Lov\u00e1sz local lemma, which has become a standard technique for proving the existence of rare graphs.[3] Also in graph theory, Lov\u00e1sz proved Kneser's conjecture and helped formulate the Erd\u0151s\u2013Faber\u2013Lov\u00e1sz conjecture.[3]\n With Arjen Lenstra and Hendrik Lenstra in 1982, Lov\u00e1sz developed the LLL algorithm for approximating points in lattices and reducing their bases.[3][13] The LLL algorithm has been described by Gil Kalai as \"one of the fundamental algorithms\" and has been used in several practical applications, including polynomial factorization algorithms and cryptography.[3]\n Lov\u00e1sz was awarded the P\u00f3lya Prize in 1979, the Fulkerson Prize in 1982, the Brouwer Medal in 1993, the Wolf Prize and Knuth Prize in 1999, the G\u00f6del Prize in 2001, the John von Neumann Theory Prize in 2006, the Bolyai Prize in 2007, the Sz\u00e9chenyi Prize in 2008, and the Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences in 2010.[1][14][15] In March 2021, he shared the Abel Prize with Avi Wigderson from the Institute for Advanced Study \"for their foundational contributions to theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics, and their leading role in shaping them into central fields of modern mathematics\".[2][3][6]\n He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006[16] and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 2007,  and an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society in 2009.[17] Lov\u00e1sz was elected as a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2012.[18] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[19] Lov\u00e1sz is listed as an ISI highly cited researcher.[20][dead link]\n Lov\u00e1sz is married to fellow mathematician Katalin Vesztergombi,[21] with whom he participated in a program for high school students gifted in mathematics,[22] and has four children.[1] He is a dual citizen of
