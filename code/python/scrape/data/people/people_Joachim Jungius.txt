In 1616, he returned to Rostock in order to study medicine, later obtaining his medical doctorate from the University of Padua with Santorio Santorio  in 1619. From 1619 to 1623, he practiced medicine in L\u00fcbeck. In 1622 at Rostock, he founded an early scientific society known as Societas Ereunetica sive Zetetica.\n From 1624 to 1628, Jungius worked as a professor of mathematics at Rostock, his service here being briefly interrupted in 1625, when he spent time as professor of medicine at the University of Helmstedt.
