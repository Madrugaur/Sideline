{"name": "Yvonne Dold-Samplonius", "content": "Yvonne Dold-Samplonius (20 May 1937 \u2013 16 June 2014) was a Dutch mathematician and historian who specialized in the history of Islamic mathematics during the Middle age. She was particularly interested in the mathematical methods used by Islamic architects and builders of the Middle Ages for measurements of volumes and measurements of religious buildings or in the design of muqarnas.\n Born on 20 May 1937 in Haarlem, Yvonne Samplonius obtained her degree in mathematics and Arabic from the University of Amsterdam (Doktoratsexamen) in 1966.[1] Yvonne Dold-Samplonius married in 1965 the German mathematician Albrecht Dold. She studied from 1966 to 1967 at Harvard University under the direction of Professor John E.

In 2000, she organized with Joseph Dauben the conference \"2000 Years of Transmission of Mathematical Ideas\".[13] In 2002, she became a Corresponding Member of the International Academy of the History of Sciences and was elected effective member in 2007.
