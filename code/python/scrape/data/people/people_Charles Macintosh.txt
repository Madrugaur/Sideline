{"name": "Charles Macintosh", "content": "\n Charles Macintosh FRS (29 December 1766 \u2013 25 July 1843) was a Scottish chemist and the inventor of waterproof fabric.[1] The Mackintosh raincoat (the variant spelling is now standard) is named after him.\n Macintosh was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of George Macintosh and Mary Moore, and was first employed as a clerk. Charles devoted his spare time to science, particularly chemistry, and before he was 20 resigned his clerkship to take up the manufacture of chemicals. In this he was highly successful and invented various new processes. His experiments with naphtha led to his invention of waterproof fabric; the essence of his patent was the cementing of two thicknesses of cloth together with natural rubber. The rubber is made soluble by the action of the naphtha. The naphtha was prepared by distillation of coal tar, with the Bonnington Chemical Works being a major supplier.[2]\n Macintosh married Mary Fisher in 1790, daughter of Alexander Fisher, a Glasgow merchant. They had one son, George Macintosh (1791\u20131848). In 1823, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society for his chemical discoveries. In 1828, he became a partner with James Beaumont Neilson in a firm to exploit the latter's patent for the hot blast blowing of blast furnaces, which saved considerably on their fuel consumption.[3]\n Charles died in 1843 and was buried in the Glasgow Cathedral graveyard.[4] He is buried with his parents in the ground of his great grandfather, John Anderson of Douhill, Lord Provost of Glasgow. His name is added to the 17th century monument which stands against the eastern boundary wall. A late 19th century secondary memorial also exists, in polished red granite, slightly to the north, where Charles is again mentioned on the grave of his son, George.\n On 29 December 2016, the search engine Google marked the 250th anniversary of the birth of the inventor of the waterproof raincoat with a Google doodle of Macintosh in the rain.[5][6]\n ", "tags": ["1766 births", "1843 deaths", "Fellows of the Royal Society", "People from Glasgow", "Scottish chemists", "Scottish inventors", "Burials at Glasgow Cathedral", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the ODNB", "Pages using cite ODNB with id parameter", "Articles incorporating Cite DNB template", "Use dmy dates from December 2016", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference", "Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "For those of a similar name, see Charles Mackintosh (disambiguation).\n\n\nCharles MacintoshCharles MacintoshBorn29 December 1766Glasgow, ScotlandDied25 July 1843(1843-07-25) (aged\u00a076)Glasgow, ScotlandNationalityBritishOccupationEngineerEngineering careerSignificant advanceWaterproof fabric Invented the waterproof raincoat in 1824\n\nThe grave of Charles Macintosh, Glasgow Cathedral (left).
