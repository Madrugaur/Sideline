He graduated from the St Petersburg Academy of Arts in 1904. His works portrayed sensitive and artistic neoclassical trends popular in those years. Some of his early works included the mansion of V. P. Kochubei in Tsarskoye Selo, 1911\u20131912; the house of Prince S. A. Scherbatov in Novinski Boulevard in Moscow, 1911\u20131913; the village railway employees housing and the tuberculosis sanatorium at the Prozorovskaya station (now Kratovo) near Moscow, 1913\u20131923; central workshops of Kazan railway in Lyubertsy, 1916).\n He became an Academician of Architecture in 1914, in 1917 he was elected as the Vice-President of the Academy of Arts. In 1923 he moved to Yerevan, heading the new construction effort in the republic. He was the chief engineer of the local Council of People's Commissars and was a member of the CEC of the Armenian SSR (1925\u20131936), sponsored the construction industry, designed the layouts of towns and villages including Leninakan (now Gyumri) (1925), Stepanakert (1926), Nor-Bayazet (now Gavar) and Ahta-ahpara (both in 1927), Echmiadzin (1927\u20131928), and others. Tamanian created the first general plan of the modern city of Yerevan which was approved in 1924. Tamanian's style was instrumental in transforming what was essentially a small provincial city into the modern Armenian capital, a major industrial and cultural center. Neoclassicism dominated his designs but Tamanian also implemented a national flavor (red linings of tuff, traditional decorative carvings on stone etc.). Among his most famous designs in Yerevan are the hydroelectric station (ERGES-1, 1926), the Opera and Ballet house named after A. Spendiarian (1926\u20131953), the Republic Square (1926\u20131941) and others. He also played a major role in the development of restoration projects of historical landmarks in the country, chairing the Committee for the Protection of Historic Monuments in Armenia.\n Tamanian was married to Camilla Edwards, a member of the Benois family. Their sons Gevorg (Georgi) and Yulius Tamanian also became noted architects and continued their father's work.\n Tamanian died in Yerevan on February 20, 1936 and is buried at the Komitas Pantheon which is located in the city center of Yerevan.[1]\n Tamanian also designed the layout of many towns and cities in Armenia, such as:\n ", "tags": ["Ethnic Armenian architects", "Russian people of Armenian descent", "Architects of the Russian Empire", "Soviet architects", "People from Krasnodar", "1878 births", "1936 deaths", "Burials at the Komitas Pantheon", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Armenian-language text", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers"], "raw": "Alexander Tamanian \u0531\u056c\u0565\u0584\u057d\u0561\u0576\u0564\u0580 \u0539\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0576\u0575\u0561\u0576500 Armenian dram banknote honoring TamanianBornMarch 4, 1878Yekaterinodar, Kuban Oblast, Russian EmpireDiedFebruary 20, 1936Yerevan, Armenian SSR, Soviet UnionNationalityArmenianOccupationArchitectBuildingsArmenian Opera TheaterProjectsMain Layout of Yerevan\n\nAlexander Tamanian (Armenian: \u0531\u056c\u0565\u0584\u057d\u0561\u0576\u0564\u0580 \u0539\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0576\u0575\u0561\u0576, March 4, 1878 \u2013 February 20, 1936) was a Russian-born Armenian neoclassical architect, well known for his work in the city of Yerevan.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and work\n2 Buildings\n3 Projects\n4 Notes\n5 References\n\n\nLife and work[edit]\nTamanian was born in the city of Yekaterinodar in 1878 in the family of a banker.
