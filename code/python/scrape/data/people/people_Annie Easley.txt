{"name": "Annie Easley", "content": "Annie J. Easley (April 23, 1933 \u2013 June 25, 2011) was an American computer scientist, mathematician, and rocket scientist.[1] She worked for the Lewis Research Center (now Glenn Research Center[2]) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and its predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). She was a leading member of the team which developed software for the Centaur rocket stage,[3] and was one of the first African-Americans to work at NASA. Easley was posthumously inducted into the Glenn Research Hall of Fame in 2015. \n A crater on the moon was named after her in 2021.[4]\n Annie Easley was born to Bud McCrory and Willie Sims  in Birmingham, Alabama.[1] She was raised by her mother and had a brother six years her senior.[5] Before the Civil Rights Movement, educational and career opportunities for African-American children were very limited. Segregation was prevalent, African-American children were educated separately from white children, and their schools were often inferior to white schools. Annie's mother told her that she could be anything, but she would have to work at it. She encouraged Annie to get a good education. From the fifth grade through high school, Annie attended Holy Family High School, and was valedictorian of her graduating class.[6] At a young age Annie had interest in becoming a nurse, but around the age of 16 she decided to study pharmacy.[5]\n In 1950, Easley enrolled in classes at Xavier University in New Orleans,[3] which was then an African-American Roman Catholic University, and majored in pharmacy for about two years.[6]\n In 1954, she returned to Birmingham. As part of the Jim Crow laws that maintained racial inequality, African Americans were required to pass a literacy test and pay a poll tax in order to vote, which was outlawed in 1964 in the Twenty-fourth Amendment. She remembered the test giver looking at her application and saying only, \"You went to Xavier University. Two dollars.\"  Subsequently, she helped other African-Americans prepare for the test.[7]\n Shortly thereafter, she moved to Cleveland to be closer to her husband's family,[8] with the intention of continuing her studies. Unfortunately, the local university had ended its pharmacy program a short time before and no nearby alternative existed.[9]\n Throughout the 1970s, Easley advocated for and encouraged female and minority students at college career days to work in STEM careers.[10] She tutored elementary and high school children as well as young adults who had dropped out of school in a work-study program.[9]\n In 1954, Annie Easley married a man from the military. After her husband had been discharged from the military, the 2 of them moved to Cleveland, Ohio to be near his family.[11] Easley divorced later in her life. She continued attending school and furthered her education. It was common for her to be tutoring or studying in her free time. She obtained another degree from Cleveland State in the department of mathematics.[9]\n Easley had always loved dressing up. She wore stockings and heels almost everyday in college. Although there were no dress code in her work department, wearing pants as a woman during that time was still not normalized. However, she was one of the first to wear pants to work in the 1970s after talking to her supervisor about it. [5]\n In her first three years after retiring from NASA, Easley focused on volunteer work, often telling people she put more miles on her car as a retiree than as a worker. She traveled the world, mostly to ski, and become an independent contractor in real estate. Although she no longer tutored, she expressed that she was always willing to talk to students at career days and similar events if asked.[5]\n In 1955, Easley read a story in a local newspaper about twin sisters who worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) as \"computers\".[12] She applied for a job the next day, and was hired two weeks later - one of four African Americans of about 2500 employees. She began her career as computer at the NACA Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (which became NASA Lewis Research Center, 1958\u20131999, and subsequently the John H. Glenn Research Center) in Cleveland, Ohio.[13] Later after electronic computers started being used at NASA her title changed to mathematician and computer technician. She continued her education while working for the agency, and in 1977, obtained a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Cleveland State University.[14] After receiving her degree Easley also had to complete specialization courses at NASA in order to be considered a professional at NASA. Easley was denied financial aid that other employees received for education, without explanation from the agency.[8] She also noted that she did not feel that her pay was very high when she first started with two years of college. Although she was promised a GS-3 in her interview, her first paycheck was a GS-2, and when she questioned it she was told there were no more GS-3s available.[5]\n Easley's outreach for minorities did not end with her volunteer work at college career days. At NASA she took upon herself to be an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor. This was one of the formal ways that she helped her supervisors at NASA address discrimination complaints from all levels.[15] She was also part of a recruitment effort on behalf of NASA for engineering students from numerous colleges.[5]\n Her 34-year career included developing and implementing computer code that analyzed alternative power technologies, supported the Centaur high-energy upper rocket stage, determined solar, wind and energy projects, and identified energy conversion systems and alternative systems to solve energy problems.[16] During the 1970s Easley worked on a project examining damage to the ozone layer. With massive cuts in the NASA space program, Easley began working on energy problems. Her energy assignments included studies to determine the life use of storage batteries, such as those used in electric utility vehicles. Her computer applications have been used to identify energy conversion systems that offer the improvement over commercially available technologies. Following the energy crisis of the late 1970s Easley studied the economic advantages of co-generating power plants that obtained byproducts from coal and steam.[17] After retiring in 1989, she remained an active participant in the Speaker\u2019s Bureau and the Business & Professional Women\u2019s association.[13] Despite her long career and numerous contributions to research, she was cut out of NASA's promotional photos. In response to one such event, Easley responded by saying \"I'm out here to do a job and I knew I had the ability to do it, and that's where my focus was, on getting the job done. I was not intentionally trying to be a pioneer.\" which showed that she placed her work and solving problems before everything else.[8]\n Easley's work with the Centaur project helped lay the technological foundations for future space shuttle launches and launches of communication, military and weather satellites.[3][13] Her work contributed to the 1997 flight to Saturn of the Cassini probe, the launcher of which had the Centaur as its upper stage.[13]\n Annie Easley was interviewed in Cleveland on August 21, 2001 by Sandra Johnson.[5] The interview is stored in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Johnson Space Center Oral History Program. The 55 page interview transcript includes material on the history of the Civil Rights Movement, Glenn Research Center, Johnson Space Center, space flight, and the contribution of women to space flight. In that same Interview, Easley was asked whether she still played with gadgets and stated \"I don't have the time or the desire. I will get the email and I'll send it, but I don't play with it. It's not like this fascinating thing I play with. I'd much rather be out doing something actively, like on the golf course or doing other things.\"[9]\n Easley lived in a time where women and African-Americans were facing discrimination from society, although she prided herself in her work ethic and achieved her goals nonetheless.  She also experienced some discrimination related to being an African-American during her career, especially with the picture-cutting incident\u00a0 at her work, when her face was cut out from a picture to put it on display. In her 34-year career she worked in four different departments: the Computer Services Division, the Energy Directorate, the Launch Vehicles Group and the Engineering Directorate, although none of her moves were due to promotions, which she recognized may have been due to her race or sex.[5]\n Easley was also a budding athlete who founded and subsequently became the first President of the NASA Lewis Ski Club and participated in other local ski clubs in the Cleveland area.[1][5]\n Annie Easley\n ", "tags": ["1933 births", "2011 deaths", "African-American women engineers", "African-American mathematicians", "20th-century American mathematicians", "21st-century American mathematicians", "American women mathematicians", "Cleveland State University alumni", "People from Birmingham, Alabama", "Xavier University of Louisiana alumni", "American women computer scientists", "American computer scientists", "Women rocket scientists", "Mathematicians from Alabama", "Engineers from Alabama", "Computer programmers", "Software engineers", "20th-century women engineers", "21st-century women engineers", "20th-century women mathematicians", "21st-century women mathematicians", "African-American academics", "African-American computer scientists", "CS1 errors: missing title", "CS1 errors: requires URL", "CS1 errors: access-date without URL", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "American mathematician and rocket scientist\nAnnie EasleyBorn(1933-04-23)April 23, 1933Birmingham, AlabamaDiedJune 25, 2011(2011-06-25) (aged\u00a078)Cleveland, OhioNationalityAmericanEducationB.S. in Mathematics, 1977Alma\u00a0materCleveland State UniversityOccupationComputer engineerEmployerLewis Research Center at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); National Advisory Committee for AeronauticsKnown\u00a0forNACA and NASA work\nAnnie J.
