Twelve sondes were prepared for that purpose at Pavlovsk Observatory under Molchanov's leadership and successfully launched, conducting the first aerological observations in the Arctic.[5] Molchanov also participated in first Soviet stratospheric balloon ascents (1933\u201334).\n Since 1935 serial production of radiosondes was started in Leningrad. Molchanov's radiosonde construction was so perfect technically, that it was used until 1958 without any significant changes, providing sufficient accuracy of measurements, regularity and stability.[5]\n In April 1941, Molchanov was arrested by Stalin's secret police.
