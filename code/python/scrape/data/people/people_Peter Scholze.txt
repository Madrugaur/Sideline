{"name": "Peter Scholze", "content": "\n Peter Scholze (born 11 December 1987)[2] is a German mathematician known for his work in arithmetic geometry. He has been a professor at the University of Bonn since 2012 and director at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics since 2018. He has been called one of the leading mathematicians in the world.[3][4][5][6] He won the Fields Medal in 2018, which is regarded as the highest professional honor in mathematics.[7][8][9]\n Scholze was born in Dresden and grew up in Berlin.[10] His father is a physicist, his mother a computer scientist, and his sister studied chemistry.[11] He attended the Heinrich-Hertz-Gymnasium\u00a0[de] in Berlin-Friedrichshain, a gymnasium devoted to  mathematics and science.[12] As a student, Scholze participated in the International Mathematical Olympiad, winning three gold medals and one silver medal.[13]\n He studied at the University of Bonn and completed his Bachelor's degree in three semesters and his Master's degree in two further semesters.[14] He obtained his Ph.D. in 2012 under the supervision of Michael Rapoport.[1]\n From July 2011 until 2016, Scholze was a Research Fellow of the Clay Mathematics Institute in New Hampshire.[15] In 2012, shortly after completing his PhD, he was made full professor at the University of Bonn, becoming at the age of 24 the youngest full professor in Germany.[3][14][16][17] \nIn Fall 2014, Scholze was appointed the Chancellor's Professor at University of California, Berkeley, where he taught a course on p-adic geometry.[18][19] \nIn 2018, Scholze was appointed as a director of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn.[20]\n Scholze's work has concentrated on purely local aspects of arithmetic geometry such as p-adic geometry and its applications. He presented in a more compact form some of the previous fundamental theories pioneered by Gerd Faltings, Jean-Marc Fontaine and later by Kiran Kedlaya. His PhD thesis on perfectoid spaces[21] yields the solution to a special case of the weight-monodromy conjecture.[22]\n Scholze and Bhargav Bhatt have developed a theory of prismatic cohomology, which has been described as progress towards motivic cohomology by unifying singular cohomology, de Rham cohomology, \u2113-adic cohomology, and crystalline cohomology.[23][24]\n In 2012, he was awarded the Prix and Cours Peccot.[25] He was awarded the 2013 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize.[26] In 2014, he received the Clay Research Award.[27] In 2015, he was awarded the Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Algebra,[28] and the Ostrowski Prize.[29][30]\n He received the Fermat Prize 2015 from the Institut de Math\u00e9matiques de Toulouse.[31] In 2016, he was awarded the Leibniz Prize 2016 by the German Research Foundation.[32] He declined the $100,000 \"New Horizons in Mathematics Prize\" of the 2016 Breakthrough Prizes.[33] His turning down of the prize received little media attention.[34]\n He was awarded the Fields Medal in 2018,[35][36] for \"transforming arithmetic algebraic geometry over p-adic fields through his introduction of perfectoid spaces, with application to Galois representations, and for the development of new cohomology theories\".[37]\n In 2019, Scholze received the Great Cross of Merit of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.[38][39][40]\n Scholze is married to a fellow mathematician[41] and has a daughter.[42]\n ", "tags": ["1987 births", "Living people", "Fields Medalists", "21st-century German mathematicians", "Scientists from Berlin", "International Mathematical Olympiad participants", "Commanders Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "University of Bonn faculty", "University of Bonn alumni", "Arithmetic geometers", "People from Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg", "CS1 German-language sources (de)", "CS1 French-language sources (fr)", "Use dmy dates from August 2018", "Articles with hCards", "Articles with German-language sources (de)", "Pages containing links to subscription-only content", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nNot to be confused with Peter Scholz.\nPeter ScholzePeter Scholze in 2014Born (1987-12-11) 11 December 1987 (age\u00a033)Dresden, East GermanyNationalityGermanAlma\u00a0materUniversity of Bonn Known\u00a0forIntroduction of perfectoid spacesChildren1AwardsPrix and Cours Peccot (2012)SASTRA Ramanujan Prize (2013) Clay Research Award (2014) Cole Prize (2015)  Fermat Prize (2015)  Ostrowski Prize (2015) EMS Prize (2016)  Leibniz Prize (2016) Berlin-Brandenburg Academy Award (2016)Fields Medal (2018)Scientific careerFieldsMathematicsArithmetic geometryAlgebraic geometryNumber theoryInstitutionsUniversity of BonnMax Planck Institute for MathematicsAcademy of Sciences LeopoldinaUniversity of California, BerkeleyClay Mathematics InstituteThesisPerfectoid Spaces\u00a0(2011)Doctoral advisorMichael Rapoport[1]\n\nPeter Scholze (born 11 December 1987)[2] is a German mathematician known for his work in arithmetic geometry.
