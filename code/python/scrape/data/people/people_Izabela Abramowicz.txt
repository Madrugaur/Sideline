{"name": "Izabela Abramowicz", "content": "\n Izabela Abramowicz (9 November 1889, Lutos\u0142awice \u2013 22 January 1973, \u0141\u0119czyca) was a Polish mathematician and mathematics educator. She was honoured with the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for her services to mathematical education.\n Izabela Abramowicz was born in 1889 in Lutos\u0142awice, Poland (then a satellite of the Russian empire),[1] to Tomasz Franciszek Abramowicz, a school teacher, and Maria Petronela (n\u00e9e Gniotek). She had two brothers, Kazimierz (who would also become a mathematician) and Zygmunt.[2]\n Abramowicz graduated from the State Gymnasium in Bobrujsk in 1907.[1] She attended the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at the Saint Vladimir University in Kiev, obtaining an undergraduate degree with a gold medal for her thesis On double integrals on algebraic surfaces. Her dissertation supervisor was Boris Yakovlevich Bukreev.[3]\n She received consent from the Minister of Education to remain at the university without a stipend to prepare for her master's degree, the requirements for which she had almost fulfilled in 1918.[1]\n In 1923, she moved to \u0141\u0119czyca, near Pozna\u0144, where she stayed till the Second World War. During the German occupation of Poland, between 1942 and 1944, she was arrested and made to work at various factories in Pozna\u0144 and Lubo\u0144. After the war, she returned to Pozna\u0144.[4][5]\n Abramowicz died on 22 January 1973, and was interred at the parish church in Wiry.[6]\n Between 1917\u20131920, Abramowicz was a docent at the Polish University College in Kiev. This had been set up in 1916 to teach humanities, but expanded later to allow mathematics and the sciences. Its faculty comprised Polish academics teaching at Russian universities. Abramowicz was one of two women in the faculty.[7]\n She also taught in three local gymnasiums.[5]\n In 1923, Abramowicz started work as a math teacher at the State Junior High School in Wolsztyn. In the years 1924\u20131939 she was a teacher of mathematics at the General Zamoyski State Gymnasium in Pozna\u0144.[5][8]\n Abramowicz was a member of the Polish Scientific Society in Kiev.[7] She attended three mathematical conferences: the 1st Polish Mathematical Congress in Lviv (1927), the 1st Congress of Mathematicians of Slavic Countries in Warsaw (1929) and the 2nd Polish Mathematical Congress in Vilnius (1931).[5]\n Following the end of the war, she taught mathematics at the Zamoyski State Gymnasium till 1953, after which she worked at the Adam Mickiewicz High School, retiring in 1968.[9]\n For her services to education, Abramowicz was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta.[10]\n ", "tags": ["20th-century Polish mathematicians", "1889 births", "1973 deaths", "Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv alumni", "Polish women mathematicians", "Mathematics educators", "Knights of the Order of Polonia Restituta", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Use dmy dates from February 2021", "Articles with hCards", "CS1 Polish-language sources (pl)", "AC with 0 elements"], "raw": "Polish mathematician\n\n\nIzabela AbramowiczBorn(1889-11-09)9 November 1889Lutos\u0142awiceDied22 January 1973(1973-01-22) (aged\u00a083)\u0141\u0119czycaResting placeWiry, Greater Poland VoivodeshipNationalityPolishAlma\u00a0materSaint Vladimir University AwardsKnight's CrossScientific careerFieldsMathematicsThesisOn double integrals on algebraic surfacesAcademic advisorsBoris Yakovlevich Bukreev\n\nIzabela Abramowicz (9 November 1889, Lutos\u0142awice \u2013 22 January 1973, \u0141\u0119czyca) was a Polish mathematician and mathematics educator.
