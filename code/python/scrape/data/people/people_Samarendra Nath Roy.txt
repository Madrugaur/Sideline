{"name": "Samarendra Nath Roy", "content": "\n Samarendra Nath Roy or S. N. Roy (11 December 1906\u00a0\u2013 23 July 1964) was an Indian-born American mathematician and an applied statistician.\n Roy was the first of three children of Kali Nath Roy and Suniti Bala Roy.[1] His father, was a freedom fighter and the Chief Editor of the newspaper The Tribune, then publishing from Lahore.[2] During the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in April 1919, The Tribune published a news report titled \"Prayer at the Jama Masjid\", on 6 April 1919. For this \"offence\" Kali Nath Roy was sentenced to imprisonment of two years along with a fine of one thousand rupees.[3][4][5][6]\n Roy secured first division in the Matriculation Examination in 1923 from the Khulna District School.[6] He was the topper in the Intermediate Science (Higher Secondary) Examinations in 1925 from the Daulatpur Hindu Academy.[6] He obtained first class and was the topper in both the BSc Mathematics (Honours) from Presidency College of the University of Calcutta in 1928 and the MSc in Mixed Mathematics - which later was renamed to Applied Mathematics - (with The Theory of Relativity as the elective) from the renowned Rajabazar Science College, University of Calcutta in 1931.[1][6]\n In 1931, when Roy joined the Department of Applied Mathematics of Rajabazar Science College at the University of Calcutta as a research associate, he used computing facilities at the newly established Indian Statistical Institute,[6] which was founded by Professor P. C. Mahalanobis. Roy along with several talented young scholars including J. M. Sengupta, H. C. Sinha, Raj Chandra Bose, K. R. Nair, K. Kishen and C. R. Rao, joined to form an active group of statisticians under Mahalanobis. Roy was one of the very early students of Mahalanobis, who initiated some of the early works in Statistics.[7] He was well known for his pioneering contribution to multivariate statistical analysis, mainly that of the Jacobians of complicated transformations for various exact distributions, rectangular coordinates and the Bartlett decomposition.[8] His dissertation included the Post master's work at the Indian Statistical Institute where he worked under Mahalanobis.[9]\n It was Bose who first went to the United States as a visiting professor at Columbia University and then joined the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1947. Roy followed suit by later joining him at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the spring of 1950, after initially travelling to the United States to take up a Visiting Professorship of Statistics at Columbia University in New York in the spring of 1949. In between this Roy returned to India and became Head of the Department of Statistics at the University of Calcutta during the academic year 1949\u201350.[6] Roy joined Bose as full Professor of Statistics in the Statistics Department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. S. N. Roy had 15 doctorate students there from 1950 till 1963.[10] To commemorate his Birth Centenary an International Conference on \"Multivariate Statistical Methods in the 21st Century: The Legacy of Prof. S.N. Roy\" was held at Kolkata, India during 28\u201329 December 2006.[11] The Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference published a special issue for celebrating the Centennial of Birth of S. N. Roy.[7]\n Roy was married to Bani Roy and had four children, Prabir, Subir, Tapon and Sunanda. He died while on holiday in Jasper, Canada.\n Sources:[7][9][13]\n ", "tags": ["1906 births", "1964 deaths", "Indian statisticians", "Bengali mathematicians", "Bengali people", "20th-century Indian mathematicians", "University of Calcutta faculty", "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faculty", "Scientists from Kolkata", "University of Calcutta alumni", "Indian Statistical Institute faculty", "Binghamton University faculty", "EngvarB from September 2014", "Use dmy dates from September 2014", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers"], "raw": "\n\nS.N.
