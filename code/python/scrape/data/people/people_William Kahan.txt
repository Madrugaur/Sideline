{"name": "William Kahan", "content": "William \"Velvel\" Morton Kahan (born June 5, 1933) is a Canadian mathematician and computer scientist, who received the Turing Award in 1989 for \"his fundamental contributions to numerical analysis\",[2]\nwas named an ACM Fellow in 1994,[2] and inducted into the National Academy of Engineering in 2005.[2]\n Born to a Canadian Jewish family,[2] he attended the University of Toronto, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1954, his master's degree in 1956, and his Ph.D. in 1958, all in the field of mathematics. Kahan is now emeritus professor of mathematics and of electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS) at the University of California, Berkeley.\n Kahan was the primary architect behind the IEEE 754-1985 standard for floating-point computation (and its radix-independent follow-on, IEEE 854).
