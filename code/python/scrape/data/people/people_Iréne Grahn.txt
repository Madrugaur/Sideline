{"name": "Ir\u00e9ne Grahn", "content": "Ir\u00e9ne Maria Grahn, born 7 February 1945 in V\u00e4sterbotten, died 19 September 2013 in T\u00e4llberg, was a Swedish visual artist and medical device inventor. \n Ir\u00e9ne Grahn was born in V\u00e4sterbotten and grew up in a group of six siblings. She trained as a visual artist having studied at Capellag\u00e5rden in Vickleby on \u00d6land, the second largest Swedish island, and at the Textile Institute in Bor\u00e5s, Sweden.[1][2][3]\n As a professional artist, Grahn was inspired by nature and worked on many public space assignments for local and national government agencies using various materials ranging from tapestries to watercolors. When she became pregnant, however, she fell ill with rheumatoid arthritis, which can cause the patient's joints to become inflamed, growing swollen, sore and stiff. She was bedridden throughout her pregnancy. However, her arthritic condition did not improve even after she gave birth.[1][3]\n Although medication eased her discomfort, her finger joints began developing incorrectly, causing her fingers to grow in a crooked fashion.[3] At first she tried plastic splints but found only limited success, and they were very unattractive as well. Inspired, she invented a finger-joint support that she called Fingerf\u00e4rdig (Finger ready) that was both beautiful and functional. The device is worn like a pair of connected rings around an inflamed finger joint, forcing it to grow straight. She had prototypes made by a silversmith she knew personally from her art education and wore them on her fingers for many years.[1][4]\n Eventually, with the encouragement of doctors and patients alike, Grahn decided to patent her invention in 1992 and start the company IMG Mobility to make, market, sell and distribute the devices in many countries, including some outside the Nordic region.[3][4] Her invention became registered as a medical device by a Swedish government agency.[1]\n Grahn died after a short illness on 19 September 2013 at 68. She was survived by her son Axel.[3]\n \n ", "tags": ["1945 births", "2013 deaths", "Swedish inventors", "20th-century Swedish artists", "20th-century Swedish women", "20th-century Swedish women artists", "Women inventors", "CS1 Swedish-language sources (sv)", "Articles with hCards", "Wikipedia articles with KULTURNAV identifiers"], "raw": "Ir\u00e9ne GrahnBornIr\u00e9ne Maria Grahn7 February 1945V\u00e4sterbotten, SwedenDied19 September 2013T\u00e4llberg, SwedenNationalitySwedishAlma\u00a0materCapellag\u00e5rden, Textile InstituteOccupationInventor, artistKnown\u00a0forInventing a finger-joint support device\nIr\u00e9ne Maria Grahn, born 7 February 1945 in V\u00e4sterbotten, died 19 September 2013 in T\u00e4llberg, was a Swedish visual artist and medical device inventor. \n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n2 Honors and awards\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\nBiography[edit]\nIr\u00e9ne Grahn was born in V\u00e4sterbotten and grew up in a group of six siblings.
