{"name": "Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n", "content": "Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n (Hungarian: (sz\u0151l\u0151skislaki) K\u00e1rm\u00e1n T\u00f3dor [(s\u00f8\u02d0l\u00f8\u02d0\u0283ki\u0283l\u0252ki) \u02c8ka\u02d0rma\u02d0n \u02c8to\u02d0dor]; 11 May 1881\u00a0\u2013 6 May 1963) was a Hungarian-American mathematician, aerospace engineer, and physicist who was active primarily in the fields of aeronautics and astronautics. He was responsible for many key advances in aerodynamics, notably on supersonic and hypersonic airflow characterization. He is regarded as the outstanding aerodynamic theoretician of the 20th century.[3][4][5][6]\n K\u00e1rm\u00e1n was born into a Jewish family in Budapest, Austria-Hungary as K\u00e1rm\u00e1n T\u00f3dor, the son of Helen (Kohn or Konn, Hungarian: Kohn Ilka[7]) and M\u00f3r K\u00e1rm\u00e1n.[8] One of his ancestors was Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel.[1] He studied engineering at the city's Royal Joseph Technical University, known today as Budapest University of Technology and Economics. After graduating in 1902 he moved to the German Empire and joined Ludwig Prandtl at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he received his doctorate in 1908. He taught at G\u00f6ttingen for four years. In 1912 he accepted a position as director of the Aeronautical Institute at RWTH Aachen University, a leading German university. His time at RWTH Aachen was interrupted by service in the Austro-Hungarian Army from 1915 to 1918, when he designed the Petr\u00f3czy-K\u00e1rm\u00e1n-\u017durovec, an early helicopter.\n After the war he returned to Aachen with his mother and sister Josephine de Karman. Some of his students took an interest in gliding and saw the competitions of the Rh\u00f6n-Rossitten Gesellschaft as an opportunity to advance in aeronautics. K\u00e1rm\u00e1n engaged Wolfgang Klemperer to design a competitive glider.[9]\n Josephine encouraged her brother Theodore to expand his science beyond national boundaries. They organized the first international conference in mechanics held in September 1922 in Innsbruck. Subsequent conferences were organized as the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.[10] K\u00e1rm\u00e1n left his post at RWTH Aachen in 1930.\n Apprehensive about developments in Europe, in 1930 K\u00e1rm\u00e1n accepted the directorship of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT). The directorship included provision for a research assistant, and he selected Frank Wattendorf, an American who had been studying for three years in Aachen.\n Another student Ernest Edwin Sechler took up the problem of making reliable airframes for aircraft, and with K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's support, developed an understanding of aeroelasticity.\n In 1936, K\u00e1rm\u00e1n engaged the legal services of Andrew G. Haley to form the Aerojet Corporation, with his graduate student Frank Malina and their experimental rocketry collaborator Jack Parsons, to manufacture JATO rocket motors. He later became a naturalized citizen of the United States.\n German activity during World War II increased US military interest in rocket research. In early 1943, the Experimental Engineering Division of the United States Army Air Forces Material Command forwarded to K\u00e1rm\u00e1n reports from British intelligence sources describing German rockets capable of travelling more than 100 miles (160\u00a0km). In a letter dated 2 August 1943 K\u00e1rm\u00e1n provided the Army with his analysis of and comments on the German program.[11]\n In 1944 he and others affiliated with GALCIT founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which is now a Federally funded research and development center managed and operated by Caltech under a contract from NASA. In 1946 he became the first chairman of the Scientific Advisory Group which studied aeronautical technologies for the United States Army Air Forces. He also helped found AGARD, the NATO aerodynamics research oversight group (1951), the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences (1956), the International Academy of Astronautics (1960), and the Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics in Sint-Genesius-Rode, south of Brussels (1956).\n He eventually became an important figure in supersonic motion, noting in a seminal paper that aeronautical engineers were \"pounding hard on the closed door leading into the field of supersonic motion.\"[12]\n In June 1944, K\u00e1rm\u00e1n underwent surgery for intestinal cancer in New York City. The surgery caused two hernias, and K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's recovery was slow. Early in September, while still in New York, he met US Army Air Forces Commanding General Henry H. Arnold on a runway at LaGuardia Airport, and Arnold then proposed that K\u00e1rm\u00e1n should move to Washington, D.C. to lead the Scientific Advisory Group and become a long-range planning consultant to the military. K\u00e1rm\u00e1n returned to Pasadena around mid-September, was appointed to the SAG position on October 23, 1944, and left Caltech in December 1944.[13]\n At the age of 81 K\u00e1rm\u00e1n was the recipient of the first National Medal of Science, bestowed in a White House ceremony by President John F. Kennedy. He was recognized, \"For his leadership in the science and engineering basic to aeronautics; for his effective teaching and related contributions in many fields of mechanics, for his distinguished counsel to the Armed Services, and for his promoting international cooperation in science and engineering.\"[14]\n K\u00e1rm\u00e1n never married. He died on a trip to Aachen, Germany, in 1963, five days short of his 82nd birthday,[15] and his body was returned to the United States, to be entombed in the Beth Olam Mausoleum at what is now the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.[16] He has sometimes been described as one of The Martians.[17]\n K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's fame was in the use of mathematical tools to study fluid flow,[18] and the interpretation of those results to guide practical designs. He was instrumental in recognizing the importance of swept-back wings ubiquitous in modern jet aircraft.\n Specific contributions include theories of non-elastic buckling, unsteady wakes in circum-cylinder flow, stability of laminar flow, turbulence, airfoils in steady and unsteady flow, boundary layers, and supersonic aerodynamics. He made additional contributions in other fields, including elasticity, vibration, heat transfer, and crystallography. His name also appears in a number of concepts, for example:\n Four years after K\u00e1rm\u00e1n died his autobiography The Wind and Beyond was published by Lee Edson with Little, Brown and Company. Seven major academic journals then followed with book reviews by noted authors: As the book was non-technical, written for the general reader, Thomas P. Hughes[19] cited that as problematic given the technical context of K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's work. Hughes conceded that K\u00e1rm\u00e1n \"exhibited a genius for finding the simplifying assumptions that made possible the mathematical analysis.\" While acknowledging K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's gifts as an applied mathematician and teacher, Stanley Corrsin points out that the autobiography is \"marriage between a man and his ego.\" In the later part of his life, K\u00e1rm\u00e1n was a \"planner of global symposia and societies\" and a \"consultant to the upper echelons of the Pentagon corps.\"[20]\n On creativity, K\u00e1rm\u00e1n wrote \"the finest creative thought comes not out of organized teams but out of the quiet of one's own world.\"[9]:307 In his review[21] I. B. Holley noted \"penetrating insights into the creative process, its ingredients, nurture and exploitation.\" According to Holley, K\u00e1rm\u00e1n was given to \"convivial drinking and the company of beautiful women.\"\n An enthusiastic review by J. Kestin[22] advised readers to buy and study the book, and prize it as a reference. On the other hand, Charles S\u00fcsskind[23] faults K\u00e1rm\u00e1n for his contempt for the conventional (gaminarie). S\u00fcsskind expected the book to show some reaction to Wernher von Braun\u2019s coming to America, and some clarification of the Hsue-shen Tsien affair, rather than \"lapses into generalities\". S\u00fcsskind also tags K\u00e1rm\u00e1n as a militarist: a \"forthright engineer who is quite unabashed about his lifelong association with military authorities in whatever country he happened to reside at the time.\"\n Sydney Goldstein, who also wrote the Royal Society memoir for K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, reviewed the autobiography[24] and remembered \"an eminent engineer and scientist, warm-hearted and witty, much traveled, well-known by many, devoted to international collaboration, who, in his own words, as a scientist found the military 'the most comfortable group to deal with'\".\n \n ", "tags": ["1881 births", "1963 deaths", "20th-century American scientists", "Aerodynamicists", "ASME Medal recipients", "Austro-Hungarian military personnel of World War I", "Budapest University of Technology and Economics alumni", "California Institute of Technology faculty", "Early spaceflight scientists", "Fellows of the American Physical Society", "Fluid dynamicists", "Foreign Members of the Royal Society", "Hungarian aerospace engineers", "Hungarian emigrants to the United States", "Hungarian physicists", "Hungarian inventors", "Hungarian Jews", "Hungarian nobility", "American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent", "Jewish American scientists", "Jewish inventors", "Jewish physicists", "John Fritz Medal recipients", "Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring recipients", "Knights Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany", "Medal for Merit recipients", "National Medal of Science laureates", "Scientists from Budapest", "Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal winners", "RWTH Aachen University faculty", "20th-century inventors", "University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni", "University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Pages using infobox scientist with unknown parameters", "Articles containing Hungarian-language text", "Commons category link from Wikidata", "Articles with Internet Archive links", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with MGP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VcBA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "Use American English from January 2014", "All Wikipedia articles written in American English"], "raw": "Hungarian-American mathematician, aerospace engineer and physicist\n\"Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n\" redirects here.
