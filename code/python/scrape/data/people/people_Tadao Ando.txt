{"name": "Tadao Ando", "content": "Tadao Ando (\u5b89\u85e4 \u5fe0\u96c4, And\u014d Tadao, born 13 September 1941) is a Japanese self-taught architect[1][2] whose approach to architecture and landscape was categorized by architectural historian Francesco Dal Co as \"critical regionalism\". He is the winner of the 1995 Pritzker Prize.\n Ando was born a few years before his little brother in 1941 in Osaka, Japan.[3] At the age of two, his family chose to separate them, and have Tadao live with his great grandmother.[3] He worked as a boxer and fighter before settling on the profession of architect, despite never having formal training in the field. Struck by the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Imperial Hotel on a trip to Tokyo as a second-year high school student, he eventually decided to end his boxing career less than two years after graduating from high school to pursue architecture.[4] He attended night classes to learn drawing and took correspondence courses on interior design.[5] He visited buildings designed by renowned architects like Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Louis Kahn before returning to Osaka in 1968 to establish his own design studio, Tadao Ando Architects and Associates.[6]\n Ando was raised in Japan where the religion and style of life strongly influenced his architecture and design. Ando's architectural style is said to create a \"haiku\" effect, emphasizing nothingness and empty space to represent the beauty of simplicity. He favors designing complex spatial circulation while maintaining the appearance of simplicity. A self-taught architect, he keeps his Japanese culture and language in mind while he travels around Europe for research. As an architect, he believes that architecture can change society, that \"to change the dwelling is to change the city and to reform society\".[7] \"Reform society\" could be a promotion of a place or a change of the identity of that place. Werner Blaser has said, \"Good buildings by Tadao Ando create memorable identity and therefore publicity, which in turn attracts the public and promotes market penetration\".[8]\n The simplicity of his architecture emphasizes the concept of sensation and physical experiences, mainly influenced by Japanese culture. The religious term Zen, focuses on the concept of simplicity and concentrates on inner feeling rather than outward appearance. Zen influences vividly show in Ando's work and became its distinguishing mark. In order to practice the idea of simplicity, Ando's architecture is mostly constructed with concrete, providing a sense of cleanliness and weightlessness (even though concrete is a heavy material) at the same time.[9] Due to the simplicity of the exterior, construction, and organization of the space are relatively potential in order to represent the aesthetic of sensation.Ando once came to Mumbai where he met Indian architects like B.V.Doshi,Charles Correa  and Bijoy Jain.\n Besides Japanese religious architecture, Ando has also designed Christian churches, such as the Church of the Light (1989) and the Church in Tarumi (1993).[10] Although Japanese and Christian churches display distinct characteristics, Ando treats them in a similar way. He believes there should be no difference in designing religious architecture and houses. As he explains,\n We do not need to differentiate one from the other. Dwelling in a house is not only a functional issue, but also a spiritual one. The house is the locus of heart (kokoro), and the heart is the locus of god. Dwelling in a house is a search for the heart (kokoro) as the locus of god, just as one goes to church to search for god. An important role of the church is to enhance this sense of the spiritual. In a spiritual place, people find peace in their heart (kokoro), as in their homeland.[11] Besides speaking of the spirit of architecture, Ando also emphasises the association between nature and architecture.[12][13] He intends for people to easily experience the spirit and beauty of nature through architecture. He believes architecture is responsible for performing the attitude of the site and makes it visible. This not only represents his theory of the role of architecture in society but also shows why he spends so much time studying architecture from physical experience.\n In 1995, Ando won the Pritzker Prize for architecture, considered the highest distinction in the field.[2] He donated the $100,000 prize money to the orphans of the 1995 Kobe earthquake.[14]\n Tadao Ando's body of work is known for the creative use of natural light and for structures that follow natural forms of the landscape, rather than disturbing the landscape by making it conform to the constructed space of a building. Ando's buildings are often characterized by complex three-dimensional circulation paths. These paths weave in between interior and exterior spaces formed both inside large-scale geometric shapes and in the spaces between them.\n His \"Row House in Sumiyoshi\" (Azuma House, \u4f4f\u5409\u306e\u9577\u5c4b), a small two-story, cast-in-place concrete house completed in 1976, is an early work which began to show elements of his characteristic style. It consists of three equal rectangular volumes: two enclosed volumes of interior spaces separated by an open courtyard. The courtyard's position between the two interior volumes becomes an integral part of the house's circulation system. The house is famous for the contrast between appearance and spatial organization which allow people to experience the richness of the space within the geometry.[15]\n Ando's housing complex at Rokko, just outside Kobe, is a complex warren of terraces and balconies, atriums and shafts. The designs for Rokko Housing One (1983) and for Rokko Housing Two (1993) illustrate a range of issues in traditional architectural vocabulary\u2014the interplay of solid and void, the alternatives of open and closed, the contrasts of light and darkness. More significantly, Ando's noteworthy engineering achievement in these clustered buildings is site specific\u2014the structures survived undamaged after the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995.[16] New York Times architectural critic Paul Goldberger argues that:\n Ando is right in the Japanese tradition: spareness has always been a part of Japanese architecture, at least since the 16th century; [and] it is not without reason that Frank Lloyd Wright more freely admitted to the influences of Japanese architecture than of anything American.\"[16] Like Wright's Imperial Hotel in Tokyo Second Imperial Hotel 1923-1968, which did survive the Great Kant\u014d earthquake of 1923, site specific decision-making, anticipates seismic activity in several of Ando's Hy\u014dgo-Awaji buildings.[17]\n Asahi Beer Oyamazaki Villa Museum of Art, Kyoto\n Lincoln park house, Chicago\n Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, showing the reflecting pool\n Himeji City Museum of Literature\n Azuma House\n View from Akita Museum of Art\n Mount Rokko Chapel\n Suntory Museum, showing the staircase and the inside structure\n City Museum of Literature\n Chikatsu Asuka museum\n Awaji Yumebutai in Awaji, Hyogo prefecture, Japan\n Awaji Yumebutai, showing the view and the stairs down\n Suntory Museum, the parallelepiped intersecting the spherical body of the IMAX theatre, shown in profile\n Rokko Housing I and II, Kobe\n Vitra Conference Pavillon\n Langen Foundation at night\n ", "tags": ["1941 births", "Living people", "People from Osaka", "Tadao Ando buildings", "20th-century Japanese architects", "21st-century Japanese architects", "Kyoto laureates in Arts and Philosophy", "Pritzker Architecture Prize winners", "Osaka University of Arts alumni", "University of Tokyo faculty", "Columbia University faculty", "Recipients of the Royal Gold Medal", "Recipients of the Order of Culture", "Recipients of the Praemium Imperiale", "Members of the Acad\u00e9mie d'architecture", "Officiers of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres", "Japanese male boxers", "Honorary Members of the Royal Academy", "CS1 Korean-language sources (ko)", "Webarchive template wayback links", "CS1 Italian-language sources (it)", "Articles with short description", "Short description matches Wikidata", "Articles with hCards", "Articles containing Japanese-language text", "BLP articles lacking sources from June 2013", "All BLP articles lacking sources", "Commons category link is on Wikidata", "Wikipedia articles with BIBSYS identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CANTIC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with CINII identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NLP identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NSK identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RERO identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with RKDartists identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with ULAN identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers", "Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers", "AC with 25 elements"], "raw": "Japanese architect\nTadao AndoTadao Ando in 2004Born (1941-09-13) 13 September 1941 (age\u00a079)Minato-ku, Osaka, JapanNationalityFrenchOccupationArchitectAwardsAlvar Aalto Medal, 1985Carlsberg Architectural Prize, 1992Pritzker Prize, 1995RIBA Royal Gold Medal, 1997AIA Gold Medal, 2002Neutra Medal for Professional Excellence, 2012PracticeTadao Ando Architects & AssociatesBuildingsRow House, Sumiyoshi, 1979Church of the Light, Osaka, 1989Water Temple, Awaji, 1991ProjectsRokko Housing I, II, III, Kobe, 1983\u20131999\n\nTadao Ando (\u5b89\u85e4 \u5fe0\u96c4, And\u014d Tadao, born 13 September 1941) is a Japanese self-taught architect[1][2] whose approach to architecture and landscape was categorized by architectural historian Francesco Dal Co as \"critical regionalism\".
