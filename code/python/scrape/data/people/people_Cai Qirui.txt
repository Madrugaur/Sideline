He was known as the founder of Chinese catalytic chemistry.[1]\n Cai graduated from Xiamen University in 1937, majoring in chemistry. He became a teaching assistant at Xiamen University. He moved to Ohio State University by government study abroad scholarship in 1947 and earned his doctoral degree in 1950. He was forbidden to leave the United States after the Korean War broke. The travel ban on Cai was lifted in 1955 as the result of a swap for 11 U.S. airmen held captive by China since the end of the Korean War.
